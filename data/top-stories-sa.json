They've taken a hit in response to weaker-than-expected steel consumption, completion of pre-holiday restocking and possible output restrictions. On the Singapore Exchange, benchmark October iron ore was 3.2% lower at $117.25 a tonne.

Weighing on prices of the key steelmaking ingredient are also \"concerns of tighter monetary policy\", analysts at ANZ bank said in a note. — with Reuters",
