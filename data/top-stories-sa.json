The man first tried to enter the Vatican at St Ann's Gate, but the Swiss Guard turned him away, the statement said. He then raced back through the gate at high speed, as well as a second checkpoint near the back of St Peter's Basilica.

G7 leaders are gathering in Hiroshima on Friday and the invasion of Ukraine is high on the agenda: A U.S. official, speaking to reporters on Thursday ahead of the gathering, said the G7's latest efforts were aimed at disrupting Russia's ability to get materials it needs for the battlefield, close loopholes used to evade sanctions, further reduce international reliance on Russian energy, and narrow Moscow's access to the international financial system. \"Our commitment to continue tightening the screws on Russia remains as strong as it was last year,\" the official said. The United States and its allies, including the European Union and Britain, have continued to ratchet up sanctions and export-control pressure on Russia since the invasion of Ukraine began in February 2022. Thousands of targets hit with sanctions by Washington so far have included Russian President Vladimir Putin, the financial sector and oligarchs. The latest U.S. sanctions package will include \"extensively restricting categories of goods key to the battlefield\" as well as preventing some 70 entities from Russia and third countries from receiving U.S. exports by adding them to the U.S. Commerce Department's blacklist. In addition, the United States will announce some 300 new sanctions against individuals, entities, vessels and aircraft targeting \"financial facilitators\", Russia's future energy extracting capabilities, and others across Europe, the Middle East and Asia helping to support the war. U.S. sanctions authorities would also be expanded to more sectors of the Russian economy. The U.S. official said Washington would take significant steps to align its actions closely with the EU and Britain to ensure that the G7 remained as coordinated as possible in response to \"Russia's brutal actions\".",
