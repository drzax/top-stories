She says the tragedy will resonate with the community for quite some time. \"Which is why Redland City Council spent most of yesterday making sure that we've got the appropriate resources on the island and on the mainland to wrap around the community and those people who are first responders or have been impacted by this tragic event,\" she says. Disaster chaplains and community support are made available to residents and a space has been set up for people who want to pay their respects or need assistance. Williams says the island, which is home to about 3,500 people, is a very small and tight-knit community. \"Everybody knows everybody and, at the same time, they're all there to make sure that they support each other,\" she says. \"I just think they are still reeling at this whole event. It's so tragic.\"",

As I mentioned earlier, there are no major results out today, but Tuesday sees building materials firm James Hardie report. Wednesday is dominated by financial services, notably CBA, which is expected by analysts at Morgans to crack the $10 billion mark for cash profit, up 5.6% for the year. Economists will be watching for any signs that bad mortgage and business debts are on the rise. Suncorp is also worth a watch, after ANZ had its takeover offer for the insurer's banking division knocked back by the ACCC last week. Insurance profits are also a hot topic, with premiums having surged over the past year. Thursday is busy. AMP is always one that a lot of retail shareholders are interested in. QBE will also be scrutinised for its insurance profit margins and premium increases. AGL will likewise face scrutiny due to massive energy price rises, especially after recent upgrades to its profit guidance. Downer EDI has already flagged its bad news of a massive earnings downgrade. Building materials firm Boral will offer some insights into construction materials costs, which have shown signs of easing from recent highs, and the strength of demand in the building sector. Friday is quieter, with takeover target gold miner Newcrest the main point of interest. REA Group may have some interesting commentary on the property market, while Baby Bunting Group will be an early test of retail. Exactly how discretionary are prams, baby seats and onesies?

Bain first approached the company about a buyout in March this year at an initial offer price of $3.00. Estia's board has agreed to the latest offer as it represents a 50% premium to its closing share price of $2.14 on March 21, the last trading day before Bain's initial offer was made. The $3.20 per share cash price will be reduced by any dividends paid out by Estia before completion. Estia says it's permitted to pay up to 12 cents a share in full-franked dividends, which would result in up to 5 cents per share in franking credit benefits to shareholders. A shareholder meeting to vote on the deal is expected to be held in November, with completion of the takeover by the end of this year.",
