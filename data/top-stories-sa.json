(Remember for live figures, head to the top of the blog and expand the pinned post and scroll down for the full quote list). The slip is thanks to investors being disappointed by China's policymakers and its smaller-than-expected lending rate cuts (more on that in a moment). It is a mixed bag across the sectors — consumer non-cyclicals are down 0.9%, health care has dropped 0.6%, and financials and basic materials are down 0.3% each. For the academic and educational sector, it's gained 1.4% — the most out of any sector today — while consumer cyclicals are up 1.1% and energy has gained 0.7%. As for the top five movers so far today: Breville Group +14% Premier Investments +13% Lovisa Holdings +6.8% NIB Holdings +6.6% Paladin Energy +5.8% And the bottom five movers for the day: Iress -29.4% A2 Milk Company -11.7% Reliance Worldwide -8.85 Elders -7.4% Vicinity Centres -3.4%",

AGL signed the structured transition agreement which will allow the company to coordinate the retirement of the station — which is Victoria's largest electricity generator — with the state government. Last September, AGL brought forward the closure of Loy Yang by a decade to 2035, after buckling to the pressure placed on them by investors and lenders. The deal also allows for the closure of the coal-fired plant earlier than scheduled, provided it's not needed for \"the reliable and secure supply of electricity in Victoria\", as long as it was given the green light by the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO).",
