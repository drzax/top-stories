You can see a video of part of her statement in our last post. The 85-year-old spoke to the media in Tel Aviv about what conditions were like in Gaza, after she was taken from her kibbutz in Israel on the back of a motorbike. \"[We] walked for a few kilometres on the wet grounds. There are a huge, huge network of tunnels underneath. It looks like a spider web,\" Ms Lifshitz said, according to her daughter who was translating. \"We reached a big hole where some 25 kidnapped were concentrated.\" She said a lot of women had been taken hostage, and a doctor came to check on the hostages every two or three days. \"They were gentle with us, our needs were supplied, they were prepared for this, they were prepared for a very long time, including the needs of the women,\" she said, according to a different translator.",
