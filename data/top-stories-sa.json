Disney CEO Bob Iger was discussing the entertainment giant's quarterly results overnight, and announced that it would be hiking the price of its ad-free tier of the Disney+ streaming service by 27% — taking it to $US13.99 a month for those in the US. The price increase will take effect in the US from October 12, and is planning to roll out the higher subscription payments to its European customers from December. Meanwhile Disney is also going to introduce lower cost, ad-supported streaming plans to Canada, the UK and other European markets from November 1 at a lower price point. Cracking down on password-sharin g is also firmly in Disney's sights, with Iger saying they plan to roll out a strategy similar to what Netflix has recently unveiled \"sometime in 2024\". Right now Disney hasn't said whether the price increase will affect those of us here in Australia — but given the increases we've seen with other streaming services like Netflix and Spotify, it seems to be a matter of when it affects us, not if .",

ANZ monitors the spending made through its cards and merchant payment facilities (i.e. point-of-sale terminals) to get a near-real time pulse on consumer spending. There isn't much of one. Over the week to August 5, spending dived 8% compared with the same period a year earlier. Considering how much prices have risen for most things over that year, that is a huge fall in the volume of goods and services being purchased. As you can see, Aussies cut spending on almost everything, even staples like groceries. The only sector going up was entertainment, driven by a 95% jump in cinema spending as the Barbie movie and Oppenheimer opened at the same time, the so-called \"Barbenheimer\" effect. We're not even going out for meals or drinks anymore, with dining-out spending now below pre-pandemic levels in 2019. \"The ongoing softness in ANZ-observed spending, alongside the weak ABS household spending indicator and negative retail volumes print, suggests the RBA's efforts to curb spending are working,\" note ANZ economists Madeline Dunk and Adelaide Timbrell. \"Many households are facing a cashflow squeeze and are adjusting by curbing spending.\"",
