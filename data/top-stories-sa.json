Locals have already begun to question why it took the region's water authority, Southern Rural Water, so long to begin draining Lake Glenmaggie, which has contributed to the flooding along the Macalister River. Newry dairy farmer Tim Dwyer told the ABC given the weather forecast, the lake should have been drained earlier. \"When there was a major flood warning at Licola they only had 4,500 megalitres being released,\" Mr Dwyer said. \"That's not acceptable. \"We've had a forecast for this rain for about a week now.\" But Southern Rural Water's managing director Cameron Fitzgerald has defended the organisation's actions, saying the weather conditions affecting the region exceeded expectations. \"Two days ago we had bushfires, we are in an El Nino event and we do need water for people later in the season to be able to continue to grow their produces, fruit and vegetables and create milk,\" Mr Fitzgerald said. \"So we are always thinking about the full balance of how we manage this storage. \"Obviously this event was a bit bigger than the event we had planned for,\" he said.",

Let's take a look at one. Disinformation: The provision of pencils at polling places by the AEC is part of a plan by the AEC, or officers of the AEC, to change the referendum result by rubbing out votes. This is the response from the AEC to that claim: The AEC provides pencils as they do not smudge when a ballot paper is folded, they can be stored and re-used from one event to the next, they don't run dry in tropical locations and they are cheaper than other implements. Voters are permitted to bring their own pen to mark the ballot paper with if they wish. Pencil marks are not erased. Polling officials are never alone with ballot papers - there are layers of supervision in place during the count and scrutineers are able to be present during counting. Suggestions of a conspiracy to overturn a referendum result by erasing ballot papers simply does not account for the transparency or scale of the process, let alone the history of high integrity Australian electoral events.",

Consumer discretionary rose 2%, leading S & P 500 sectors higher, as US Treasury yields eased off 16-year highs. The ADP National Employment Report was cheered by investors worried about rising interest rates and the likelihood that the Federal Reserve may need to keep rates higher for longer. \"On a technical basis, we're probably a little bit oversold,\" said Oliver Pursche, senior vice president and advisor for Wealthspire Advisors in Westport, Connecticut. Recent weakness had brought the S & P 500 near its 200-day moving average, currently at around 4,203. \"This September we saw a shift in both strategist and investor belief,\" he said. \"It seems like it finally sunk in that interest rates are going to remain higher for longer, and that the idea that the Fed is going to cut rates any time soon is fictional.\" The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 127.17 points, or 0.39%, to 33,129.55, the S & P 500 gained 34.3 points, or 0.81%, at 4,263.75 and the Nasdaq Composite added 176.54 points, or 1.35%, at 13,236.01.
