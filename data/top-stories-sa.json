He says loan arrears remain low despite interest rates rising steeply to 4.1 per cent over the past year. \"Only $6 of every $1,000 in our Australian home loan portfolio was overdue by more than 90 days. \"That is better than it was before the pandemic.\" Mr Elliott says ANZ customers are \"faring extremely well\" and people are still saving, although the bank has seen a modest increase in customers \"reaching out to us for help\". \"So people are actually in remarkably good shape,\" he says. \"Now, there are clearly those that are struggling, but it's a relatively modest amount.\" \"If I look at things like the calls we get coming into our call centres in asking for help. \" \"Those are up a little bit.\" \"And if we look back over time, is still lower than they would have been prior to COVID.\"",
