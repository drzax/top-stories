They have no beds. They're putting patients in the corridors. \"We have supplies for one-and-a-half months, but that's on regular days. In war days, the consumption increases more than 50 to 70 per cent. \"This storage of medications will last 10-14 days maximum. Local markets cannot deliver anything for us and we can't get anything from outside. \"We have enough fuel for four or five days maximum. The hospital will stop activities, we will close the doors.\" The World Health Organization says four hospitals in northern Gaza are no longer functioning as a result of damage and targeting and 21 hospitals in the Gaza Strip have received instructions from Israeli forces to evacuate. \"Forced evacuation of hospitals may amount to a violation of International Humanitarian Law.\"",
