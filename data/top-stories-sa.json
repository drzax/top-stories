Just down the road from the ABC's Jerusalem bureau is a handwritten sign strung up outside someone's house. In Hebrew it reads: \"First, release the hostages.\" It's a sentiment shared by many people in Israel. Some families of the hostages say they would have preferred that Israel's government negotiates the release of their loved ones before escalating their ground incursion in Gaza. Among those missing are Tal and Adi Shoham, their son Naveh and daughter Yahel. Tal's dad Gilad Korngold says he trusts the Israeli army to make the right decisions, though three weeks into this crisis, he's struggling to hold onto hope. \"There was a lot of hope. Now [there's] less. Every day with no signs from them, it's terrible,\" he said. A military liaison stays in regular contact with Gilad, but he says they came up with an arrangement that helps him get through the night without lying there waiting for the phone to ring. \"He is coming three times a week to my house to talk to us, but we agreed that if something terrible happened, he will not call me up that night.\"",

We would continue to publicly assert that Israel should abide by these,” she said. “We have seen a devastating loss of innocent life. There are ongoing civilian deaths … you’ve seen the international response. The reality is the international community won’t accept ongoing civilian deaths. “So when friends like Australia urge Israel to exercise restraint and protect civilian lives it is really critical that Israel listens.\" Pressed on whether she would condemn Israeli air strikes on Gaza's Jabalia refugee camp, which the United Nations Human Rights Office has expressed could amount to war crimes, Senator Wong reiterated Australia’s position is to urge Israel to protect civilian lives and observe international law. “We want you to exercise restraint because this matters for those innocent civilians who should not be paying for those atrocities of Hamas who does not represent the Palestinian people,” she said. Wong says the Australian government is supporting those families and Australian citizens who got out overnight, and will keep working to ensure they get as many Australians out as possible.",

Lending in that category over the last three months is 27.7per cent lower than the same quarter last year. The Housing Industry Association's senior economist, Tom Devitt blames the Reserve Bank's interest rate hiking cycle. \"Lending activity has been weighed down by the fastest increase in interest rates in a generation. This is drying up the pipeline of new home building work across the country.\" He warns it means there will be fewer new housing starts next year. \"There are very long lags in this cycle due to the record high volume of building work that was in the pipeline when the RBA first raised rates in May 2022. The volume of houses under construction only started declining in the June quarter of 2023, and remains elevated, a year after the first increase in the cash rate. \"This large volume of building work has obscured the impact of these rate rises on the broader economy, especially unemployment, as the building industry employs over one million Australians.\" Mr Devitt ended with this warning: \"This slowdown in lending for new housing will make it increasingly difficult to reach the Australian government's target of building 1.2 million new homes in five years.\"",
