              "plaintext": "The Australian dollar experienced a decent rise after the nation's biggest trading partner, China, acted to slow a recent slide in the yuan. By 3:10pm AEST, the local currency had jumped 0.7% to 67.15 US cents. However, it was still well short of the recent peak at 69 US cents. China's offshore yuan had hit a seven-month low early on Tuesday, then it recovered slightly after the country's central bank set a higher domestic fix than expected. The People's Bank of China (PBOC) set the yuan midpoint rate at 7.2098 per US dollar prior to market open, weaker than the previous fix 7.2056 (but nearly 100 pips stronger than Reuters' consensus estimate). The fixing was the biggest upward deviation the PBOC has made since May when the current yuan selloff began, analysts said. The PBOC allows the yuan to trade as much as 2% above or below the fixing on any given day. Reserve Bank's next decision will affect dollar's movements The Aussie dollar is often used as a liquid proxy for the yuan given China is by far the biggest buyer of Australian resources and the world's largest consumer of commodities. However, investors have become increasingly frustrated by the lack of a major new fiscal stimulus package from Beijing and suspect policy makers are content to use a weaker currency as a boost to its exporters. Softness in Chinese steel output and real estate development was also weighing on prices for iron ore, Australia's single biggest export earner. Earlier this month, the Aussie dollar was boosted by an interest rate hike by the Reserve Bank, but markets are divided on whether it will lift rates again at its July policy meeting next week. A lot will depend on monthly consumer price data for May due on Wednesday where median forecasts are for a slowdown in annual inflation to 6.1%, from 6.8%. Analysts caution that much of the pullback will be due to a drop in volatile fuel prices and core inflation could prove stubborn.",
