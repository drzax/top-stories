Assange has been held in London's Belmarsh Prison for more than four years, as the US seeks to extradite him over 18 charges relating to the publishing of tens of thousands of military and diplomatic documents. \"I know it's frustrating. I share the frustration. I can't do more than make very clear what my position is,\" Albanese says. \"And the US administration is certainly very aware of what the Australian government's position is.\" The PM says Australia is working through diplomatic channels to make its position known, calling for Assange's case to be \"brought to a conclusion\".

They are also seeking damages for non-economic losses like distress, frustration and disappointment. \"This was one of the most serious data breaches in Australia's history,\" Slater and Gordon class action practice group leader Ben Hardwick said. \"Medibank should have had adequate measures in place to prevent all of this, yet they didn't.\" Reporting by AAP"

Napoli's triumph ended the city's long wait for the Scudetto since Argentine great Diego Maradona led them to two championships in 1986-87 and 1989-90. A second-half goal by Victor Osimhen secured Napoli the title with five games remaining in the season. As the final whistle blew, Napoli supporters rushed onto the pitch to celebrate the momentous occasion alongside the players. Napoli have 80 points, securing their position at the top of the table. Second-placed Lazio, who also have five games left to play, are 16 points behind."

Russia claims the US was behind what it says was a drone attack on the Kremlin which aimed to kill President Vladimir Putin. White House national security spokesperson John Kirby says there is still no conclusive evidence as to the authenticity of a video showing the alleged drone attack. Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov, without providing evidence, said Ukraine had acted on US orders when it launched what Russia said was a drone attack on the Kremlin building in the early hours of Wednesday morning. \"We know very well that decisions about such actions, about such terrorist attacks, are made not in Kyiv but in Washington,\" Mr Peskov said. Kirby said the US did not encourage or enable Ukraine to strike outside its borders. \"I can assure you that there was no involvement by the United States in this. Whatever it was did not involve us,\" Mr Kirby told cable news network MSNBC. \"We still don't really know what happened.\" Ukraine also denied involvement in the incident, which followed a string of explosions over the past week targeting freight trains and oil depots in western Russia and Russian-controlled Crimea."

Russia claims the US was behind what it says was a drone attack on the Kremlin which aimed to kill President Vladimir Putin. White House national security spokesperson John Kirby says there is still no conclusive evidence as to the authenticity of a video showing the alleged drone attack. Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov, without providing evidence, said Ukraine had acted on US orders when it launched what Russia said was a drone attack on the Kremlin building in the early hours of Wednesday morning. \"We know very well that decisions about such actions, about such terrorist attacks, are made not in Kyiv but in Washington,\" Mr Peskov said. Kirby said the US did not encourage or enable Ukraine to strike outside its borders. \"I can assure you that there was no involvement by the United States in this. Whatever it was did not involve us,\" Mr Kirby told cable news network MSNBC. \"We still don't really know what happened.\" Ukraine also denied involvement in the incident, which followed a string of explosions over the past week targeting freight trains and oil depots in western Russia and Russian-controlled Crimea.",

                  "headline": "ANZ posts record interim profit, earnings on loans up",
                  "articleBody": "ANZ's reported a half-year cash profit of $3.8 billion, up 12 per cent when compared with the prior half. Statutory profit after tax for the half year ended March 31, 2023, was $3.5 billion, down 1 per cent. Net interest margin (which is what banks earn on loans) increased 10 basis points to 1.75 per cent. ANZ shareholders will get an interim dividend of 81 cents per share, up from 72 cents a share a year ago. ANZ Chief Executive Officer, Shayne Elliott, said it was a record profit result. “This was a strong financial performance in  which all four divisions made a material contribution,\" Mr Elliott said. \"The record result was driven by solid  revenue growth across the board and the benefits of having a well-diversified business.\" Mr Elliott also warned of tough times ahead. “The next six months will be more difficult than the last. Competition in retail  banking is as intense as it has ever been, both in Australia and New Zealand,\" Mr Elliott said. \"We  understand that sustained higher inflation and interest rates create further challenges for  some households and businesses across the economy. While the number of ANZ customers  in difficulty remains low, we stand ready to help in these potentially challenging times.  “ ANZ also revealed 26 per cent of its customers are on interest rates higher than their assessed interest rate, which would make it very difficult to refinance. Yesterday, National Australia Bank's statutory net profit was just shy of $4 billion for the six months to March 31, up 19 per cent on the same period a year earlier. The bank's preferred measure of cash profit lifted to $4.07 billion, propelled by business lending and margin growth. The cash profit climbed 17 per cent in the six months ended March 31, compared to the $3.48 billion in the same period last year. The result was below market expectations. NAB declared an 83c interim dividend, up from 73 cents in the same period last year."

                  "articleBody": "Apple reported quarterly revenue and profit above Wall Street's expectations, with iPhone sales rising and wearables sales slipping less than analysts expected. Apple said sales for its fiscal second quarter ending April 1 fell 2.5 per cent to $US94.84 billion. That was better than analyst expectations of a 4.4 per cent decline to $US93 billion, according to data from Refinitiv. Profit was flat at $US1.52 per share, compared with estimates of a 5.7 pe cent fall to $US1.43 per share, according to Refinitiv data. Apple shares were up 1.6 per cent in after-hours trading. The broader consumer electronics industry is grappling with a decline in sales of smartphones, tablets and PCs as consumers and businesses who bought up electronics during the pandemic, tighten spending amid rising interest rates and economic uncertainty. Apple also held its dividend and stock buyback programs roughly in line with its last update to them a year ago, approving $US90 billion in additional buybacks. Apple CEO Tim Cook said the company had set a fiscal second-quarter record for iPhone sales, thanks in part to picking up new users in markets such as India. \"We were thrilled by our performance in emerging markets,\" Mr Cook said. \"We set records for the iPhone-installed base in every geographic segment, and we had very strong 'new to' (sales in) emerging markets, particularly in Brazil, India and Mexico.\" Mr Cook also said supply-chain snarls had vanished. \"We had no material shortages at all during the quarter across any of the products,\" he said. However, sales of Macs fell more than 30 per cent sharply while iPad revenue slipped. Sales in China also dropped 2.9 per cent to $US17.8 billion, a slightly larger drop than overall revenue. IPhone sales rose 1.5 per cent to $5YS1.33 billion, compared with analyst expectations of a 3.3 per cent decline to $US48.9 billion, according to Refinitiv. Those results occurred against the backdrop of a 13 per cent. Sales in Apple's wearables business, which includes devices like AirPods and the Apple Watch, fell less than 1 per cent compared with estimates of a 4.4 per cent drop. Apple's biggest growth segment was its services business, which includes products like iCloud and Apple Pay, which grew 5.5 per cent to $US20.9 billion, in line with analyst expectations. Mr Cook said Apple now has 975 million subscribers on its platform, which includes both Apple services and third-party apps, up from 935 million last quarter and an increase of 150 million from a year ago. - with Reuters"

                  "articleBody": "The European Central Bank slowed the pace of its interest rate increases on Thursday but signalled more tightening to come in what markets expect to be the final stage of its fight against inflation. All ECB policymakers but one, Austria's Robert Holzmann, supported the 25-basis-point increase in the ECB's main deposit rate to 3.25 per cent, which follows a series of 75 and 50-basis-point increases since last July. Inflation across the 20 countries that share the euro is still stubbornly high and the ECB was at pains to say that borrowing costs would have to rise further. \"We are not pausing — that is very clear,\" ECB president Christine Lagarde told a press conference. \"We know that we have more ground to cover.\" Ms Lagarde added that interest rates were not yet \"sufficiently restrictive\" to get inflation down to the ECB's 2 per cent target and made reference to future \"policy decisions\", suggesting that more than one additional rate rise could be on the cards. The ECB's shift in gear came just a day after the US Federal Reserve also raised its benchmark rate by a quarter of a percentage point, which it hinted could be the last in its own historic series of increases. The slowdown in the pace of monetary policy tightening comes only days after euro zone banking data showed the biggest drop in demand for loans in over a decade. This suggests that previous rate rises are being transmitted \"forcefully\" to the economy but with the usual lags, the ECB said, a comment economists took as a key justification for slowing the pace of hikes. - with Reuters"

                  "headline": "Wall Street drops on banking worries",
                  "articleBody": "In the US, the benchmark S & P 500 declined 0.7 per cent to end the session at 4,061. It was its fourth-straight session of declines. The Nasdaq declined 0.5 per cent to 11,966, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 0.9 per cent to 33,127. The sell-off came as fears grew about the strength of the US banking sector. PacWest's stock slumped more than 40 per cent in afternoon trading, dropping to a record low. Western Alliance shares pared losses after plummeting by nearly 60 per cent following a Financial Times report that the lender was exploring strategic options, including a potential sale of all or part of its business. However, Western Alliance denied the report, calling it \"categorically false in all respects\", and said it was weighing legal options against the newspaper. The bank's stock was down nearly 35 per cent in afternoon trading. Western Alliance has been seeking to reassure investors about its financial stability. It comes as First Republic's collapse, the third major casualty of the biggest crisis to hit the US banking sector since 2008, rekindled a slide in shares of regional lenders this week despite regulatory efforts to staunch the turmoil that began with the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank in March. US officials at the federal and state levels are assessing the possibility of \"market manipulation\" behind big moves in banking share prices in recent days, Reuters has reported. \"Nobody knows where these banks should be trading at because what we saw with Silicon Valley Bank is that the fundamentals can change so quickly,\" Tom Plumb, portfolio manager at Plumb Balanced Fund said. \"This normally would have been a great opportunity to buy banks with premier regional presence and it may be, but the real concern is nobody knows what the rules are and what they are valued at,\" Mr Plumb added. The KBW Regional Banking index dropped 3.3 per cent. Major U.S. banks were also losing ground on Thursday, with the S & P 500 Banks index falling nearly 3 per cent. JPMorgan's shares fell 1.4 per cent, while Bank of America declined 3 per cent. The common theme among the banking stocks that have sold off sharply is that they reported large deposit declines in the first quarter, said Truist Securities analyst Brandon King, while calling the sell-off \"overdone.\" PacWest Bancorp reported a loss of $1.1 billion attributed to shareholders for the first quarter of the year. - with Reuters"

Statutory profit after tax for the half year ended March 31, 2023, was $3.5 billion, down 1 per cent. Net interest margin (which is what banks earn on loans) increased 10 basis points to 1.75 per cent. ANZ shareholders will get an interim dividend of 81 cents per share, up from 72 cents a share a year ago. ANZ Chief Executive Officer, Shayne Elliott, said it was a record profit result. “This was a strong financial performance in  which all four divisions made a material contribution,\" Mr Elliott said. \"The record result was driven by solid  revenue growth across the board and the benefits of having a well-diversified business.\" Mr Elliott also warned of tough times ahead. “The next six months will be more difficult than the last. Competition in retail  banking is as intense as it has ever been, both in Australia and New Zealand,\" Mr Elliott said. \"We  understand that sustained higher inflation and interest rates create further challenges for  some households and businesses across the economy. While the number of ANZ customers  in difficulty remains low, we stand ready to help in these potentially challenging times.  “ ANZ also revealed 26 per cent of its customers are on interest rates higher than their assessed interest rate, which would make it very difficult to refinance. Yesterday, National Australia Bank's statutory net profit was just shy of $4 billion for the six months to March 31, up 19 per cent on the same period a year earlier. The bank's preferred measure of cash profit lifted to $4.07 billion, propelled by business lending and margin growth. The cash profit climbed 17 per cent in the six months ended March 31, compared to the $3.48 billion in the same period last year. The result was below market expectations. NAB declared an 83c interim dividend, up from 73 cents in the same period last year.",

Apple said sales for its fiscal second quarter ending April 1 fell 2.5 per cent to $US94.84 billion. That was better than analyst expectations of a 4.4 per cent decline to $US93 billion, according to data from Refinitiv. Profit was flat at $US1.52 per share, compared with estimates of a 5.7 pe cent fall to $US1.43 per share, according to Refinitiv data. Apple shares were up 1.6 per cent in after-hours trading. The broader consumer electronics industry is grappling with a decline in sales of smartphones, tablets and PCs as consumers and businesses who bought up electronics during the pandemic, tighten spending amid rising interest rates and economic uncertainty. Apple also held its dividend and stock buyback programs roughly in line with its last update to them a year ago, approving $US90 billion in additional buybacks. Apple CEO Tim Cook said the company had set a fiscal second-quarter record for iPhone sales, thanks in part to picking up new users in markets such as India. \"We were thrilled by our performance in emerging markets,\" Mr Cook said. \"We set records for the iPhone-installed base in every geographic segment, and we had very strong 'new to' (sales in) emerging markets, particularly in Brazil, India and Mexico.\" Mr Cook also said supply-chain snarls had vanished. \"We had no material shortages at all during the quarter across any of the products,\" he said. However, sales of Macs fell more than 30 per cent sharply while iPad revenue slipped. Sales in China also dropped 2.9 per cent to $US17.8 billion, a slightly larger drop than overall revenue. IPhone sales rose 1.5 per cent to $5YS1.33 billion, compared with analyst expectations of a 3.3 per cent decline to $US48.9 billion, according to Refinitiv. Those results occurred against the backdrop of a 13 per cent. Sales in Apple's wearables business, which includes devices like AirPods and the Apple Watch, fell less than 1 per cent compared with estimates of a 4.4 per cent drop. Apple's biggest growth segment was its services business, which includes products like iCloud and Apple Pay, which grew 5.5 per cent to $US20.9 billion, in line with analyst expectations. Mr Cook said Apple now has 975 million subscribers on its platform, which includes both Apple services and third-party apps, up from 935 million last quarter and an increase of 150 million from a year ago. - with Reuters",

All ECB policymakers but one, Austria's Robert Holzmann, supported the 25-basis-point increase in the ECB's main deposit rate to 3.25 per cent, which follows a series of 75 and 50-basis-point increases since last July. Inflation across the 20 countries that share the euro is still stubbornly high and the ECB was at pains to say that borrowing costs would have to rise further. \"We are not pausing — that is very clear,\" ECB president Christine Lagarde told a press conference. \"We know that we have more ground to cover.\" Ms Lagarde added that interest rates were not yet \"sufficiently restrictive\" to get inflation down to the ECB's 2 per cent target and made reference to future \"policy decisions\", suggesting that more than one additional rate rise could be on the cards. The ECB's shift in gear came just a day after the US Federal Reserve also raised its benchmark rate by a quarter of a percentage point, which it hinted could be the last in its own historic series of increases. The slowdown in the pace of monetary policy tightening comes only days after euro zone banking data showed the biggest drop in demand for loans in over a decade. This suggests that previous rate rises are being transmitted \"forcefully\" to the economy but with the usual lags, the ECB said, a comment economists took as a key justification for slowing the pace of hikes. - with Reuters",

The Nasdaq declined 0.5 per cent to 11,966, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 0.9 per cent to 33,127. The sell-off came as fears grew about the strength of the US banking sector. PacWest's stock slumped more than 40 per cent in afternoon trading, dropping to a record low. Western Alliance shares pared losses after plummeting by nearly 60 per cent following a Financial Times report that the lender was exploring strategic options, including a potential sale of all or part of its business. However, Western Alliance denied the report, calling it \"categorically false in all respects\", and said it was weighing legal options against the newspaper. The bank's stock was down nearly 35 per cent in afternoon trading. Western Alliance has been seeking to reassure investors about its financial stability. It comes as First Republic's collapse, the third major casualty of the biggest crisis to hit the US banking sector since 2008, rekindled a slide in shares of regional lenders this week despite regulatory efforts to staunch the turmoil that began with the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank in March. US officials at the federal and state levels are assessing the possibility of \"market manipulation\" behind big moves in banking share prices in recent days, Reuters has reported. \"Nobody knows where these banks should be trading at because what we saw with Silicon Valley Bank is that the fundamentals can change so quickly,\" Tom Plumb, portfolio manager at Plumb Balanced Fund said. \"This normally would have been a great opportunity to buy banks with premier regional presence and it may be, but the real concern is nobody knows what the rules are and what they are valued at,\" Mr Plumb added. The KBW Regional Banking index dropped 3.3 per cent. Major U.S. banks were also losing ground on Thursday, with the S & P 500 Banks index falling nearly 3 per cent. JPMorgan's shares fell 1.4 per cent, while Bank of America declined 3 per cent. The common theme among the banking stocks that have sold off sharply is that they reported large deposit declines in the first quarter, said Truist Securities analyst Brandon King, while calling the sell-off \"overdone.\" PacWest Bancorp reported a loss of $1.1 billion attributed to shareholders for the first quarter of the year. - with Reuters",
