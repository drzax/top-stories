He joined Prime Minister Anthony Albanese in the prime minister's courtyard this morning. Mr Albanese said sharing the continent with \"the oldest continuous culture on Earth should be and is a great source of national pride.\" \"In 1927, Jimmy Clements, a Wurundjeri man like our Indigenous affairs minister, walked to Tumut to join with the Duke of York for the opening of parliament here in Canberra, just down the hill. \"He was joined by another Indigenous man, John Noble, the only two Indigenous people at the opening of the parliament. Police tried to remove Clements because he arrived after such a long walk from Tumut, dishevelled and bare foot. \"The crowd rose up and said 'No, Indigenous people have a right to be here.' \"What do they teach us? Like Michael Long, they were prepared to walk a long way to meet us. \"Our journey since 1788 is just a fraction of the journey that Indigenous Australians have had for 65,000 years.\"",

The local share market is set to open lower this morning after mixed results on Wall Street overnight.
