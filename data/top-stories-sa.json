The Hong Kong-flagged Joseph Schulte is the first vessel to set sail since July 16. The ship is currently off the coast of Romania on its way to Türkiye, according to tracking data. It comes as the United States warns that the Russian military is preparing for possible attacks on civilian shipping vessels in the Black Sea. Sea mines also make the voyage risky, and ship insurance costs are likely to be high for operators. Ukraine told authorities that it will \"provide guarantees of compensation for damage\". Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says: \"A safe sea for all. This is Ukraine's and our partners' principled stance. Freedom and safety of navigation are fundamental international principles.\"",

(A reminder that for live figures at any time, head to the pinned post at the top of the blog.) After the frenzy of earnings reports shared before market open, it's sent most of the sectors into the red, with industrials and consumer non-cyclicals barely in positive territory. The academic and education services sector has fallen by 1.1% so far this morning, while consumer cyclicals has dipped by 0.4%. As for the top movers, Inghams is leading the charge (or should I say, the early winner winner, chicken dinner) thanks to their earnings reports this morning, where they posted a 72% increase in their net profit to $60.4 million. The top five movers: Inghams +14.4% IPH +13.5% Super Retail Group +6.3% Orora +5% HomeCo Daily Needs REIT +2.7% And the bottom five movers: Core Lithium -23.9% NRW Holdings -9.1% Lake Resources -8.5% Domain Holdings -8.1% Sayona Mining -8%",

The additional 200,000 homes are on top of the National Housing Accord target that was agreed on by state and territories last year, with $3 billion set aside for the fast-tracking of the builds. Speaking from the country music capital of Tamworth in northern NSW, Mr McEwan said the lack of housing is the biggest barrier that's standing in the way of businesses being able to fill job vacancies, and changes to the planning process across the states was needed. \"I'd say it's [housing] the biggest issue that we've got across Australia,\" he told the ABC's senior business correspondent Peter Ryan. \"So the government's spending time on it and it should be, I think, on the simplification of the planning process. \"That's not to say we want houses built in the wrong places, but the simplification, taking 5, 10 years to get a development up and running is just far too long in this environment and we need action pretty quickly. \"When you come out to places like Tamworth and you see the facilities out here, with the sporting facilities, the council facilities, you realise it’s well served, but it’s getting people into these communities and finding the housing ... that is the biggest problem .\" You can listen to Ross McEwan's full chat with Peter Ryan below:",

It's a return to profitability for the energy company, which reported a loss of $1.4 billion last year. The energy retailer notes that its underlying earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) for energy markets increased by $637 million to $1.038 billion, and that its electricity profits rose as higher wholesale energy costs were recovered in tariffs and the \"optimisation of the energy supply portfolio\". The gains also come despite the global energy crunch, which has sent gas and electricity prices higher. It also forecasts more growth in the coming financial year, before moderating in the 2025 financial year. Origin will pay shareholders a fully-franked final dividend of 20 cents per share .",
