The fall means the ASX is now at its lowest level since November 7 last year, after dropping to its lowest point in more than six months at the close of trade yesterday. Between the RBA flagging future rate hikes and worries about the US labour market and the Federal Reserve's next rate decision, investors are feeling jittery to say the least. Utilities is the only sector seeing positive gains, up 0.6%. All other sectors are in the red, with technology down 1.6%, i ndustrials down 1.5%, and real estate falling by 1.3%. The top movers right now are: Ramelius Resources +2.7% Nufarm +1.8% Orora +1.7% IPH +1.6% Gold Road Resources +1.6% And the bottom performers right now: Core Lithium -6% Weebit Nano -4.5% Polynovo -4.4% Virgin Money UK -4.2% Nanosonics -3.9%",

They say residential mortgage delinquency rates, or the rate at which borrowers have failed to meet their repayments, will continue to rise for the rest of the year as high interest rates and inflation wear down household savings. Data for the latest for residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) from Moody's shows that that the share of prime quality home loans that were at least 30 days in arrears (30+ days delinquency rate) was 1.38% in June 2023, up from 1.25% in March — but are lower than the peak of 1.76% seen during COVID. \"While the Reserve Bank of Australia has paused its cycle of interest rates rises, the central bank's steep rate hikes ... have considerably raised mortgage repayment costs ,\" said Moody's Investors Service vice president, Alena Chen. \"Additionally, inflation, while easing from recent peaks, remains well above the RBA's target range at 5.2%, which means borrowers have to contend with elevated consumer prices and that high interest rates will likely persist for some time. \"The combination of high interest rates and inflation has materially reduced Australia's household savings ratio to 3.2% (the lowest level since 2008), which is weakening the capacity of financially vulnerable borrowers to meet mortgage repayments.\" The report also notes that a number of mortgages are set to come off their lower fixed-rate periods by the end of the year onto higher, variable loans, which will increase the risk of mortgage stress. \"We expect mortgage delinquencies will only rise moderately, because Australia's low unemployment rate (3.7% in August) and recovering housing prices will mitigate risks for borrowers,\" Ms Chen said. \"Additionally, lenders have substantially cut back on risky mortgage lending over recent years, which will further mitigate risks.\"",

              "plaintext": "With petrol prices sticking well above $2 a litre in capital cities, the federal government is facing renewed pressure to step in and provide some relief for motorists by reinstating the fuel excise discount. The fuel excise is the tax on petrol and diesel that's levied by the federal government. It was cut by 22 cents a litre last year, but the Albanese government allowed it to expire. Yesterday the PM was asked if he'd consider cutting the excise again, to which Anthony Albanese said he doesn't make tax policy on the run. But energy economist at the Commonwealth Bank, Vivek Dhar says it isn't the tax that's keeping the prices high — it's all got to do with oil prices. \"We have seen OPEC+, which is a group of countries that control about 40 per cent of global supply, effectively reduce production which has led to this higher oil price environment ,\" he said. \"So that's been really the key driver of higher petrol prices, but what's made this situation worse has been the weakening in the Australian dollar .\" For those who are hoping for relief at the bowser, Mr Dhar says we can expect to be waiting a while. \"There has been an interesting drop in oil prices over the last in 2-3 trading sessions, that's been a 5% fall, so that will give some reprieve,\" he said. \"But our concern is any fall in oil prices will be almost mitigated by falls in the Australian dollar. \"We may be stuck in this petrol price environment of 2.10 to 2.20 a litre for the foreseeable future ... we're thinking [falls are] more a story for early 2024.\" — Reporting by political reporter Evelyn Manfield",
