Johnston lived in Gaza for a number of years as well as reporting on the conflict. She says Ms Albanese's address was \"the kind of address we don't here in Australia very often\". Johnston says this is the first time she's heard the international community discuss international law to this extent. \"Part of the reason for that, of course, is the extraordinary number of Palestinians killed according to the Palestinian health officials as we just heard,\" she says. \"The issue of proportionality and international law has become incredibly important.\" Johnston also believes one of the reasons journalists are struggling to verify information is because Israel has closed the borders into Gaza. \"Israel is not allowing journalists to be in Gaza and report on this conflict,\" she says. \"It is also, of course, a war of propaganda on both sides. \"For example, the number of people killed has been a really interesting one. \"We had the US and Israel come out, cast doubt on the numbers that were coming out of the Hamas-controlled health ministry. \"We had Human Rights Watch and other international organisations come out and say in previous wars the numbers have been on track.\"",

              "plaintext": "Iron ore spot prices rose to nearly $US130 per tonne on Friday, its highest level since March. Analysts say the price increase is due to hopes that China’s property sector (35‑40% of the Middle Kingdom's steel demand) is stabilising. They also say the prospect for additional infrastructure investment in China (which comprises 20‑25% of its steel demand) is driving up prices. Here's an excerpt from the latest note by Commonwealth Bank commodities analyst Vivek Dhar: \"The trajectory of China’s property sector remains one of the key uncertainties facing the iron ore market. Medium and long‑term loans to households in China, a proxy for mortgages, slowed noticeably last month from September. \"To put the increase in the mortgage proxy in context, the October result was the seventh lowest monthly increase in the last decade. \"Much of the hope for the stabilisation of China’s property sector is tied to measures being put in place to boost activity. For example, 16 major Chinese cities have removed maximum price limits on land auctions. \"Support for China’s embattled property developers likely remains at the heart of any sustainable stabilisation of the property sector. \"The challenge for China’s government though is achieving stabilisation for property developers. But with homebuyer confidence so dented and new home prices falling from June to September, it’s hard to see how the government can stabilise the property sector without more direct and active involvement. \"And the most relevant data for steel and iron ore markets is property developer confidence to build new projects. After falling ~39%/yr in 2022, China’s new home starts, in square metres, has declined ~24% in the first 9 months of 2023. \"It’s hard to see how new home starts can turn around in the short term. We’ll get an update on the state of China’s property sector when activity and investment data is released tomorrow for October.\"",

              "plaintext": "Commonwealth Bank's home loan book slumped $4.5 billion in the September quarter as it shied away from cut-throat competition. But the nation's biggest lender said its margins had stabilised, which helped to send its shares higher on Tuesday. The update from the bank (which makes up a quarter of Australia's $2 trillion mortgage market) suggests a strategic change is paying off. CBA was the first among Australia's major banks to stop luring borrowers with cash handouts and what it called uneconomic lending rates. The bank also said its \"margin compresion\" has stopped. Earnings reports from Australia's other \"big four\" banks Westpac, NAB and ANZ showed narrowing margins in recent months as interest rate hikes since May last year spurred a rush of refinancing. CBA said cash profit was $2.5 billion for the quarter (which was 3% better than a consensus estimate for the period, according to data aggregator Visible Alpha). CBA's shrinking mortgage book \"reflects a disciplined approach to pricing which ensures marginal shareholder returns remain above the cost of capital in a highly competitive market\", the bank said in its limited first-quarter update. \"Home lending margins stabilised in the quarter,\" it added, without giving figures. Shares of CBA were up 0.8% to $102.08, by 3:30pm AEDT, as analysts welcomed the better-than-expected margin outcome and a smaller-than-expected provision for potential loan impairments. \"With many trends similar to peers, we think the market will take the slightly better NIM [net interest margin] outcome well,\" said Citi analyst Brendan Sproules in a client note. Commenting on the bank's stabilising home loan margins, E & P Financial analyst Azib Khan said that \"it would be helping on this front that CBA has been willing to forgo market share\". For the year to September, CBA said it grew its mortgage book at 0.7 times the rate of the overall mortgage industry.",
