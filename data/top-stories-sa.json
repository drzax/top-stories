Hey Tim, We can't provide you advice on what the best course of action is to take with your mortgage — we aren't licensed to do so (it's also why we have that little disclaimer at the top of the blog). That said, there are thousands of home owners who are coming off their fixed rate and are bracing for the impact of these higher rates. A couple of months ago our colleague Stephanie Chalmers pulled together this handy guide if you're already struggling with mortgage repayments. But if you're trying to get ahead of the curve, we've also got you covered. Emily Stewart asked the experts this very question last year, and pulled together this quick guide to help you prepare — and who to ask for advice. I've linked it below for you to have a read of (or you can bookmark it for another day).",
