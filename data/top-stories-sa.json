CreditorWatch chief economist Anneke Thompson spoke to my colleague Alicia Barry on the ABC News Channel. \"I am in the camp that interest rates have peaked.\" \"There would have to be something quite surprising and shocking movement in inflation from here for them to go any higher. \" She sees rates on hold until next year because of high services inflation like the cost of rent and insurance. \"I think the earliest we might see interest rates declining maybe mid next year and that is because the services inflation side is still too high.\" Ms Thompson says higher interest rates are hurting younger households in particular. \"The interest rate rises have definitely hit the consumer.\" \"Not just mortgage holders but renters as well, that younger aged cohort, 25 to 18 year-olds, and 25 to 34 year-olds who are feeling the pinch.\" \"It is a consumer recession out there but hitting different generations at different ways.\" And CreditorWatch is seeing the average size of company invoices declining and trade payment defaults rising slowly. Ms Thompson says that means more businesses going under. \"Which means there are certain suppliers out there and customers who cannot pay their bills on time, and when we see that data starting to rise we know that business failure rates are going to rise 6 to 12 months down the track.\"",
