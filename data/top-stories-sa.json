They continue to warn that geopolitical events risk overtaking, and overwhelming, financial ones. \"Even the Federal Reserve now warns of growing geopolitical risks to the global financial system,\" they note. \"And if they are finally prepared to talk about it, markets should be concerned. \"This is going to be a very tense week. And, sadly, it's hard to see a realistic off-ramp. \"The confluence of risks in the Middle East threatens a geopolitical chain reaction that has the potential to make monetary reactions look like small beer by comparison.\" Not that there aren't some potentially worrying financial developments either. Japanese inflation finally looks to be escaping the doldrums, prompting noises that the Bank of Japan will gradually edge further away from its aggressive policies to keep interest rates ultra low. \"Evaporating monetary easing from the Bank of Japan comes at a delicate moment,\" they observe. \"The USA is running colossal deficits to finance their guns and butter spending, China is selling Treasuries to defend the CNY, and Argentina *could* be poised to elect a Libertarian President who has promised to dollarise the economy. \" The threat of a global liquidity squeeze raises questions for markets where fragilities have already been exposed by the UK pension blowup and the mini banking crisis in the USA and Switzerland. \"A scramble for cash is underway, which probably means that somebody is going to miss out. \"What does that mean for emerging markets that the USA needs to keep in the geopolitical tent? \"If the BOJ retracts the control rod of yield curve control from the monetary reactor core, will this set off a chain reaction in bond markets that will break something else?\" You can listen to more of what Michael Every has to say when he speaks with Kirsten Aiken by tuning into The Business on ABC News channel at 8:45pm AEDT or watching back on iView.",

But one stock defying the recent gloom is Weebit Nano, which develops \"advanced semiconductor memory technology\". It's the ASX 200's top gainer by far today up 16.2% to $4.37, and has gained around 50% over the past four trading sessions. It all began with a 6.9% jump to $3.11 on Wednesday, a day before it put out a market update pre-open on Thursday morning announcing a major deal for South Korean foundry DB HiTek to licence its technology on chips. It then rose a further 6.8% on Thursday and 13.3% on Friday. Based in Israel and France, the company had previously updated the market on October 10 to assure investors that its operations would be unaffected by the Israel-Gaza war, with its lab currently unaffected and work-from-home contingency plans in place for its Israeli staff if needed. The other biggest gains as of the middle of the trading day are: ARB Corporation +4% to $31.46 Insignia Financial +2.7% to $2.095 Resmed +2.4% to $23.18 Fisher and Paykel Healthcare +1.9% to $19.29 The biggest losers (amongst many) are: New Hope Corporation -9% to $5.89 Pilbara Minerals -5.2% to $3.66 Mineral Resources -4.1% to $57.13 Alumina Ltd -4% to $0.7775 Coronado Global Resources -3.9% to $1.62 Overall, only a quarter of the ASX 200 companies were gaining ground, with 144 in the red and six flat. Healthcare (+1%) and consumer non-cyclicals (+0.4%) were the only sectors in the black. Energy (-2.4%) was down sharply, led by coal miners, while mining (-1.9%) and education (-1%) were also off steeply.",
