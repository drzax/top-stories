This is not the first time the airport has been hit. Two days ago, Syria's state media reported Israeli forces had launched \"simultaneous\" missile strikes on two main airports in Aleppo and Damascus. The attack damaged both runways and put both hubs out of service. The strikes on the airports are intended to disrupt Iranian supply lines to Syria, a source told Reuters. The Israeli military has not commented on the strikes, but earlier said that two rockets had been launched from Syria toward Israeli territory that \"fell in an open area\". \"No interceptors were activated according to protocol,\" the IDF said of that incident.",
