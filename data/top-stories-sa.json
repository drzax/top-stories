In the meantime, here are some other key questions that will be useful today, writes to economist Conrad Liveris: What is the unemployment rate in WA? The current unemployment rate in WA is 3.6 per cent. Unemployment means the rate of people currently looking for work. The underemployment rate is 5.7 per cent. Underemployment is the rate of people who are looking for work and want more hours. The WA unemployment rate hasn't been above 4 per cent in more than 18 months. Anything below 5 per cent is considered low unemployment, and a market that favours workers. This matters for the budget because so many projects rely on people working on them. Governments can announce new schools or expansions of hospitals, but if they don't have enough people able to work then they will struggle to operate them. What is the inflation rate? Inflation in Perth is at 5.8 per cent. That's a fair bit lower than the national rate of 7 per cent but still concerning. The Reserve Bank has a target inflation rate of 2-3 per cent, so we are double where they want it and it’s the reason they have spent the past year putting up interest rates. Governments are conscious of inflation because it makes it harder for people to cover the cost of living. The high inflation we have at the moment is being driven by essentials for running our lives — things like food, housing and utilities — which are going up faster than the things we can live without, the discretionary items.",

The economic modelling, conducted by a senior analyst in the bank's Economic Analysis Department, defined a recession as unemployment increasing by 0.75 of a percentage point over a 12 month period. Conventional models put the risk of this happening at around 50 per cent. However, the analyst believed those models underestimated the risk. Using a different methodology, they found the risk of a recession was between 65-80 per cent over the next two years. The research was conducted in September 2022, just days before the bank slowed the pace of its interest rate rises from 0.5 of a percentage point per meeting to 0.25 of a percentage point.
