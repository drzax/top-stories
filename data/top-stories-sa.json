There are so many factors feeding into the awareness and understanding of Vladimir Putin's war inside his own country. And of course much of that is by his design. Yes, there is a propaganda machine at work that is not reporting death tolls widely or accurately, but there are other dynamics too. Earlier in the year, Western officials said it was likely 200,000 Russians had been injured or killed in the war, with at least 40,000 killed. At the time, the analysis was that Vladimir Putin's support could probably sustain that. And when the partial mobilisation happened in September, we learnt that it targeted ethnic minorities in disadvantaged regions - hardly the centres of the President's power base. So while some Russians are likely oblivious, I don't think that can be said for everyone. I think there are some regions and communities disproportionately impacted who will have buried many of their sons. But in Moscow and St Petersburg, I think there is more tolerance for the deaths because they appear as a number on a page. I wrote about the communities impacted by the mobilisation last year:",

The strongest private army and loudest critic of the Kremlin were eliminated, didn’t it play out like Putin would have hoped a potential coup might go? - Marc Hi Marc, thanks for writing in. I've put your question to military strategist Mick Ryan, who writes: The coup ultimately has not made Putin stronger. While it might have removed Wagner as a threat (for now) the weekend was not about overthrowing Putin but more about a cry for help from Prigozhin. That said, the slow reaction of Putin and the security authorities has damaged Putin’s standing and revealed what many Russian experts have been describing for some time as a brittleness in the Russian system. For a far better analysis than I could ever provide, I recommend Peter Tesch’s latest article at the ASPI Strategist. Peter has been, and remains, a superb servant of our nation, was our ambassador to Moscow, and is a very deep and broad expert on Russia issues.",

I've put it to our global affairs editor John Lyons, who writes: Hello Rafski - you're right to raise Poland. Poland is so heavily invested in what happens in Ukraine for many reasons. I don't think Wagner is a particular threat to Poland. I think the real threat to Poland is Russia's general aggression. One thing that really struck me being in Ukraine and Poland recently is how crowded the highway from Poland is with tanks and other military hardware.

The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry says the retreat in inflation will bring some comfort to small business. ACCI chief of policy and advocacy David Alexander: “After experiencing 12 interest rate increases, declining consumer spending, and a surge in input costs, it’s good news for small businesses that inflation is returning to its downward trend.\" “Many small businesses are seeing their costs rise to the point where they have no choice but to increase their prices to maintain operations.\" Australian Industry Group chief executive Innes Willox says the drop in inflation is encouraging, but more rate hikes will likely be needed. \"While encouraging for both households and businesses and bearing in mind that the monthly ABS excludes some items, we are not there yet. \" \"Sticking on the path to target inflation will require continued restraint in price setting and wage negotiations by businesses, governments and employees.\" \"With GDP growth of just 0.2 per cent in the March quarter, there is very little scope for further slowing without tipping the economy into contraction.\"",

Just confirming that is the logic here? - Tim. Hi Tim, You're one of a few keen commenters who have pointed this out. It sounds counterintuitive but you're right — that is exactly the logic here. RBA governor Philip Lowe told a Senate Estimates hearing in Canberra last month that higher interest rates would help alleviate some rental pressures in the short term because it would force people to \"economise\" on their housing — which translates to either living at home for longer, or getting housemates. Here's what he said: \"The way that this ends up fixing itself, unfortunately, is through higher housing prices and higher rents. \"Because as rents go up people decide not to move out of home, or you don't have that home office, you [get] a flatmate. \"The increase in supply can't happen immediately, but higher prices do lead people to economise on housing. \"That's the price mechanism at work. We need more people on average to live in each dwelling, and prices do that.\" Rents make up a solid chunk of the consumer price index (in fact, Mr Lowe says they're the \"single largest\" component) and expects rents will remain high for some time. Of course, long term we need to see an increase in housing supply — which Mr Lowe also acknowledged during Estimates. You can read the full story about Mr Lowe's justification for higher rents by my colleagues Gareth Hutchens and Rhiana Whitson below:",
