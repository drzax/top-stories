Developer and landlord Mirvac has swung to a $165 million loss in financial year 2023, down from a $906 million profit the year before. The loss has been driven by write-downs in the value of its office (-5.6 per cent ) and retail (-5.3 per cent ) property portfolios, partly offset by a +6.2 per cent revaluation of its industrial properties. The company also sold off about $500 million of \"non-core\" assets at a 2 per cent discount to their book values, excluding the cost of the sales. Mirvac said it would continue to increase its exposure to residential and industrial real estate, while reducing the share of office space on its books, as the persistence of working from home dents demand in that sector. Excluding one-off costs, the company's \"operating profit\" dropped 3 per cent to $580 million. It will pay a 5.3 cent per share final dividend .",

A review by ASIC has found that general insurers can, and should, improve their claims handling processes and dedicate more resources, after identifying a number of weaknesses. \"An insurance claim doesn’t have to be handled perfectly, but it must be handled well,\" ASIC deputy chair Karen Chester said. \"Our claims handling review found good practices and poor practices across all six insurers. \"We identified five areas where insurers can and should make immediate claims handling improvements — consumer communications, project management, identifying vulnerable consumers and complaints, resourcing of claims and complaints handling.\" The report was based on data from more than 200,000 claims lodged in the first three months of last year. Insurers included in the review included Suncorp, AAMI, Allianz, Budget Direct, QBE, IAG and Youi. Consumer advocates have welcomed the findings. \"The insurance process can be stressful, especially in the wake of the extreme weather events that are happening more often, and I am delighted ASIC is telling insurers they must lift their game especially for people who are vulnerable,\" Consumer Action Law Centre managing lawyer Philippa Heir said.
