Analysts said while the extended policy could ease the short-term financial pressure on property developers and ensure their home project completions, new measures would be needed to tackle the cash crunch in the sector. The sector has been hit by many company defaults amid a debt crisis since mid-2021, triggered by non-repayments of China Evergrande Group 3333.HK, the world's most indebted property developer. The central bank on Monday said it would give developers an extra 12 months to repay loans due this year, with many private firms still struggling to access new capital despite policymakers' aggressive support measures. Markets expect more stimulus to be rolled out soon. Last November, the People's Bank of China (PBOC) put in place 16 measures to support the cash-strapped sector, including loan repayment extensions, to ease a deepening liquidity crisis. On Monday, the PBOC said it would allow loans due this year to be repaid before the end of 2024. Separately, it said the risk classifications of loans issued to support the delivery of unfinished projects before the end of 2024 will not be downgraded during their loan terms. Financial firm Nomura said the \"band-aid-style\" policy support on Monday is unlikely to revive property sales, which have been weak for months, as it does little to restore home buyers' confidence. By 3:30pm AEST, the Hang Seng index had jumped 1.3% to 18,725 points, while the Shanghai Composite was up 0.3% to 3,214. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Mainland Properties Index gained 1.8%. Sunac China, Logan Group and KWG Group, listed in Hong Kong were, among the top gainers, rising 4 - 5%. - Reuters",

The spot price for the steelmaking material (62% iron) dropped to just over $US105 / tonne, its lowest level since June 1. Here's what Commonwealth Bank commodities analyst Vivek Dhar wrote in his latest note to clients: \"The demand concerns in China were highlighted by Rio Tinto’s chairman Dominic Barton, when he noted ‘there is a big real estate issue” in China. His comments underscore a deteriorating property sector that accounts for 35 - 40% of China’s steel demand. \"A number of property related indicators have turned south. New home price growth has begun to slow after peaking in March 2023. Property investment and property sales (in square metres) has started to contract sharply, falling 22%/yr and 20%/yr respectively in May. \"The most relevant indicator for steel demand and therefore the most important for iron ore prices is the drop off in China’s newly constructed floor space. \"This reflects the start of the construction process and where steel is mostly used. After dropping ~39%/yr in 2022, China’s newly constructed floor space has declined another ~23%/yr in the first five months of 2023.\" He also said the surprise slowdown in China’s consumer price index (CPI) to 0% in June highlights broader concerns for China’s economy: \"These concerns only increase the likelihood of policy support. And with Politburo’s semi annual economic conference due later this month, we expect policymakers will announce some support for the Chinese economy. \"The composition of the policy support will be crucial. Our expectation is that any policy support will be limited, particularly with China only targeting economic growth of 5% this year after growing only 3% in 2022. \"Since the early 1970s, China’s economy has lifted at least 7.5% after growing 3% or less the preceding year. \"Solving the issues of the property sector will be tricky given confidence and demand are so subdued following the fallout from property developer defaults and falling new home prices through 2022. \"As a result we think any support for the property sector will need to be longer and stronger than previous policies. Any stabilisation will therefore be more realistically realised next year.\"",
