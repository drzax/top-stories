Reuters reported the barrage of rockets served as cover for an unprecedented multi-pronged infiltration of fighters. Most fighters crossed through breaches in land barriers separating Gaza and Israel. They attacked towns near the border, walked onto military bases and reaching into Israel as far as Ofakim, which is 30 kilometres inside the country. Israel has spent hundreds of millions fortifying the border wall between itself and Gaza, announcing in 2021 a smart system, that included sensors, had been completed. It was believed to sit inside the existing steel fence to create a border or buffer zone. Questions are now being asked as to how all these systems failed and communities near the Gaza border were left with very little defences as Hamas invaded.",

Currently, the Israel military is working to rescue hostages while Gaza prepares for further strikes as retaliation against Hamas. Here is a summary of what's happened so far: Hamas launched an air, sea and land attack on Israel on Saturday morning (local time), where a reported 200 Israelis were initially killed Israel was caught off-guard and Hamas militants reportedly attacked towns and communities near the Gaza border for hours before a defence was mounted Israeli then hit back, trying to regain communities from Hamas and launching airstrikes towards Gaza. These intensified overnight, with several residential buildings hit and destroyed A Hamas rocket barrage into central Israel hit four cities, including Tel Aviv An Israeli army spokesman says fighting is continuing in 22 locations in southern Israel after the initial attack and the situation is not yet under control Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke in a televised address declaring: \"We are at war\" The Hamas militant group says it is holding “dozens” of Israeli soldiers captive in Gaza There are fears for civilian kidnapping victims too, with Israeli military trying to free hostages that are believed to still be in Israel. Some have been taken across the border into Gaza Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh warned the assault that had begun in Gaza would spread to the West Bank and Jerusalem US Secretary of State Antony Blinken urged the Palestinian Authority to restore calm and stability in the West Bank in a call with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas on Saturday, according to the US State Department Prime Minister Anthony Albanese condemned the attack on Israel, saying it had a right to defend itself Israel said it would stop supplying electricity, fuel and goods to Gaza Israeli defence chiefs are facing growing questions over how the disaster could have happened",
