Investors are closely watching the developments in the Middle East after Israeli aircraft struck southern Lebanon and Israeli troops and Palestinians clashed in the occupied West Bank. Market participants are also awaiting a slew of data from the United States later in the week, including third-quarter gross domestic product numbers and personal consumption expenditures report, to assess the economic strength of the country. Back home, financial stocks rose 0.2 per cent. Mining stocks gained 0.1 per cent after a three-day slide. BHP and Rio Tinto climbed 0.1 per cent and 0.4 per cent, respectively. Energy stocks jumped 0.3 per cent, with Woodside Energy and Santos rising 0.1 per cent and 0.7 per cent, respectively. Technology stocks lost 0.1 per cent after four consecutive sessions of losses. Gold stocks fell 0.7 per cent, heading for their worst day since Oct. 3. Shares of Northern Star Resources rose 0.1 per cent. Among individual stocks, shares of Zip advanced more than 11 per cent after the buy-now-pay-later (BNPL) firm returned to profitability in the first quarter of fiscal 2024, earlier than previously projected. Shares of Core Lithium and Pilbara Minerals climbed 3.8 per cent and 3.9 per cent, respectively, to be among the top gainers in the benchmark index.",
