Mr Speirs urged people to \"remain respectful and decent\" during the voting process. \"This is an important part of democracy and we ought to respect it and respect each other's views,\" he said. Mr Speirs said South Australians he had spoken to were \"confused\" about the Voice. \"They're really concerned about the serious lack of detail that has been put on the table by the prime minister. And the prime minister is going to have a lot of questions to answer on Sunday morning if, as predicted, the referendum is defeated across Australia,\" he said. Ms Liddle, an Arrernte woman, said people should focus on the facts when they make their decision, not emotion. \"It is about a whole new chapter in our constitution, in our nation's rulebook, and anything you do to our rulebook has consequences,\" she said. \"That's why Australians have been very careful historically in making any change to our rulebook — and they should be. \"And they should be really careful on this one too, because they shouldn't be voting on emotion. \"They shouldn't be voting because they feel like they're being intimidated, harassed, or ashamed or guilted. None of those things should come into play here.\"",

The group says the move is an attack on their right to demonstrate in solidarity with the people of Palestine, and it is important for them to express their views in the wake of the international community failing to intervene over the loss of human life in Gaza. Josh Lees from the Palestine Action Group says he believes the government wants to crack down on pro-Palestine protests because of \"Israel's plan to unleash atrocities on Gaza\". \"Mr Netanyahu himself said that we're only getting started. The Israeli defence minister called the Palestinian people animals and openly talked about carrying out a basic genocide in Gaza and our governments in the West are giving them carte blanche rearming them, like the United States announced this morning,\" he said. \"Our governments are complicit in the crimes that are about to be unleashed on the people of Gaza. That's why it is more important than ever the people come out to protest … This is a genocide we're talking about, that they will unleash on the people of Gaza, we have to keep protesting against that.\" Peter Slezak from Independent Jewish Voices says attempts to smear these rallies as anti-Semitic are wrong. \"I'm proud to stand as many Jews on behalf of the people who stand up for human rights and for international law to condemn what the state of Israel is doing with the complicity and the help of our own governments and the big powers around the world,\" he says.",

There is no player in this draft as skilful as Nick Watson. He kicks goals most players couldn't dream of pulling off. He's a small forward who works hand all over the ground, and has had proven impact as a pinch-hitting midfielder. Sounds pretty good, right? What's the downside? The knock on Watson is he is 170cm tall. That makes him shorter than Caleb Daniel. But as Daniel, Brent Harvey and so many others have proven over the journey, height matters little when your football talent is immense enough. And in Watson's case, it certainly is. Concerns over his height won't be enough to deter clubs from making him a top-10 pick, but it might be enough to spook clubs right up the very top end. What is certain is that whoever picks him up is going to be treated to plenty of highlights, and one set of fans is going to have a new cult hero to love.",

From all reports, the Hawks are a bit surprised by this as well and haven't exactly been preparing for it. If Hawthorn are interested in bringing him back, I can't see them offering a whole lot to make it happen. Last year the Lions payed pick 48 and a future fourth for him. I doubt the Hawks will even go that far this time around. Whether that means Gunston stays in Brisbane or if another Victorian club tries to get involved remains to be seen.",

As you will see, Wall Street ended in the red and the futures for Australian markets show we will likely follow. The CPI data shows that price hikes aren't over in the world's biggest economy, with headline rising above consensus estimates by 0.3% a month and core inflation about the same. That, of course, is creating concern that the US federal reserve will raise rates again to tackle price spikes. This note from CBA this morning: Notwithstanding, we doubt the downtrend in inflation has been thrown off course.  The outlook for the US consumer is poor given the resumption of student loan repayments, lower government benefit payments, and the erosion of pandemic savings.  At the same time, interest rates on consumer loans have risen sharply to very high levels.  Indeed, some FOMC officials have recently said the rise in yields may substitute for further FOMC tightening.  Our baseline remains for the FOMC to keep the Funds rate steady into early 2024.  We consider the FOMC’s significant policy tightening will lead the global economy into recession. Recession fears are also being sparked by the devastating crisis in the Middle East. Here is a piece by our business reporter Nassim Khadem to get you started this morning.",
