The three-month period from June through August surpassed previous records by a large margin, with an average temperature of 16.8 degrees Celsius (62.2F) — 0.66C above average. Last month was the also the hottest August on record globally, the third straight month in a row to set such a record following the hottest ever June and July, the EU said on Wednesday. \"Global temperature records continue to tumble in 2023,\" Copernicus deputy head Samantha Burgess said. \"The scientific evidence is overwhelming, we will continue to see more climate records and more intense and frequent extreme weather events impacting society and ecosystems, until we stop emitting greenhouse gases,\" Burgess said.",

              "plaintext": "ASIC, the Australian financial regulator, has launched legal action against PayPal Australia over allegedly unfair business contract terms. The proceedings allege PayPal Australia's contracts with small business customers contained an \"unfair\" term that gave business account holders 60 days to notify PayPal of any errors or discrepancies in fees they had been charged, or accept them as accurate. \"ASIC alleges the term is unfair because the effect of the term is to permit PayPal to retain fees it has overcharged or wrongly charged if the small business does not notify PayPal of the error within 60 days of the fee appearing in its account statement,\" the watchdog's statement said. ASIC's deputy chair Sarah Court said the legal action was about protecting the interests of small businesses. \"We allege this term is unfair because it allows PayPal to escape the consequences of its own errors in overcharging small businesses, and places additional burdens on small businesses to detect and correct charging errors,\" she said. PayPal Australia has been contacted for comment.",

              "plaintext": "Good morning and welcome to Thursday, September 7 — and the ABC's markets and business blog. Let's start in the US, where Wall Street finished lower overnight after stronger than expected economic data stoked fresh inflation and interest rate concerns. The data in question was from the services sector, with the Institute for Supply Management seeing its non-manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index lifting to 54.5 last month — a six-month high, and slightly higher than the 52.2 expected Coupled with prices paid by service-sector businesses for inputs increasing, that has investors nervous that interest rates will remain higher. Traders are still broadly expecting the US Federal Reserve to keep rates on hold when it meets this month, but their bets on a pause in November fell below 47% — a tumble from the previous bet of 57%, according to CME Group's FedWatch Tool. This concern has also delayed expectations for interest rate cuts happening sooner rather than later. Chief investment officer at BMO, Carol Schleif, said the data showed a strong economy and inflation not coming down \"as fast as the Fed would need to start cutting rates any time in the foreseeable future \". That's also followed comments made earlier in the day by the Boston Fed's President Susan Collins, who remarked the US central bank needed to \"proceed carefully\" with its next steps in monetary policy. So, where does that leave us here in Australia? Well, according to the futures market, a weaker start on the ASX, for one. We can also expect the market to be sensitive to more interest rate and inflation thinking coming out of our own central bank today. RBA governor Philip Lowe is making what is widely expected to be his last public speech in the top job this afternoon at a lunch in Sydney, before he hands over to Michele Bullock at the end of next week. Still with me? Great — grab a coffee, settle in, and let's get this show on the road as we rapidly approach the weekend.",
