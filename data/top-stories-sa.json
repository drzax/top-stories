AMP fell 6.1 per cent as it faces a big compensation bill after former AMP financial advisers won a case against the investment house. Treasury Wine (-0.4 per cent) announced it would close its Karadoc winery in Victoria next year because of higher costs and lower sales. Bega Cheese rose 3.4 per cent today after taking a hit last month amid higher milk prices because of smaller herds and labour shortages on farms. Asian shares were also weaker amid tensions between China and the US after Beijing restricted exports of two chip making materials.

The credit ratings agency says high interest rates and inflation will continue to push up mortgage delinquencies over the next 12 months. Analysts Helen Liu and Alena Chen say most at risk are borrowers who took out mortgages at very low interest rates. This includes the hundreds of thousands of borrowers on low fixed rate loans, who are facing much higher rates when their fixed term ends over the next year. Nearly half of home loans were fixed term by July 2021, compared to one fifth before 2020. Moody's says 1.26 per cent of home loans were at least 30 days in arrears over March, up from 1.05 per cent in December. But 4.04 per cent of riskier loans were behind in repayments in March. \"The combination of high interest rates and inflation will continue to weaken mortgage borrowers' abilities to pay monthly home loan instalments,\" they said. \"The fixed-rate period for a large number of mortgages will end over the next 6-12 months, which will add to home loan delinquencies.\" \"However, Australia's unemployment rate is low (3.6 per cent in May), so we expect mortgage delinquencies will only rise moderately.\"",

              "plaintext": "Wyloo Metals, which is owned by mining billionaire Andrew Forrest, is set to buy nickel miner Mincor Resources. The $750 million takeover will turn Wyloo into a major nickel producer with Mincor's Cassini nickel sulphide deposit in Kambalda in Western Australia's goldfields region. Wyloo now owns more than 90 per cent of Mincor, allowing it to buy the rest of the firm's shares. Nickel is used in the production of batteries for electric vehicles. Wyloo is looking at building a $1 billion battery materials processing plant with nickel miner IGO in Kwinana, south west of Perth. It's the latest acquisition in the renewable energy space for Mr Forrest. “Wyloo has targeted nickel sulphides as they are the greenest and cheapest option for battery manufacturing: they have the best economics, can be processed into battery grade nickel with the lowest environmental footprint and are fully recyclable,” Mr Forrest said. Wyloo chief executive Luca Giacovazzi said the company was also looking to increase spending on exploration in the Kambalda region. “The acquisition of Mincor turns Wyloo into a fully integrated nickel business that brings together high-grade nickel production from Kambalda with our planned downstream processing facility in Kwinana,” he said. “By adding Mincor to our portfolio, we’ve introduced a producing mine alongside our long-life development projects, with all our ore bodies located in the tier one jurisdictions of Australia and Canada.” Australia is seeking to build a critical minerals processing industry.",
