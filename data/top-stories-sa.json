While prices are still below last year's highs, which were well above $US100 a barrel after Russia invaded Ukraine, the higher cost of fuel is weighing on household budgets and contributing to inflation. The main reason for the price rises is that the oil producers cartel, OPEC, has limited production to bolster prices because they are worried about the slowing global economy reducing demand for fuel. Saudi Arabia and Russia, the two biggest producers in the OPEC+ group have extended their production cuts, and that's got investors worried about a supply deficit over the last quarter of the year.

Weaker iron ore prices are weighing on the big miners, and big banks are weaker ahead of this week's meeting by the US Federal Reserve. The Fed is expected to keep interest rates on hold. The ASX 200 index is down 0.4 per cent in afternoon trade. Explosives maker Orica (+1.5 per cent) is higher after it announced higher pollution reduction targets at its Sustainability Investor Day. These include: an increased target to reduce direct carbon emissions (Scope 1 & 2) by at least 45 per cent by 2030 from 2019 levels a new short term target to reduce direct emissions by 30 per cent by 2026 from 2019 levels a new ambition to reduce customer and supply chain emissions (Scope 3) by 25 per cent by 2035 from 2022 baseline levels. Orica also confirmed its profit predictions for the full year. Takeover target Newcrest Mining (+1.5 per cent) gained after the world's biggest gold miner Newmont Mining got the green light from the Foreign Investment Review Board to buy the local gold producer for $26.2 billion. More regulatory approvals are required including a vote by shareholders. Logistics company Qube (-1 per cent) fell after reporting the death of a worker following at incident at its forestry harvesting operations in South Australia. SafeWork SA and the state police are investigating.",

The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry-Westpac Survey of Industrial Trends. Australia's longest running business survey, remained at low levels over the third quarter, just above 50 points, which is the break even mark. Westpac says manufacturers are facing the weakest demand (outside of the pandemic) in a decade, and declining profitability. The survey of firms found new orders were flat for a second quarter, and employment and overtime fell. In fact, new orders, which are a key sign of health for a business because they indicate current demand, are the weakest for the half year since 2013. \"The key message and the number one concern of manufacturers is the lack of any growth in new orders.\" \"Back-to-back flat new orders (with only a net 1 per cent reporting a rise for both June and September quarters) is consistent with the marked slowing of the Australian economy.\" \"The economic downturn is centred on consumer spending, which was flat in the June quarter, as household real disposable income contracted for a fifth consecutive quarter, squeezed by rising living costs, higher interest rates, and additional tax obligations.\" The survey found the general business mood remains deeply pessimistic. More than one third of respondents expect the general business situation to worsen over the next six months, little changed from the previous quarter. So looks like AMP's Diana Mousina could be right when she says 50:50 chance of a recession. On the upside, Westpac says production rose modestly helped by an easing of worker and material shortages. And it thinks the survey suggests that the RBA is on hold from here. \"Inflation pressures have eased the survey finds, which along with the soft demand backdrop, adds to the case for the RBA remaining on hold and suggest that official interest rates have likely peaked.\"",
