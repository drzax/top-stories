He said the RBA's May statement on monetary policy showed the central bank was forecasting headline inflation falling to 6.25%, and trimmed mean inflation falling to 6% — which would represent a \"substantial decline\" from current rates. Inflation figures in that ballpark would be enough for them to hold off on raising interest rates at next week's meeting, he said. \"I think you'd need to see at least that for them to hold off,\" Mr Bassanese said. \" Anything higher, I think they'll raise rates, but I'm hopeful that we actually get numbers better than that, that inflation, both true mean and headline can actually drop to drop to maybe 5.8%, 5.9%, and that would be enough I think for them to hold off.\" But taking all things into account, Mr Bassanese still expects two more rate rises by the end of the year. \"I've got two more rate rises to come. I actually think, end of the day, demand is going to remain,\" he said. \"We've seen some softening in consumer spending, but I just think labour market and spending ... and in fact, a decline in inflation can sort of boost real incomes a little bit, so I think we're going to see some resilience in the consumer sector and the housing market seems to be bouncing back. \"So I think the RBA is probably going to raise rates twice more by year end, but maybe hold off this month if the CPI is OK. \"We'll see, but that's my view.\"",

Core or underlying inflation strips out volatile items like fruit, vegetables and petrol. While headline prices are coming down, core inflation came in at 6.4 per cent over the year to May according to the Bureau of Statistics. That was a tiny decline from the 6.5 per cent over the year to April. Core inflation remains high because of strong services inflation including rent and energy prices. The market is expecting one of the measures of core inflation, the Trimmed Mean CPI, to rise by 1.1 per cent over the June quarter and by 6 per cent over the year to June, which would be a pull back from the 6.6 per cent annual rate over the March quarter. National Australia Bank says that would be in line with the RBA's latest economic forecasts. However NAB's head of foreign exchange strategy Ray Attrill warns: \"We are fearful that the underlying details on services dominated by wages, rent and energy - which we expect to show no signs of moderation - could reduce the RBA's confidence in CPI falling back to the top of the target band (3 per cent) in a reasonable time frame.\" \"Hence we see the need for further RBA tightening, including next week if this is indeed the message from today's figures.\"",
