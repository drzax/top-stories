It is a different feeling on the ground. I have been leafleting and train stations and I have been door knocking and phone banking for a long time,\" he says. \"There is a different story out there and I hope that comes to a happy conclusion, where we recognise Indigenous people as we should have done long ago and we enshrine the ability for us to be heard. \"That is the key to closing the gap in life expectancy which in remote communities is something like 20 years difference, broadly it is around eight years, but we need to do better and I think that a yes vote gives us that opportunity. A no vote is just more of the same.\" When asked how many Australians are undecided and will potentially make their decisions at the polling booths, Mr Mayo says \"it is around 30 per cent and that is matched by our experience on the doors and in the phone banking\". \"These final conversations in these last eight days are going to be vital.\" Mr Mayo says SA and Tasmania are swing states to focus on, but it is important to think about all Australians. \"As a campaign, we have made sure that we are spreading the word about what a hopeful and important step this will be for our nation. We are hoping that we can get six out of six.\"",

It's all because the fund manager reported a $4 billion drop in funds under management as of September, down to $35 billion. Investors clearly are not happy. PEXA Group has also been in the red, down by -5.5%. Macquarie has cut its price target for the digital property settlements platform because of its acquisition of UK-based Smoove. The brokerage says the deal lacks execution details and that Smoove is a loss making business. When it comes to the sectors: energy and healthcare are leading the losses (-0.5% and -0.3% respectively). The sectors doing well today are academic and education services (+0.5%), financials (+0.3%) and industrials (+0.3%). Let's take a look at the top movers : QBE Insurance (+2.3%) Iress Ltd (+2%) Telix Pharmaceuticals (+1.8%) Block Inc (+1.8%) Aristocrat Leisure (+1.7%) The bottom movers are: Magellan Financial Group (-12.7%) PEXA Group (-5.5%) IGO Ltd (-3.1%) Core Lithium (-2.7%) Neuren Pharmaceuticals (-2.5%)",

Here are the key findings: It says higher inflation and interest rates continue to put pressure on household budgets, however, most borrowers are coping with the higher costs. Lower income households spend a larger share of their income on housing and essential items, therefore they are the most impacted by inflation. Home owners with variable rate mortgages have seen their payments increase by up to 50%, but the vast majority of borrowers have continued to service their debts. Borrowers who fixed their interest rates at record low rates (accounting for about 1/5 of housing credit) will roll of onto higher rates over the rest of this year (you know, the mortgage cliff!) however the bank says they don't appear to be at more risk than other borrowers, since they've benefited from an extended period of low rates. A small, but rising share of borrowers are in the early stages of financial stress. There's only been a slight deterioration in the banks' credit quality (because borrowers are mostly able to service their debts) And the banks are well placed to handle more funding and liquidity stress. Globally, China remains one of the biggest risks, because of its weakening property sector. However, the review says the direct links between Australia and China's financial systems are small.",
