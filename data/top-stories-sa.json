              "plaintext": "Israel's prime minister has begun to outline Israel's post-war plans for Gaza. However, they could contrast sharply with the US's vision. Benjamin Netanyahu says he would like to see Gaza would be demilitarised. Israel would retain the ability to enter Gaza freely to hunt down Hamas, he says. Benjamin Netanyahu also rejected the idea the Palestinian Authority, which administers parts of the Israeli-occupied West Bank, would control Gaza. Secretary of State Antony Blinken has previously said the US opposes an Israeli reoccupation of Gaza. The US envisions a unified Palestinian government in Gaza and the West Bank as a step toward a Palestinian state, something long opposed by Mr Netanyahu's government. Reporting with AP",
