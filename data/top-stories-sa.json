It went backwards in the March quarter, falling 0.2%. That means that, per person, Australia produced slightly less goods and services than it did in the final three months of last year. In turn, that means that, on average, we all consumed slightly less goods and services than we did at the end of last year. Another way of looking at it is that, on average, each Australian became a little poorer in real terms, that is adjusted for inflation. In fact, over the past year, while Australia's economy grew 2.3 per cent in real terms, in per capita real terms it grew just 0.3 per cent, because the population grew by around 2 per cent.",
