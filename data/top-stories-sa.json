The group said in a written statement cited by Reuters that the attack targeted three posts including a \"radar site\" in the Shebaa Farms, a slice of land occupied by Israel since 1967 that Lebanon has claimed as its own. As reported earlier, Israel responded on Sunday with artillery fire on southern Lebanon. Israel's military said one its drones struck a Hezbollah post in the area of Har Dov, an area in Shebaa. There have so far been no reports of casualties. Shebaa Farms was captured by Israel from Syria during the 1967 Mideast war, but Lebanon considers it and the nearby Kfar Chouba hills as Lebanese territories.
