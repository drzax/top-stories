A big night on Wall Street, with the US Federal Reserve opting to hold interest rates steady at 5.25-5.5% for the second straight meeting. The decision to keep rates on hold was widely expected, but comments after the meeting from Fed chair Jerome Powell have left markets feeling confident another rate rise is unlikely, according to OANDA's senior market analyst for the Americas Edward Moya. \"The Fed did not rule out a rate increase in the coming months, but swap contracts showed traders weren't convinced. \"The Fed tried to deliver a hawkish hold but Wall Street is not believing additional tightening will happen this cycle. The odds for a quarter-point rate rise by the end of January fell from 41% to 29%. \"Key quote: 'Tighter financial and credit conditions for households and businesses are likely to weigh on economic activity, hiring, and inflation.' \"This meeting the Fed is also acknowledging the tightening of financial conditions, and not just credit. Some might take this as a sign that the bond market will continue to help them with this tightening cycle, which could support the argument that a peak in rates is in place.\" Markets are currently pricing in a near certainty (99.5%) that the Fed will at least remain on hold until the end of this year. The tech heavy, and somewhat more speculative, Nasdaq was the prime beneficiary, jumping 1.6%, with the S & P 500 (1.1%) and Dow Jones Industrial Average (0.7%) posting smaller gains. The ASX futures are pointing to a similarly positive open locally, up 0.8%. But for mortgage borrowers hoping a Fed hold increases the odds of an RBA one, the market has bad news for you — money traders are still pricing in a better than 60% chance of an Aussie rate rise next Tuesday. Stay with us to see how Australian and regional traders respond to the latest hit out from the Fed.",
