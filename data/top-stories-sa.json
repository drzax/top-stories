ID Tours Limited and Tauranga Tourism Services were local agents that formed part of the supply chain between tourists from the Ovation of the Seas cruise ship and White Island. They were among the 13 parties charged with breaches of New Zealand's workplace health and safety laws after 22 people died when Whakaari erupted in December 2019. Last week, the two companies applied to have charges against them dismissed and today Judge Evangelos Thomas granted that application. âNeither Tauranga Tourism nor ID Tours had workers on Whakaari, it was never their workplace, they did not influence or direct the workers of the tour operators in the carrying out of their work,â he said while delivering his ruling in Auckland. Also last week, the owners of the volcano Peter, Andrew and Peter Buttle had charges against them dismissed. Their company Whakaari Management Limited is the only party that remains on trial. Five other defendants pleaded guilty before the trial began and a sixth had charges dismissed.",

The Westpac-Melbourne Institute survey of consumer sentiment fell by 1.5 per cent to 79.7 in September from 81 in August. A figure below 100 shows that pessimists outnumber optimists. The confidence of mortgage borrowers lifted 7.8 per cent over August, but confidence fell for renters (-6.1 per cent) and people who own their homes outright (-5.8 per cent). Westpac chief economist Bill Evans says that sentiment has languished at deeply pessimistic levels for more than a year, beaten only by the recession of the 1990s, when even weaker levels of confidence held for more than two years. \"Persistent permission has continued despite easing fears of further interest rate rises.\" \"The strong message from survey detail is of ongoing intense pressures on family finances.\" Mr Evans says a 15 per cent rise in petrol prices over the past two months is worsening concerns about the cost of living, on top of already strong increases in rent and electricity. Confidence in family finances fell by 4.4 per cent over the month, while fewer people thought it was a good time to buy a major household item (-3 per cent).",
