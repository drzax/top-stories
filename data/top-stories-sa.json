If you were following the news last week, you'd know Trump was indicted on conspiracy charges related to efforts to overturn the 2020 election result. After last week's court appearance, Trump posted on his Truth Social platform: \"IF YOU GO AFTER ME, I'M COMING AFTER YOU!\" That threatening post prompted prosecutors to respond with a late-night court application to have the former president prevented from going too far with his social posts. In particular, prosecutors raised concerns Trump could publicly reveal confidential material that they will need to give his legal team as part of the court process. They asked the court to issue a \"protective order\" that would restrict any sharing of that material to a select group of people with a direct stake in the case. A short time ago, Trump's legal team formally responded to the prosecution's request, asking the court to narrow the proposed order \"to shield only genuinely sensitive materials from public view\". It says the prosecutors' request represents an attempt by the government to limit Trump's First Amendment free speech rights. \"Worse, it does this against this administration's primary political opponent, during an election season in which the administration, prominent party members, and media allies have campaigned on the indictment,\" the response lodged with the court says. The court is yet to decide on the application.",

Jean Carroll, who won a $US5 million ($7.6 million) sex abuse lawsuit against him in May. The judge ruled that Trump can't claim Carroll defamed him by continuing to say she was not only sexually abused but raped. Trump attorney Alina Habba says Trump's lawyers will appeal \"the flawed decision\" to dismiss his counterclaim. Carroll is also pursuing her own defamation suit against Trump. Her lawyer, Robbie Kaplan, says Carroll is pleased with the ruling and looking ahead to a trial scheduled in January in her defamation suit, which concerns a series of remarks that Trump has made in denying her sexual assault allegation. Carroll accuses Trump of trapping her in a luxury department store dressing room in 1996, where the alleged incident occurred. Trump denies any of it happened, and even that they ran into each other at the store. He has accused her of inventing \"a fraudulent and false story\" to sell a memoir.",
