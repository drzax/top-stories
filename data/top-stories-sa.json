And it looks like the ASX will follow, with futures up more than 1 per cent. In the US, retail sales rose more than expected in August on higher gasoline prices, while initial claims for state unemployment benefits climbed to a seasonally adjusted 220,000 for the week ended September 9 from 217,000 the week before. Monthly producer prices for final demand rose 0.7 per cent last month, against expectations of a 0.4 per cent increase. On an annual basis, they increased 1.6 per cent compared with estimates of a 1.2 per cent rise. \"Today's economic data confirms the path toward a soft landing, but without being so hot that the Fed thinks they might need to do a couple more rate hikes,\" said Ross Mayfield, Investment Strategy Analyst at Baird. \"All together, it's pretty bullish.\" European stocks jumped to their biggest one-day percentage gain in six months, after the European Central Bank - hiking interest rates for the tenth straight time - suggested it was at the end of its monetary policy tightening cycle. The pan-European STOXX 600 rose 1.5 per cent and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.8 per cent. Oil prices surged to their highest since November as a tighter supply outlook offset demand concerns. Gold prices rebounded after an initial dip in opposition to the strengthening greenback.",

On arrival, the 47-year-old woman allegedly threatened police with the axe before barricading herself inside a unit. Specialist tactical officers, including negotiators, arrived before police gaining entry at about 9:45pm. Police used a taser along with a number of \"tactical options\" to take the woman into custody. She was then escorted from the scene to an ambulance, however, her condition deteriorated a short time later, and she was taken to John Hunter Hospital, where she later died. That investigation will be subject to an independent review. A report will be prepared for the coroner.",
