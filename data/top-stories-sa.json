The fall out from the rejection has been simmering for days, and Assistant Treasurer Stephen Jones telling the AFR that the rejection was in the national interest and would keep Qantas profitable on Monday only reignited the debate. Speaking to the ABC's senior business correspondent Peter Ryan, Mr Turner said the federal government needs to be up front about who ultimately signed off on vetoing Qatar's bid. \"I believe the recommendation from the Department of Transport to the minister, Catherine King, was that it be allowed,\" he told The World Today. \"But the story is that it was someone above her that basically had a captain's call, presumably the Prime Minister. \"So it'd be interesting to know: who actually made the call, who made the decision, what the recommendation was, and what was the reason for it? \"Because these are questions that [have] just not been answered yet.\" He said people deserve an explanation to understand what was behind the government's decision making process as they face expensive airfares when booking flights. \"A lot of people, a lot of industries, you know, relatively small industries in tourism and travel have been negatively affected by this, [they're seeing] nothing of the relatively expensive airfares that we still have, because there's not enough capacity for the demand at the moment. So airfares are going to stay up ,\" he said. Mr Turner also believes the issue could end up \"blowing up on the government\". \"I think it could, if they can't give, what their rationale was, what the reason was, who made the decision and why,\" he said.",

In July it was revealed that Transport Minister Catherine King had rejected Qatar's application for 21 additional flights into Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane per week, on top of its existing 28 weekly flights into Australia's major airports. Yesterday, the Australian Financial Review published comments from Assistant Treasurer Stephen Jones, who explained the government's decision to block the extra Qatar flights was in the national interest and would help keep Qantas profitable. During a Senate committee hearing in Melbourne yesterday, Qantas boss Alan Joyce denied twisting the government's arm on rejecting Qatar's proposal, but Mr Turner told The World Today the reasoning doesn't stack up, because there is a need for flight capacity to increase. \"There's no logic to it, and it is a bit of a worry because we have more demand than capacity ,\" he told the ABC's senior business correspondent Peter Ryan. \"So any extra capacity that certainly for our industry is very important. \"It was clearly not in the national interest as far as I can see. \"You could argue that it could have been in Qantas's interests, it certainly wasn't in Virgin's interest because they have a codeshare relationship with Qatar, so I just don't think it was an argument that held any water .\"",
