Unlike in federal and many other state cases, the names of those jurors are listed in the indictment, which has reportedly led to doxing. In a statement, the Fulton County Sheriff’s office says it \"is aware that personal information of members of the Fulton County Grand Jury is being shared on various platforms\". The Sheriff’s office says the matter is being taken \"very seriously\" and it’s working to track down the origins of the threats. Some online posts reportedly suggested jurors were harassed, but it’s not clear whether that has actually happened. It all adds to the tension around Fulton County, Atlanta, where Trump and his co-defendants have been given until the end of next week to appear at the Rice Street jail to be booked in the case, which is expected to involve the former president having his mugshot taken.",

AAP reports Football Australia is set to challenge Saudi Arabia for hosting rights to the 2026 Women's Asian Cup. The organisation has also been ambitious in its desire to bid for hosting rights to the men's World Cup in 2034 and the revamped Club World Cup in 2029. But the Women's Asian Cup in 2026 looms as a much more attainable proposition. Football Australia CEO James Johnson tells AAP: \"(A successful bid) would extend this window for a major growth in the Australian game which is really being turbocharged by the women's game. \"There's a lot of logic for that bid, it's calculated because women's football is growing rapidly around the world and in particular in Australia. \"We've seen the success of the Matildas at this World Cup and we know when we hosted the Asian Cup in 2015 that was a big success. \"We're taking it seriously and we're working with state and federal governments to make sure we have the right backing to get that over the line.\"",
