(Thanks for the question inspiration Kate) - Patrick. Hi Patrick, Last week, the Fair Work Commission said it was confident the coming increases in the minimum wage and award rates of pay would only make a \"modest\" contribution to wage growth in 2023-24 and \"will not cause or contribute to any wage-price spiral.\" Phil Lowe has also acknowledged that wages haven't been driving inflation up to this point. However, he says that doesn't mean wages won't start to push inflation higher if they start to get away from us. Here's what he said in today's statement about wages specifically: \"Wages growth has picked up in response to the tight labour market and high inflation. Growth in public sector wages is expected to pick up further and the annual increase in award wages was higher than it was last year. \"At the aggregate level, wages growth is still consistent with the inflation target, provided that productivity growth picks up.\" That last sentence says the wage growth we're seeing at the moment won't prevent the RBA from getting inflation back down into the 2% to 3% target range over time, as long as we see productivity growth pick up.",

I think we do need to be more creative in how we combat inflation. A couple of months ago, I wrote about an idea that John Maynard Keynes came up with to control inflation during WWII. Friedrich Hayek, the Austrian economist who really detested Keynes's influence on policymakers, even had to admit the idea was \"ingenious.\" Now, the possibility of using an idea like this would depend on the nature of the problem that's causing the inflation, and the nature of the inflation itself, but I think it helps to open one's mind to all possibilities - so we can see the world with fresh eyes sometimes. Could something like this work in the future?",
