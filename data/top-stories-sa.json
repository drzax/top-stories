Wall Street's action on Friday highlights this, with the S & P 500 index falling around 0.5% pushing it down into correction territory, which is when prices are off at least 10% from their most recent peak. The benchmark Wall Street index has dropped for eight sessions out of the past nine. \"The rise in global yields led by US Treasuries has triggered a reassessment on the equity outlook and more recently heightening geopolitical tensions have become an additional headwind with mixed corporate earnings reports not helping sentiment either,\" explained NAB's senior FX strategist Rodrigo Catril. In contrast, the Nasdaq edged higher after some positive profit news. \" Amazon, META and Intel Corp gained on Friday following better than expected earnings, helping the NASDAQ close 0.38% higher on the day, still the index was 2.62% lower on the week and down 4.36% month to date,\" Mr Catril added. But there isn't a big tech sector in Australia, so our market is poised for a fairly large drop. The ASX SPI 200 futures were down 1% ahead of the trading week.
