After all that, the US will be more disappointed not to get the win, as they were so dominant after getting that equaliser. They looked unstoppable once they had their full array of attacking talent going full throttle, so well done to the Dutch for holding out. Still, I think it has shown some chinks in the US armour, as they looked pretty rattled for much of that first half and some of the second. Rose Lavelle, who I maintain is the best player to watch in the world, added the dynamism the US needed in the second half. I expect she'll start for them in the next game.",
