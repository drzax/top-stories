              "plaintext": "While consumer confidence is near recession lows, business confidence is also taking a hit with \"worrying\" signs of a slowing in activity. National Australia Bank says in its latest monthly survey that business conditions continue to ease last month with notable declines in trading, profits and employment. NAB says confidence fell to -4 index points over May, well below the levels seen early in 2023, and business conditions fell 7 points to 8 index points. Forward orders fell sharply, especially in retail and wholesale as consumers cut back on spending. But NAB chief economist Alan Oster says while conditions are weakening, they are still remain above average levels. “Business conditions recorded a solid decline in May, and it appears the gradual easing we have seen through early 2023 appears to be strengthening,” said NAB Chief Economist Alan Oster. He says the decline in confidence occurred across most industries, although mining, manufacturing, transport and utilities saw \"modest improvements.\" “Confidence fell back into negative territory though has bounced around within the 0 to -4 index point range in recent month,” he said. “Our bigger worry is the sharp decline in forward orders in the month.” \"The forward orders measure typically leads business conditions and historically has been the best measure of economic activity”. “If orders persist at these levels we could well see ongoing sharp falls in business conditions, highlighting the risks around economic growth through the middle of this year.” “With the easing in business conditions accelerating and forward orders falling sharply, there is a growing risk that the RBA’s attempts to maintain an even keel ‘run aground.\"",
