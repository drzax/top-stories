Separately, data in the US on Friday showed the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, excluding the volatile food and energy components, increased 3.9 per cent on an annual basis for August. The Federal Reserve tracks the PCE price indexes for its 2 per cent inflation target. Back home, financials descended 0.1 per cent with two of the \"big four\" banks trading in negative territory. A slump in oil prices took energy stocks lower 0.7 per cent. Sector major Woodside Energy and Santos toppled over 0.1 per cent. On the other hand, gold stocks and technology stocks gained 0.8 per cent and 0.2 per cent, respectively. Export reliant miners also rose 0.6 per cent, with behemoths BHP and Rio Tinto trading in the positive territory.

Hancock said on Friday it raised its stake from 10.7 per cent last month to 12.4 per cent, paying no more than $3.00 per additional share. Hancock would be able to block the Albemarle deal with a 15 per cent position. Last month, Liontown accepted Albemarle's revised $US4.3 billion bid, or $3 a share. Albemarle, the world's largest lithium producer, is seeking to secure supplies of the key electric vehicle battery metal. The offer is part of a surge of interest in Australian lithium assets amid the clean energy transition. Hancock said last month it may seek a position on Liontown's board and could help the company bring its lithium resources to production. Last week, Liontown raised its capital cost to first production estimate for its Kathleen Valley lithium project by 6 per cent to $951 million but confirmed it would meet its target for production to start in mid-2024. Hancock said the increased cost estimate underscored the project's \"significant execution, operational ramp-up and market risks.\" Hancock said that the actual capital cost for the project could be in excess of $1 billion, factoring in inflation over time. Ms Rinehart, Australia's richest person, owns shares in lithium companies such as Patriot Battery Metals and Delta Lithium, in line with her recent focus on the sector.",
