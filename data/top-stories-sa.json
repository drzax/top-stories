The lack of reception meant for 12 hours, Keren lost contact with her sister. “The last 72 hours have been horrendous”, she said. They were evacuated “bit by bit” as it was safe to do so and a bus was organised to take them to a safe location. When leaving the safe room, Keren said her family described bodies everywhere. “It’s some miracle my whole family have survived and have been evacuated”.",

They're literally in an Israeli cage and Israel is harming them yet again.\" She felt like the world, including Australia, was treating Palestinian life as totally worthless and people in Gaza were living in fear not knowing when bombardments would happen. \"This is the first time Israel is going into a bombardment campaign having already taken the green light from governments like the Australian Government and the United States and other world governments,\" she said. \"They got the green light to go in and commit the war crimes. That can I do whatever they want and I think this is the lowest point in the Australian history where it comes to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict.\" She also said she was now worried about losing contact with those inside Gaza. \"Everything is cut off,\" she said. \"I know the hospitals are struggling, saying they are unable to deal with especially the casualties. The death rate is shooting through the roof. A lot of families have been wiped out in the last 48 hours.\" Watch the video below as Australians share stories of what their families are experiencing in Israel and Gaza.",

Mr Barr said while many people remain undecided, he accepts the likelihood of a victory for the Yes campaign is slim. \"I'm a little apprehensive and a little sad about what I anticipate might be the result on Saturday,\" Mr Barr said. \" It's not over by any sense but clearly Yes is the underdog at this point .\" When the campaign began earlier this year, Mr Barr said he hoped the ACT would record the highest Yes vote of any jurisdiction. Today he said he still thought that would be the case. \" I'm still confident that that will be over 50 per cent of the vote, but it may not be the sort of levels of support that we saw for marriage equality.\" The ACT has had its own Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander elected body since 2008. Mr Barr said it had been \"instrumental\" in achieving better outcomes for Indigenous people in the ACT. \"It's not perfect, not every issue has been solved, and no one is suggesting that the Voice will be able to solve every single issue, but it is an important step forward,\" he said.",

The Australian Electoral Commissioner is urging civility at polling booths, amid allegations of increasingly hostile behaviour towards electoral staff. \"It's important to contextualise. The behaviour of the vast, vast majority of voters and campaigners from all sides has been perfect. No issues,\" AEC Commissioner Tom Rodgers told RN Breakfast host Patricia Karvelas this morning. \" It is always a small number of people. I think, particularly a referendum, unleashes passions that can boil over. \"We've seen, what I would call, unacceptable conduct including filming of our staff who are just trying to do the right thing. \"We, as we have always done, are urging civility by everybody. \"The good thing is, that's mostly what we're seeing. I'm encouraging even more of it.\" You can listen to the full interview from RN Breakfast using the link below.",

LG has recalled batteries branded LG, SolaX, Opal, Red Earth, Eguana and VARTA, after it found the batteries could overheat and cause a fire. The batteries were first recalled in 2021 after at least nine reported incidents (including property damage and injury) in Australia. This latest recall includes more battery brands. The ACCC says consumers with affected batteries should switch off their systems and contact LG or SolaX to arrange a free replacement, software update or refund. \"It is critically important that anyone with a solar energy storage system checks their battery's serial number, as this recall has been updated to include new models, affected systems and dates of manufacture,\" said ACCC deputy chair Catriona Lowe. She warns even if you don't have an LG-branded solar storage system, you may still have an LG branded battery. LG has agreed to provide financial compensation to consumers who have higher electricity bills as a result of not being able to use their battery.

              "plaintext": "Continuing our series looking at some of the key names in this year's draft, it's time to head west with a look at Dan Curtin. His has been a name that has floated around heavily as the assumption has been West Coast will be desperate to land him, and could facilitate a pick-one trade as a result. While this is largely based on the fact he is from WA, it's also true that he is one of the brightest prospects in the draft. Curtin is a versatile player, tall enough to play as a key-position player and slick enough to move into the midfield, as he did often this year. His left foot is deadly, and he has the rare ability to slow play down around him when he is in possession. My question around Curtin is what position he ends up playing. I'm not sold that he will be a centre-half-back in the AFL, as I don't think he is quite strong enough in the air. His ability at ground-level and skills mean a midfield move is possible, but there just isn't enough exposed form there to be certain he will make it in that spot in the big leagues. But the worst case scenario in Curtin's case is he becomes a dangerous rebounding defender, who can pick teams apart with by foot and play on both tall and small forwards. There is scope for him to become a Jordan Dawson-esque midfielder though, with the leadership attributes to match. He is incredibly professional, and has all the attributes of a 200+ game AFL footballer. He'll more than likely go in the top five, and could well line up in round one for whoever picks him up. Sounds pretty damn good, hey?",
