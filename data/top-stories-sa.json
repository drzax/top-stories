He said the Yes vote would start low on that basis, but then rise. \"What we will be watching for on the night is when does this stop rising, and I would expect with about 10 per cent of the votes counted in each state, the trend will solidify by that point,\" Mr Green told Background Briefing. He said he would be watching for the trend in the cities when those votes come in, with polling showing the Yes vote was higher in inner cities than the outer suburbs. \"No state will vote 'Yes' unless the capital city votes 'Yes', so we will be waiting for a good sample of votes from cities like Sydney and Melbourne, and then looking at where they are from in those two cities\" he said. \"If the result is as clear cut as some of the polls, then we should have a very early call in most states. \"I would say say one hour after the close of counting in each state, unless its close, we should be able to call each state.\"",

One of the arguments being put forward by the No campaign is that First Nations people already have a voice. No campaign group Fair Australia singles out the little known government agency, the National Indigenous Australians Agency (NIAA), as an existing voice. \"Indigenous Australians already have a voice through the NIAA,\" said No campaigner Damien Pace while handing out \"Vote No\" pamphlets in the inner-city suburb of Ultimo last week.

There is no player in this draft as skilful as Nick Watson. He kicks goals most players couldn't dream of pulling off. He's a small forward who works hand all over the ground, and has had proven impact as a pinch-hitting midfielder. Sounds pretty good, right? What's the downside? The knock on Watson is he is 170cm tall. That makes him shorter than Caleb Daniel. But as Daniel, Brent Harvey and so many others have proven over the journey, height matters little when your football talent is immense enough. And in Watson's case, it certainly is. Concerns over his height won't be enough to deter clubs from making him a top-10 pick, but it might be enough to spook clubs right up the very top end. What is certain is that whoever picks him up is going to be treated to plenty of highlights, and one set of fans is going to have a new cult hero to love.",
