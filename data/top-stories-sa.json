              "plaintext": "A Palestinian doctor has painted a grim picture of life in Gaza under Israeli bombardment. Khamis Elessi, who is a neuro-rehabilitation and pain medicine consultant at the Islamic University of Gaza, told ABC News Radio he felt as if he was in a scene from the Living Dead. \"As I'm talking to you there are 13 people who've been brought from under the rubble of their homes without any prior warning, so the house was demolished on top of the residents,\" he said. Other times people were left running blindly looking for shelter after being given just minutes to evacuate. \"The next morning you open your windows and you look through it and you find it's still dark — even though it's 7am or 8am — not because there is no sun but because everything is covered with a thick layer of smog and smoke and fires are still igniting in so many buildings and so many roads,” he said. “People running amongst the shrapnel, the debris … car windows broken and they are running to seek new shelter and they are crying and their faces are covered with dark black smoke, they look like they are coming from Return of the Living Dead. It's just like an action movie about zombies.\" Doctors used to treating people in pain are now struggling to treat shrapnel wounds, and devasting injuries from explosions. \"The vast majority of injuries are children, the vast majority of dead are children and next to them is women unfortunately,\" he said, adding that without sufficient medicine or equipment doctors could not save them. He said hospitals were overwhelmed and not equipped to receive \"2,000 patients a day\" with morgues full and ice-cream refrigerators being used to store the dead.",

Darwin man Tai Bahar said he and other family members had no way of knowing what happened to his cousins who were at the Supernova music festival. \"That is the hard thing but with all this happening right now, there is so much uncertainty, with everything going on and they have been missing for over three days,\" he told ABC News Channel. \"There is no way to know what they have been through, what is going on and where they are.\" Mr Bahar also spoke of his relief that friends in Kfa Azza kibbutz, 5km outside Gaza, who had to hide in their safe room with their children when terrorists came and started shooting, are now safe. \" My friend, her husband and her two kids - one is three years old and the other one is a year old and they had to hide in the safe room as the terrorists arrived into the Kibbutz, her husband held the door because the secure room is designed for bomb attacks, not for anyone trying to infiltrate,\" he said. \"They had to manually hold the door to keep it safe and he held that for 27 hours as they tried to shoot at the door, trying to put all the furniture and burn them so they could go and kill them or whatever,\" \"They hid there for 27 hours. You can imagine having a 3-year-old and young baby, that is unimaginable.\"",

I don't think it's miles away, but it's not going to be enough. If I know Peter Bell and Fremantle, they will be waiting to see what Collingwood get back for Taylor Adams and will then be asking for both that and pick 19. That is probably too far the other way, but if a deal is to be done it will probably end up somewhere in the middle of that. There have also been reports that Freo are trying to stack up 2024 picks for a crack at some big-name recruits — Logan McDonald is the one most commonly mentioned — so perhaps that is something they might ask for from Collingwood. For all of Bell's comments that Freo are prepared to hold Schultz to his contract, I'm quite sure a deal will be done at some point between now and next Wednesday night.",
