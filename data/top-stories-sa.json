And it looks like it could be a positive start, adding to yesterday's rise, with ASX futures higher. It follows US markets making gains overnight, while Europe's Stoxx 600 posted its best rise in a month. Wall Street and European markets had a positive lead from the Asian session yesterday, where news of more stimulus measures from Beijing to support housing and stock trading buoyed trade. Locally, the major focus will be after the market closes, with incoming Reserve Bank governor Michele Bullock speaking in Canberra this evening. The topic of her speech is 'Climate Change and Central Banks' but her commentary will be closely-watched for any clues about the RBA's path ahead of her taking over the top job mid-September. Stick with us for more news and analysis through the day!",
