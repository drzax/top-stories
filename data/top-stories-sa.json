Senator Thorpe told RN's Patricia Karvelas that she believes the referendum \"gave platform for the racists\". \"The racism we've seen, the far-right Nazis coming out. All the bad behaviour from a lot of sections of our country, is part of an illness in this country that needs to be healed,\" she said. \"This is the government’s fault, this is Anthony Albanese’s fault we're seeing a rise in racism, we're seeing families split, we've seen communities divided.\" \"We should never have gone to this referendum in the first place.\" Listen to the full interview below.",

It will hold an extraordinary shareholder's meeting next month to approve the consolidation of its shares. Toshiba will be delisted from the Tokyo Stock Exchange on December 20. Last month the Japanese conglomerate announced the success of a 2 trillion yen ($US13.4 billion) tender offer from private equity firm Japan Industrial Partners. JIP purchased 78.65 per cent of Toshiba's shares. Toshiba can be dated back to 1875 when it began as a maker of telegraph equipment. Now it has divisions ranging from home electronics to nuclear power stations. It started trading on the Tokyo Stock Exchange in May 1949 when it reopened after World War II. In 1985 Toshiba launched what it called 'the first mass-market laptop computer'. But the attention it's gained hasn't always been positive. In 2015 Toshiba admitted to overstating its profits over six years. It sold its memory chip business in 2018 to avoid bankruptcy.",

It was the first time Mr Sayers has answered questions on the saga. My colleague Daniel Ziffer filed this update on his appearance. We have been waiting for a really long time to hear from the man who was a CEO are the key period tween 2012 and 2020 when tax information was taken from a confidential Treasury briefing and plans for how the then Treasurer Joe Hockey were taken, reverse engineered and then a scheme to get around those plans was sold to multinational tax companies around the world. PwC made millions of dollars from doing this, involving the global arms to sell these plans and deny Australian taxpayers getting more tax. It came to light earlier this year and we been waiting to hear from him and we finally did today. He is very sorry. \"Of course I feel terrible. I am sure every PwC person feels terrible. I feel… I feel accountable. It is a terrible, terrible situation. The bottom line is that there was a number of bad actor tax partners that behaviorally made the wrong choices,\" Mr Sayers told the hearing. Inquiries are ongoing - there is an AFP potential criminal inquiry, and ASIC and other bodies are looking at PwC consulting firms as well. The new CEO of the company, Kevin Burrowes, who has been brought in from overseas to try to clean up the mess, made it very clear that it was about multiple failures of leadership. The vast majority occurred during the time that Mr Sayers was a CEO. More to come on this long-running saga, which raises a lot of questions about government dealings with these consulting firms.",

Ryley Sanders is a big-bodied workhorse in midfield who dominated his under-18 year with his combination of inside grunt and outside skill. The Larke Medallist teamed up with Colby McKercher to lead the Allies to victory in the state champs and enjoyed a fantastic season with the Sandringham Dragons. He proved a commanding presence in midfield, a real leader of both sides, and quickly became a favourite among draft watchers. It's a stretch to say he plays like him, but with the blonde hair and pulled-up socks he does genuinely look like Jason Horne-Francis when he plays. He doesn't have the explosive athleticism of Horne-Francis, but he does move a bit like him and makes up for that lack of top-level pace with a fantastic work ethic. He's a little more one-paced than someone like McKercher, but he's quick enough. And when he's frame fills out further he could well be a force for any AFL midfield. North Melbourne are big fans and tried to get the AFL to let them have priority access to him via their NGA, but Sanders is available to all and sundry on the open market.",
