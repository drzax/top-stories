The RBA is expected to lift rates once more by 0.25 percentage points on Tuesday, and pause for the rest of the year as inflation is still running well above the target, according to a slim majority of economists in a Reuters poll. Here's what Reuters is saying: Although the RBA has raised rates by a total of 400 basis points since May 2022, inflation was still running at 6% in the last quarter (double the upper end of the 2-3% target range). A record low unemployment rate and a rebound in house prices in Australia - one of the world's most expensive housing markets - suggests the RBA still needs to raise base borrowing costs. Most global central banks are inching closer to the end of an historic tightening campaign, including the US Federal Reserve, and economists also expect the RBA will be done soon. 36 economists were surveyed by Reuters, in a poll taken on July 26-28. Over 55% of those economists forecast the RBA to raise its official cash rate by 25 basis points to 4.35%, the highest in nearly 12 years, at its August 1 meeting. The remaining 45% expected no change to the cash rate target. But financial markets were pricing in only a one in five chance of that happening. Among major local banks, Commonwealth Bank and Westpac expected a 25 basis points hike tomorrow, while ANZ and NAB predicted a pause.",
