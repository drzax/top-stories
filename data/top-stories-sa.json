Net gain from yields and investment markets was $724 million (a big improvement over the $190 million loss in the previous year). Last week, the $4.9 billion sale of Suncorp's banking arm to ANZ was blocked by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. Suncorp now expects the separation (and other costs related to the deal) to increase from $500 million to between $575 million and $600 million.

              "plaintext": "Australia's largest bank has reported that its statutory full-year profit has jumped 5% to $10.19 billion. The Commonwealth Bank's earnings were propped up by its net interest margin (NIM) — the difference between how much the bank pays to borrow money and how much interest it charges to lend money. The bank's NIM rose to 2.07% (up 0.17 percentage points). However, its profit was somewhat weighed down by its loan impairment expenses, which rose $1.47 billion, which reflects ongoing cost of living pressures. CBA also reported that its annual cash profit (its preferred measure of earnings) lifted 6% to $10.16 billion. The company also said it will buy back an additional $1 billion worth of stock from the market, and declared a fully-franked final dividend of $2.40 per share (which is 30 cents more than a year earlier). CBA and its competitors saw their margins rebound, thanks to the Reserve Bank's aggressive rate-hiking cycle. But there are concerns about rising bad debts as the banks' mortgage units are expected to take a hit from higher borrowing costs. CBA warned that for the next financial year \"competition, customer deposit switching and higher wholesale funding costs\" could impact its margins, partly offset by the benefit of higher average cash rates.",

The Australian share market is likely to start its day slightly lower, with ASX futures down 0.1%. It's likely to follow a weak lead from Wall Street, which was weighed down by concerns about the health of the US banking sector and broader economy. This was after Moody's cut the credit ratings of 10 small- to mid-sized US banks by one notch, and placed six banking giants (including Bank of New York Mellon, US Bancorp, State Street and Truist Financial) on review for potential downgrades. It also comes after fellow ratings agency, Fitch, downgraded the United States last week (to AA+) due to its surging debt over the next three years, and repeated down-to-the-wire debt ceiling negotiations. On top of that, Italy sent shockwaves across the European banking sector by setting a one-off 40% tax on Italian bank profits reaped from higher rates, after reprimanding lenders for failing to reward depositors. Locally, the highlight is reporting season — with Commonwealth Bank and Suncorp reporting their results today.",

Los Angeles Superior Court Judge David Herrifor handed down the sentence to the 31-year-old who was convicted on three felonies in December. Herriford said it was “difficult to reconcile” the kind, charitable person and good father many people described Lanez as being during the sentencing hearing with the person who fired the gun at Megan. “Sometimes good people do bad things,” he said. “Actions have consequences, and there are no winners in this case.” Megan Thee Stallion that Lanez fired the gun at the back of her feet and shouted for her to dance as she walked away from an SUV in which they had been riding in July 2020, after leaving a pool party at Kylie Jenner’s Hollywood Hills home. She had to have surgery to remove bullet fragments. “Since I was viciously shot by the defendant, I have not experienced a single day of peace,” Megan said in a statement read by a prosecutor on Monday. “Slowly but surely, I’m healing and coming back, but I will never be the same.” Lanez asked the judge for mercy before his sentencing. “If I could turn back the series of events that night and change them I would,\" he said. “The victim was my friend, the victim is someone I still care for to this day.” “Everything I did wrong that night, I take full responsibility for.”",

Perry was diagnosed with cancer in 2016, and his wife confirmed his death in a statement. \"Casper was a fun-loving, giving person,\" she says. \"He was a genuine, family oriented man. He loved Chicago with all his heart. He will be greatly missed.\" His Cha-Cha Slide continues to be a favorite at weddings, clubs and many other events about two decades after it became popular. Participants typically dance in lines and rows, following commands to a funky beat on when and where to step, stomp, hop and slide. In a May interview, he said that the Cha-Cha Slide initially was an aerobic exercise for his nephew who worked at a fitness club. It would go on to become popular in many countries. \"From there, it just took off,\" he said. \"I have one of the biggest songs that's played at all stadiums: hockey, basketball, football, baseball, they played it at the Olympics. \"It was something that everybody could do.\"",
