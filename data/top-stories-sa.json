The one-year loan prime rate was reduced by 0.1 percentage points to 3.45% — down from 3.55% previously, while the 5-year rate remains at 4.2%. The reduction to lending rates comes as Chinese authorities try to stimulate demand for credit, with the world's second-largest economy faltering due to a worsening property slump, weak consumer spending and falling credit growth — all of which encouraged more policy stimulus. Most analysts had predicted a cut to both rates, which China had done in June to boost the economy. In China, most new and outstanding loans are based on the one-year loan prime rate, while the 5-year rate influences mortgage prices. The cut to the one-year rate followed the People's Bank of China unexpectedly lowering its medium-term policy rate last week, which is broadly considered a determinant to the future changes of other economic benchmarks. The decision in China has also caused Asian markets to stumble slightly, as investors are hoping there will be a repeat of substantial fiscal spending that has bolstered its economy in the past.",

Echo Law alleges Qantas's failure to refund money when flights were cancelled, in accordance with its own conditions of carriage, was unlawful during the COVID-19 pandemic. But in a statement from a Qantas spokesperson, the airline rejects the claims put forward in the proceedings, and says it had not been served a claim as of midday (AEST) today. Here's the full statement from the airline: \"We completely reject these claims. \"We have already processed well in excess of $1 billion in refunds from COVID credits for customers who were impacted by lockdowns and border closures. \"The majority of customers with COVID credits can get a refund and we've been running full page ads and sending emails to encourage customers who want a refund to contact us directly. \"Qantas has one of the most flexible COVID credit policies of any airline, including among our global peers, and we've extended the expiry dates three times. \"We've made a number of improvements to our systems along the way, including simplifying the process for a refund and making the credits easier to use, and that's clear from the amount of credit that has already been claimed.\" Qantas additionally notes that there was about $400 million in COVID credits remaining for Australian customers as at June 2023, ranging between $100 and $500, with a \"large number of bookings\" made through travel agents.",

The slip is thanks to investors being disappointed by China's policymakers and its smaller-than-expected lending rate cuts (more on that in a moment). It is a mixed bag across the sectors — consumer non-cyclicals are down 0.9%, health care has dropped 0.6%, and financials and basic materials are down 0.3% each. For the academic and educational sector, it's gained 1.4% — the most out of any sector today — while consumer cyclicals are up 1.1% and energy has gained 0.7%.
