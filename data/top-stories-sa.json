That's because while people generally have a pretty good understanding of what a recession is, throwing \"per capita\" in front of it makes it a bit harder to digest. I'll break it down for you though. A recession is generally defined by economists as there being two successive negative quarters of economic growth (or GDP being a negative percentage). But a per capita recession adds the caveat that the country experiences two successive negative quarters of economic growth *per person*. Looking at the GDP per capita in today's figures, we are we can see that it fell by 0.3% in the March quarter, and by 0.3% again in the June quarter — meeting that technical definition for a per capita recession. So what does that actually mean? Basically, it might not *look* like the country is in recession, but it *feels* like one. As for why we're experiencing this decline in GDP per person — it all comes back to the fact population growth is outpacing economic growth when (we ignore immigration). In fact, the RBA forecasted a per capita recession all the way back in May — you can watch Alan Kohler's finance report from May 5 below to hear their reasoning:",

The economy expanded by 0.4 per cent over the June quarter and by 2.1 per cent over the year to June according to the Bureau of Statistics. Services exports rose 12.1 percent driven by travel services as the number of international students and tourists returned as Australia continued to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic. Higher population growth is expanding the economy, but income per person has fallen for the second quarter in a row, essentially a per capita recession. The ABS says that population growth due to post-pandemic migration saw GDP per capital fall 0.3 per cent, following a similar fall of 0.3 per cent in March. ABS head of national accounts Katherine Keenan says the household saving to income ratio fell for the seventh consecutive quarter to 3.2 per cent, its lowest level since June quarter 2008. “The fall in the household saving ratio was driven by higher interest payable on dwellings, income tax payable and increased spending by households due to the rising cost of living pressures,\" she said. Total income received by households rose 1.8 per cent, driven by interest received and compensation of employees. Sean Langcake from BIS Oxford Economics says net exports bounced back over the June quarter with good weather seeing an increase in mining shipments. But household spending is weak. \"Household consumption growth is in the doldrums,      increasing by just 0.1 per cent quarter on quarter.\" \"Spending on discretionary items continues to      fall, with vehicle purchases a lone bright spot. \" \"Spending on essentials remains      steady, buoyed by the relatively strong pace of population growth.\"",

I won't hit you with them all at once, but here's the first few that mention some terms you'll be familiar with: Inflation continued to moderate. The consumer price index rose 0.8 per cent in the June quarter and was up 6.0 per cent in the past 12 months. This marked the second consecutive quarter of lower annual inflation, down from the peak of 7.8 per cent in the December 2022 quarter. Food prices increased 1.6 per cent during the quarter, and housing costs as measured in the CPI rose 0.8 per cent. Higher interest rates squeezed consumption. Households shelled out $82.8 billion in mortgage interest payable during the year. This was almost double last year’s interest bill. Discretionary household spending fell 0.5 per cent in the June quarter, which was the third quarterly fall in a row. Spending on furnishings and household equipment fell for the fifth quarter in succession, down 3.4 per cent in annual terms. Retail sales fell 0.5 per cent during the quarter, and retail inventories fell sharply. We worked more hours. We spent 2.4 per cent more time at work than we did last quarter, which, excluding the COVID-19 pandemic, was the fastest quarterly increase in hours worked on record. We worked 6.8 per cent more hours this year than last year, and with GDP rising by a smaller amount, labour productivity fell 3.2 per cent in annual terms.",
