The news comes as the Kremlin tries to source military equipment for use in its war in Ukraine. The US official said they were not sure exactly where or when the meeting would take place, but the Pacific port city of Vladivostok would be a likely possibility given its relative proximity to North Korea. In a rare trip abroad, Kim would travel from Pyongyang, probably by armoured train to meet Putin, the New York Times reports, citing US and allied sources. At the meeting, the two leaders will discuss Kim sending Russia artillery shells and anti-tank missiles in exchange for Moscow's advanced technology for satellites and nuclear-powered submarines, the newspaper reports.",
