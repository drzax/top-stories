              "plaintext": "The Australian share market has rebounded in broad-based buying on Tuesday. Energy and mining stocks are leading the gains on the back of strong underlying commodity prices, while Commonwealth Bank rose after posting forecast-beating quarterly results. The ASX 200 index was up 0.6% to 6,991 points, after a two-session slide (and posted its biggest intraday percentage gain since November 3) Investors across the globe awaited US inflation data due out on Wednesday morning (AEDT) to gauge the monetary policy trajectory of the Federal Reserve. In Australia, energy stocks rose 2.4% after eight straight sessions of losses, and were set to climb the most since October 18, if gains hold. The sub-index received a boost from an overnight jump in oil prices as worries eased about falling demand in major oil importers like the United States and China. Beach Energy and Paladin Energy jumped 2.8% and 5.4%, respectively, to lead gains on the sub-index. Mining stocks rose 1.6%, tracking gains in iron ore prices amid optimism over stimulus measures for China's steel-heavy property sector. The sub-index was on course to gain the most in three weeks. Rio Tinto and BHP rose by 1.4% and 1.3% respectively. Shares of CBA lifted 0.6% after its first-quarter cash earnings beat market expectations. National Australia Bank slumped 3.1% in ex-dividend trading. Basically, if you didn't own shares in NAB before today, you won't receive its next dividend. Among individual stocks, ALS jumped 6.8% to become the top gainer in the benchmark index, as the business support firm posted steady half-year revenue and forecast margin improvement for its businesses in the second half of the 2023-24 financial year.",

Consumer sentiment fell 2.6% to a reading of 79.9 points in November, according to the latest Westpac-Melbourne Institute report. That score is consistent with the lows seen during the global financial crisis and the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. Also, any score below 100 points means the pessimists outweigh the optimists. \"The RBA's November rate hike has put renewed pressure on family finances and reignited concerns about both the rising cost of living and the prospect of further rate rises to come,\" said Westpac senior economist Matthew Hassan. \"Previous months had been showing some tentative signs that sentiment was starting to lift out of the deep pessimism that has prevailed since the middle of last year. \"That rally looks to have been cut short before it even really began. \"Consumers remain wary of the potential for more rises.\" He also said: \"The weak November sentiment print is an ominous sign heading into the Christmas high season. \"Pessimism is having a major bearing on spending attitudes. \"Our November surveys include an additional question about Christmas spending intentions, asking consumers whether they plan to spend less, the same or more on gifts than last year. \"Responses point to another 'penny-pinching' Christmas this year with nearly 40% of consumers planning to spend less on gifts.\"",

The country's biggest lender said its quarterly cash net profit after tax was $2.5 billion (same as the year before). A string of rate hikes since last year have boosted interest incomes and margins at Australian banks as they charged more on customer loans. But rising cost of repayments has intensified competition in the mortgage market, capping profit margins and hindering credit growth. CBA's home loan balances declined $4.5 billion in the quarter. \"This reflects a disciplined approach to pricing which ensures marginal shareholder returns remain above the cost of capital in a highly competitive market,\" the lender said in a statement. Net interest margin was lower in the quarter, mainly due to continued competitive pressure in deposits and customers switching to higher yielding deposits, CBA added. Its common equity tier 1 ratio, a measure of spare cash, stood at 11.8% as of September-end.",
