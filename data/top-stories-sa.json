It's simply referring to how much the prices of services (think hairdressing, vet services, insurance) are rising — and last week's inflation data from the ABS showed that services inflation was gathering pace while goods inflation was falling. You can see the divergence between the two below: The ABS said inflation in the prices for services recorded its largest annual rise since 2001, driven by higher prices in a range of services categories including rents, restaurant meals, holiday travel and insurance. Services inflation is now running at 6.3%, up from 6.1% in the March quarter. So it's still heading higher, but g oods inflation is definitely heading down — it's at 5.8%, down from 7.6% in March.",

Governor Philip Lowe said in his statement that it may be necessary as inflation is still running at 6 per cent annually, which is well above the RBA's 2 to 3 per cent range. Betashares chief economist David Bassinese is expecting one more interest rate rise later this year. \"The RBA’s decision to keep rates on hold is a just reward for an economy showing tentative signs of solving its inflation problem without needing to go into recession.\" \"With medium term inflation expectations still contained as well as ongoing downside risks to consumer spending, the RBA can afford to give the economy the benefit of the doubt for at least a little while longer. \" Mr Bassinese says the RBA should take heart from the signs of slowing services inflation (eg the cost of electricity). \"There's a good chance we’ve seen the last rate increase this cycle.\" \"My base case, however, is sufficient resilience in consumer spending in the coming months will see the RBA raise rates one last time in November.\" Capital Economic's Australia and New Zealand economist Abhijit Surya says most market economists expected the central bank to raise rates by 0.25 per cent today. \"The RBA's decision to leave its cash rate unchanged at 4.1 per cent means that its almost certain that our forecast for a terminal rate of 4.6 per cent won't come to fruition.\" Mr Surya notes that the RBA now predicts inflation won't come back to its target range of 2 to 3 per cent until the end of 2025, instead of mid-2025. \"However, barring any new inflationary shocks, there's a good chance the RBA is done tightening altogether.\" But he doesn't see any rate cuts, if any, until next year because of high services inflation and the strong employment market.",

PropTrack Senior Economist Eleanor Creagh says slowing inflation is behind the pause in interest rate rises by the RBA. “Subsiding momentum in inflation and consumer spending has eased the pressure on the RBA to continue lifting interest rates, allowing more time to assess the economic outlook as it tries to engineer a soft landing while returning inflation to target.\" \"Though still high relative to history, and well above the RBA’s 2-3 per cent target range, CPI inflation was below both market expectations and the RBA’s official forecasts and looks set to continue to moderate and move lower into the first half of 2024.” But Mortgage Choice chief executive Anthony Waldron points out that banks are still increasing mortgage rates despite the RBA staying on hold last month. “Borrowers will be pleased to see that the Reserve Bank has held the cash rate steady for the second month running; however, a stable cash rate in July didn’t stop the nation’s lenders from lifting rates on some fixed- and variable-rate home loan products.”",
