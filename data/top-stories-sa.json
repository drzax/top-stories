Spaces is a public feature on Twitter where users can have live audio conversations. Any user with 600 or more followers can host a Space, and up to 13 people can speak at any given time. It's an interesting choice considering the platform isn't easily accessible to everyone. New York Times reporter Nicholas Nehamas wrote: \"One older donor told me he had no idea how to join a Twitter Space.\" The session will be moderated by tech entrepreneur and close Musk confidant David Sacks — according to NBC, he's a major Republican donor supporting DeSantis and is considered to be part of Musk's inner circle on decisions about Twitter. Earlier this week, Musk said he's \"interested in Twitter being somewhat of a town square.\" During a conference hosted by the Wall Street Journal this week, Musk said he was not \"at this time planning to endorse any particular candidate.\" But back in November Musk said he would support DeSantis in 2024 if the Florida governor were to run for president. \"My preference for the 2024 presidency is someone sensible and centrist. I had hoped that would the case for the Biden administration, but have been disappointed so far,\" Musk had said on Twitter.",

The Fed seems very divided by those 'hawks' who believe rates need to keep going up until inflation falls back much closer to target and 'doves' who believe that the current level of rates will do that job, given some time. This from ANZ research's morning note, compiled by John Bromhead : \"Fed officials were divided at the May meeting over whether further hikes would be needed. \"Some were concerned that inflation was not falling fast enough, warranting further hikes, while others noted the full effects of past tightening are yet to be felt and tighter credit conditions from recent banking sector stresses could be equivalent to one or two hikes. \"Officials stressed that future decisions will be dependent on the incoming data, supporting what has been said by Fed speakers in recent weeks. Markets are currently pricing in a 29% chance of a hike in June.\" Meanwhile, a report from the AFR's political correspondent Phillip Coorey (paywalled) suggests another Philip, Lowe, is not done with raising interest rates in Australia. Apparently, the RBA governor gave a very pessimistic private briefing to members of the House of Representatives economics committee, saying the odds of staying on the \"narrow path\" between avoiding recession and getting inflation down were not great. He also reportedly said that he doesn't have any tolerance for inflation remaining high for a long time and will do what he believes needs to be done to get it back down.",
