Political reporter Evelyn Manfield explains what's being debated: This is the second tranche of the government's industrial relations reform. Under the change, the Fair Work Act would be amended to close a so-called loophole where an employer and employees have agreed through an enterprise agreement to a particular rate of pay, but then that pay is undercut when the employer brings in different workers through labour hire. The bill is also promising to introduce greater protections for gig economy workers and casuals, and increase penalties for wage theft. But business groups are opposing the changes, arguing they add complexity and will drive up costs. Political reporter Stephanie Borys was on News Breakfast earlier and said the bill will be debated for four weeks in the House of Representatives before it goes to the Senate where the government needs to find the numbers from the Greens and crossbench to get it through.",

              "plaintext": "US stock indexes settled for a mixed close on Friday after a US jobs report showed an uptick in unemployment, cementing expectations that the Federal Reserve will let interest rates stand at its September meeting. The three major indexes gave up earlier advances, losing momentum as the session progressed and investors digested the data ahead of the long US holiday weekend. The S & P 500 and the Dow ended modestly green, while the tech-laded Nasdaq closed nearly unchanged. All three indexes notched gains on the week. \"Today, people are coasting into the holiday weekend with relief that the job numbers were solid,\" said Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist at Carson Group in Omaha. \"There are signs of the economy slowing, which is what the Fed wants to see,\" Detrick added. \"It likely opens the door for no rate hike at the next Fed meeting in three weeks.\" The Labor Department's payrolls report showed the US economy added more jobs than expected last month, but the rising unemployment and participation rates, along with a welcome cool-down in average hourly wage growth, solidified expectations that the Fed will let key interest rates stand this month. Financial markets are pricing in a 93 per cent likelihood of such a pause this month, according to CME's FedWatch tool. But what the Fed will do beyond September remains an open question.",
