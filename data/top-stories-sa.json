Speaking to RN's Patricia Karvelas, Mr Wyatt said he was \"disappointed\" with Mr Dutton's behaviour in the lead-up to the referendum. \"I'm disappointed because Peter was part of the process, he had access to the information and he never had a serious discussion with me on the voice,\" he said. \"The arguments that he's putting forward are not factual, they're contentious in order to create fear and division and they are intentional in order to sink the voice.\" Mr Wyatt agreed that much of the Liberal party's Voice messaging is \"Trumpian\". \"Some of the tactics are copybook out of America. The fake news, the statements of 'You'll end up paying Aboriginal people', 'You'll lose land', 'You won't be able to do this'. That concerns me,\" Mr Wyatt said. Listen to the full interview below.",

She also says Australia is engaging with Egypt and the US about seeking to establish humanitarian corridors out of Gaza, \"but obviously the situation on the ground is extremely difficult\". Ms Wong also stressed the importance of \"calm leadership\" and bringing Australians together, rather than creating division. \"It is time for all of us to say we stand against all hatred, all prejudice. There is no place for anti-Semitism, as there is no place for discrimination and prejudice of any kind. It is a time for us to come together. \"We know this is distressing for the Jewish community. We know there are many in Australia who have very strong views about the Palestinian aspirations and I would say this — one of the great tragedies, apart from the horrific nature of Hamas' actions, one of the great tragedies of what they have done is they have pushed further away the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinian people.\"",

As you will see, Wall Street ended in the red and the futures for Australian markets show we will likely follow. The CPI data shows that price hikes aren't over in the world's biggest economy, with headline rising above consensus estimates by 0.3% a month and core inflation about the same. That, of course, is creating concern that the US federal reserve will raise rates again to tackle price spikes. This note from CBA this morning: Notwithstanding, we doubt the downtrend in inflation has been thrown off course.  The outlook for the US consumer is poor given the resumption of student loan repayments, lower government benefit payments, and the erosion of pandemic savings.  At the same time, interest rates on consumer loans have risen sharply to very high levels.  Indeed, some FOMC officials have recently said the rise in yields may substitute for further FOMC tightening.  Our baseline remains for the FOMC to keep the Funds rate steady into early 2024.  We consider the FOMC’s significant policy tightening will lead the global economy into recession. Recession fears are also being sparked by the devastating crisis in the Middle East.
