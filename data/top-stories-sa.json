Matildas coach Tony Gustavsson cut to the chase when asked about the role Australia's superstar captain would play in Saturday's Women's World Cup quarterfinal. Kerr has played a tick over 10 minutes against Denmark to date, with a starting front four of Caitlin Foord, Mary Fowler, Emily van Egmond and Hayley Raso thriving in her absence. But Gustavsson dismissed the suggestion dropping someone for Kerr, if she is fit to start after returning from her calf injury, could disrupt that dynamic. \"They've been amazing teammates supporting each other. There's been no complaints whatsoever in terms of if you start or come off the bench - they know their role and they play their role,\" Gustavsson said. \"And I definitely would never, ever see Sam as a disturbance to the team. \"I want to be very clear in here now to say if Sam is fit to play 90 minutes, she is starting. There is not even a question and the team knows it. \"We're talking about Sam Kerr here. \"Whether she is ready to play 90 minutes plus extra time, that's to be decided tonight. But there is no question whatsoever that if she is, she is starting.\" -AAP",

Mr Lowe replied by saying although they could provide short-term solutions to the problem, it would ultimately make the problem of a lack of affordable rentals worse. Here's his full response to that question: \"When housing prices were rising quickly, people were saying, 'Well, we need to give people more money to help with them,' and when rents are rising quickly, 'We need to kind of cap the rent increases'. \" They're short-term fixes that both of them, in my judgment, make the problem worse. \"So what I would like to see is a longer-term focus on this because the short-term solutions, or the short-term responses, are not solutions, and generally giving people more money or capping prices doesn't help with the balance of supply and demand in the market. \" In most cases, rent controls reduce incentive to add to supply, so it might help in the short run, it might relieve some pressure on people in the short run, and clearly that's the case, but we've got to keep the medium-term perspective on this. \"Will that add to the supply of rental accommodation over time? My judgment would be that it would not and could actually reduce it. \"It might help in the short run but create problems in the long run.\"",
