The supermarket giants are in court after joint trial was brought by the Fair Work Ombudsman and two class action claimants, alleging that workers have been underpaid for a number of years. In his opening address, Fair Work Ombudsman barrister Justin Bourke KC argued the \"entirely foreign\" payment structure covering some workers would always \"end badly for Woolworths and Coles and its employees\". He took Justice Nye Perram to the relevant award, arguing work hours were set at a total of 38 rostered hours per week, before contending that was not what happened in reality. In an \"extreme\" example, Mr Bourke said one team manager in Sydney was working 13 hours a day. Other workers were doing average shifts of nearly 11 hours, he said. He said evidence would show clear standards had to be met by the companies, and that there was tacit approval of the alleged illegal conduct, submitting they knew people were working above rostered hours \"day in day out\". There were failures on the use of \"informal\" rosters, time off in lieu, and record keeping on worker overtime, penalties and allowances, he said. \"No one blew a whistle,\" Mr Bourke said. \"They knew it was going on and they have to pay for it.\" The trial is expected to run for seven weeks.",

All these figures are 'quarter on quarter' - from the last quarter of 'September to the end of the December' compared to 'January to March'. Overall: +0.5% Retail: -2.1% Accommodation and food services: -14% But it described the sector data as \"very whippy\", meaning it moves around a lot. For example, in the three months before, accommodation and food services was +16.7 per cent. The sector-level profit data are very whippy so we wouldn't over-extrapolate the swing, though the details are certainly consistent with policy gaining traction and reducing nominal spending.",
