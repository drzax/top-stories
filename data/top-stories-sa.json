Hi Natty — even if you haven't been a Latitude customer directly, you might have applied for a financial product with them years ago, before they were even known as Latitude Financial. Before the Latitude brand became a household name (and a feature on the back of the Richmond Tigers guernsey, if you're AFL inclined like myself), they were GE Money — and have quite the history, including as Coles and Myer-branded credit cards. I did a deep dive on Latitude's history back in April, which you can read below. Hopefully it sheds some light into why you might have been contacted (and sorry to hear you've been caught up in their cyber breach).",
