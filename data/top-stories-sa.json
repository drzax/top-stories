Netanyahu's comments this week suggesting that Israel would be responsible for Gaza security indefinitely drew pushback from the United States, Israel's main ally, with Washington saying it would oppose Israeli post-war occupation of Gaza. \"We don't seek to conquer Gaza, we don't seek to occupy Gaza, and we don't seek to govern Gaza,\" Netanyau told Fox News. Netanyahu said a civilian government would need to take shape in Gaza but that Israel would make sure something like the October 7 attack does not happen again. \"So, we have to have a credible force that, if necessary, will enter Gaza and kill the killers. Because that's what will prevent the reemergence of a Hamas-like entity,\" Netanyahu said. US officials say the Palestinian Authority (PA), which has limited self-rule in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, should return to govern Gaza after the war. Hamas seized control of Gaza from the PA forces of President Mahmoud Abbas in 2007. Top Palestinian officials, including Abbas, say a PA return to Gaza must be accompanied by a political solution that ends Israel's occupation of territory it captured in the 1967 Middle East war. Netanyahu said that after the war, \"what we have to see is Gaza demilitarised, deradicalised and rebuilt\". Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh told PBS this week the PA would not return to Gaza \"on the back of an Israeli tank\". Reuters",

Overnight Israel's military conducted a raid in the city of Jenin, reportedly killing 14 people. Doctors Without Borders said on the morning of the raid \"leaflets were dropped on Jenin refugee camp, telling residents to evacuate, many of whom have no safe place to go\". The group said it witnessed Israeli forces firing at the entrance of a hospital, shooting at an emergency unit and using military vehicles to block ambulances from entering hospitals. A paramedic was also shot while inside an ambulance, the charity said. \"Hospitals are not targets and must remain safe spaces. Medical care must not be impeded,\" Doctors Without Borders said on X. \"We call on the Israeli military to stop firing on hospitals and to stop their military vehicles from blocking ambulances and medical staff from reaching health care facilities.\" Israel's military has not released a response to these claims, but said on social media that it had conducted \"counterterrorism activity\" in the Jenin refugee camp and killed multiple terrorists.",
