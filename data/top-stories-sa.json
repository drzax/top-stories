Japan has a whopping 24 shots in that game, 12 on target, so will they be a bit frustrated that they could only score two? Perhaps. But it's not goals that they needed tonight, just the three points. You'd think Spain will provide a sterner test next time out when they meet in Wellington/Ta Whanganui-a-Tara on Monday, but that's a then problem. For Costa Rica though, that's a second-straight defeat that essentially puts them out of the tournament.",

Iron ore, copper and aluminium prices fell leading to a $US3.3 billion drop in earnings, although the bottom line was helped by increased iron ore sales. Iron ore prices fell by an average of 14 per cent and copper prices were 10 per cent lower over the half. Rio's earnings were also hit by an $US800 million ($1.2 billion) writedown of its alumina refineries in Australia.
