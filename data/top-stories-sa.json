Khamis Elessi, who is a neuro-rehabilitation and pain medicine consultant at the Islamic University of Gaza, told ABC News Radio he felt as if he was in a scene from the Living Dead. \"As I'm talking to you there are 13 people who've been brought from under the rubble of their homes without any prior warning, so the house was demolished on top of the residents,\" he said. Other times people were left running blindly looking for shelter after being given just minutes to evacuate. \"The next morning you open your windows and you look through it and you find it's still dark â even though it's 7am or 8am â not because there is no sun but because everything is covered with a thick layer of smog and smoke and fires are still igniting in so many buildings and so many roads,â he said. âPeople running amongst the shrapnel, the debris â¦ car windows broken and they are running to seek new shelter and they are crying and their faces are covered with dark black smoke, they look like they are coming from Return of the Living Dead. It's just like an action movie about zombies.\" Doctors used to treating people in pain are now struggling to treat shrapnel wounds, and devasting injuries from explosions. \"The vast majority of injuries are children, the vast majority of dead are children and next to them is women unfortunately,\" he said, adding that without sufficient medicine or equipment doctors could not save them. He said hospitals were overwhelmed and not equipped to receive \"2,000 patients a day\" with morgues full and ice-cream refrigerators being used to store the dead.",

Darwin man Tai Bahar said he and other family members had no way of knowing what happened to his cousins who were at the Supernova music festival. \"That is the hard thing but with all this happening right now, there is so much uncertainty, with everything going on and they have been missing for over three days,\" he told ABC News Channel. \"There is no way to know what they have been through, what is going on and where they are.\" Mr Bahar also spoke of his relief that friends in Kfa Azza kibbutz, 5km outside Gaza, who had to hide in their safe room with their children when terrorists came and started shooting, are now safe. \" My friend, her husband and her two kids - one is three years old and the other one is a year old and they had to hide in the safe room as the terrorists arrived into the Kibbutz, her husband held the door because the secure room is designed for bomb attacks, not for anyone trying to infiltrate,\" he said. \"They had to manually hold the door to keep it safe and he held that for 27 hours as they tried to shoot at the door, trying to put all the furniture and burn them so they could go and kill them or whatever,\" \"They hid there for 27 hours. You can imagine having a 3-year-old and young baby, that is unimaginable.\"",

BoQ posted a statutory net profit after tax of $124 million for the year ended August 31 (compared with $409 million a year earlier). The bank cut its final dividend to 21 cents per share (down from last year's 24 cents apiece). Net interest margin fell to 1.69% (compared with a restated 2022 number of 1.71%). This is the difference between the rate at which the bank borrows money and lends it to customers. The bank recorded a one-off impairment charge of more than $300 million, which also hit its earnings. BoQ expects revenue and margin pressures to continue into the current financial year, reflecting credit growth and competition, while flagging a possible low single-digit cost growth. \"A very weak result, with the likelihood of further negative revisions to FY24 consensus expectations,\" analysts at Citi said in a note, adding that the management would have a \"tough task in building credibility in their medium-term productivity story.\" \"We recognise that this has been a difficult year for our shareholders and take accountability for the operational risk failings,\" BOQ CEO Patrick Allaway said in a statement. By 12:40pm AEDT, Bank of Queensland's share price was down 5.3% to $5.47.",

There's been the flight credits saga, delayed and cancelled flights, customer service complaints, a class action, and an ACCC investigation over allegations it sold tickets for cancelled flights. But that was only the beginning â on top of Alan Joyce's early exit, the High Court's ruling that Qantas illegally sacked 1,700 ground crew, and the multi-million-dollar payout for Joyce and its executives disclosed in its annual report. And it was just two weeks ago today that Richard Goyder, along with CEO Vanessa Hudson and Qantas' general counsel Andrew Finch, appeared at a Senate inquiry into the federal government's blocking of additional Qatar Airways flights. It was in that fiery hearing that Richard Goyder said not once, but twice, that he had the support of Qantas shareholders ( despite shareholders withdrawing their support for him a day earlier, and putting the rest of the board on notice ). As the popular saying goes, timing is everything â so why has Richard Goyder made the announcement now, when his exit isn't until sometime next year? The ABC's senior business correspondent Peter Ryan has unpacked what the timing means, how it will impact next month's annual general meeting in Melbourne, and how Qantas might move forward. You can watch his full assessment of the situation below:",

The TWU's statement references the High Court's unanimous ruling that Qantas acted illegally when it sacked about 1,700 ground crew and replaced them with contractors during the COVID-19 pandemic. The union says Mr Goyder should follow former CEO Alan Joyce in an early exit from the airline this year. TWU national secretary Michael Kaine believes Mr Goyder should depart sooner rather than later so he doesn't escape accountability, and allow for a total governance reset at the airline. \"This announcement is an attempt by Goyder to leave in a dignified manner with another year's pay in his pocket, after presiding over the largest case of illegal sackings in Australian history,\" Mr Kaine said. \"This isn't genuine board renewal, this is just shuffling the deckchairs. We need to put an end to illegal conduct being blindly rubber-stamped by a board that fails to scrutinise the CEO who is treated as their equal by having a place on the board. \"With no worker representation, Qantas governance has ignored the needs of the workforce and decimated jobs and standards. \" A fresh start for Qantas governance requires a new board composition that excludes the CEO and embeds a worker representative to avoid the repeat of colossal errors of judgement being repeated.\"",

Zane Duursma is a hybrid forward, tall and strong in the air and on the lead but just as deadly when the ball hits the deck. Duursma is an intelligent and skilful player who can also work his defenders over with his impressive tank. Duursma kicked a mountain of goals this year for both Vic Country and the Gippsland Power, and by the end of the season was probably the hottest player in the Coates League. He can float in and out of games, but can be absolutely devastating with only a handful of touches. He's also flagged an interest in moving into the midfield later in his career, but for the first few years at least Duursma will be a dangerous half-forward, a tough match-up for the opposition due to his wide range of abilities. The top five in this year's draft looms large for clubs on the look out for a touch of class.",

I don't think it's miles away, but it's not going to be enough. If I know Peter Bell and Fremantle, they will be waiting to see what Collingwood get back for Taylor Adams and will then be asking for both that and pick 19. That is probably too far the other way, but if a deal is to be done it will probably end up somewhere in the middle of that. There have also been reports that Freo are trying to stack up 2024 picks for a crack at some big-name recruits â Logan McDonald is the one most commonly mentioned â so perhaps that is something they might ask for from Collingwood.
