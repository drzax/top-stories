Rallies were held in Sydney and Melbourne over the last two nights in support of Palestinians. The president of the Zionist Federation of Australi a, Jeremy Leibler, said some of the slogans being chanted at the Sydney demonstration were unacceptable. “I’m terrified when I see these marches through the city that are not holding candles and calling for peace as we see from rallies in the Jewish community when things have flared up in the Middle East,” he told ABC Radio Melbourne. “What we’re seeing is violent protests.” Mr Leibler said the response from Australian political leaders so far has been heartening. “I think we’ve had strong, very principled support – bipartisan support – both from the prime minister, from [opposition leader] Peter Dutton, and both at the state leadership levels as well,” he said. “So there should be. As there was after 9/11.” President of the Palestine Advocacy Network, Nasser Mashni, said he was disappointed by some of the language used at the pro-Palestinian demonstrations. “It’s entirely unacceptable. There is no room in our movement for antisemitism, any level of racism, Islamophobia, whatever,” he said. “Our struggle is an anti-colonial struggle for self-determination for all peoples in the holy land.” However, he said the move to project the Israeli flag on the Sydney Opera House was hurtful for Australians with a Palestinian background. “I’m Australian too, why don’t my children matter? When the [Sydney] Opera House is lit up in the Israeli flag there was an opportunity for Australia to have a moment of bringing together all peoples to say all children matter,” he said. “Both the flags could have been there.” Meanwhile, Victoria Police is investigating reports of antisemitic threats made in South Yarra yesterday. Police said the occupants of a car threatened a man on Toorak Road about 4pm yesterday.",

Nicholas Blanford, a non-resident senior fellow with the Atlantic Council's Middle East Programs, told ABC News Radio Hezbollah was a very real and formidable threat to Israel. \"It's a very close ally of the Hamas movement, so what is going in Gaza now has a direct impact on Hezbollah,\" he said. While the two groups are different the two share many similarities especially when it comes to shared hostility towards Israel. \"In fact, the unprecedented operation Hamas conducted on Saturday breaking out of the Gaza, and entering the Israeli settlements around Gaza was straight out of Hezbollah's playbook,\" he said speaking from Beirut. \"A massive rocket barrage, infiltration on mass across the border to cause as much damage and chaos as possible inside Israel. \"Hezbollah have been training since 2007 but in this case it was Hamas which put it into practice with deadly effect.\" But he noted Hezbollah faced constraints with shots still being called by Iran, so if the group was told to go to all-out war with Israel they would. But he also said he wasn’t certain Hezbollah would want to face an all-out conflict knowing it would erode its “potent capabilities” further down the road.
