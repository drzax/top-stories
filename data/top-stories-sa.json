He said he has been shocked at the \"bizarre\" and \"nutty\" conspiracy theories surrounding the ballot. \"We run one of the most transparent voting systems in the world,\" he said. \"A hundred thousand members of the community, who are the eyes and the ears of the community — thousands of scrutineers who watch everything that we do. \"And please, if you've got a question ask a member of the AEC – don't believe that nonsense online.\" Mr Rodgers said whether the result of the referendum is known tonight will depend on how close the outcome is. \"If there is a very large margin, we'll know the results of that this evening,\" he said. \"[But] we've had something like 2 million postal vote applications – those votes have to come back before we can count them.\" Lines have formed outside polling booths across Canberra this morning, with two thirds of Canberrans expected to cast their votes in person today. About 119,000 Canberrans – or just over a third – have already pre-polled, in addition to the 25,000 that applied for a postal vote.",

White phosphorus is a chemical element that ignites when it comes into contact with air, making it useful for producing aerial markers or smokescreens, but also dangerous to civilian populations as it can cause serious burns. Its use as a weapon against civilians is illegal under the 1983 Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons. \"We deny those allegations. We have not made use of white phosphorus — not in Gaza and not in Lebanon,\" an IDF spokesman said in a statement. The accusation was levelled by the international NGO Human Rights Watch, which published an investigation into the reported use of white phosphorus munitions in Lebanon and Gaza on October 10 and 11, respectively. It cited analysis of video footage as well as interviews with two people who witnessed the strikes. Israel has previously pledged to limit its use of white phosphorus after coming under heavy criticism for firing shells containing the chemical over Gaza in 2008.",
