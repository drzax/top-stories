But that won’t stop the former president and his supporters from characterising the investigation as a witch hunt and an attempt to interfere in the 2024 election. Trump is still considered the leading candidate for the Republican presidential nomination, while Biden has declared that he’s also running for office again.",

Two women were seen taking the baby from Ipswich Hospital on Monday and putting her into a white Suzuki, which has since been located. An Amber Alert has been issued. Queensland Police Commissioner Katarina Carroll told ABC Radio Brisbane this morning that detectives are looking for the baby's mother 18-year-old Khloe Bornen, who is believed to be with the baby. \"We have many detectives, many uniform officers … just not patrolling and looking and investigating but searching on social media. \"I call upon the public — if you can, if you know anything, please contact police.\" Khloe is described as Caucasian and around 165 centimetres tall with a proportionate build and brown hair. Police urged anyone with information to call 131 564, or triple-0 if the details are life-threatening. West Moreton Health chief executive Hannah Bloch in a statement said the baby was not taken by a \"third party\". \"The mother discharged herself and her child soon after giving birth,\" she said. \"I am disclosing this information in the public interest so women can continue to feel safe giving birth at Ipswich Hospital. \"This was an isolated incident and the healthcare provided to mother and baby is not in question.\"",

She says critics of her toplessness affirms that she is, in fact, a woman, as a man would not face similar pushback. She says she had \"zero intention of trying to be vulgar or be profane in anyway\", adding that she covered her nipples with her hands in the video \"just to play it safe\". Montoya says she will be making a public statement on the situation \"soon\".",

Avatar 4 is now slated to hit theatres in December 2029, with Avatar 5 set to arrive in December 2031! If those dates hold, the Avatar film series will have stretched across the first four decades of the century.

OnePath is a superannuation trustee owned by Insignia Financial, previously known as IOOF, and has approximately 700,000 members and $35 billion in funds under management. It has been hit with infringement notices totalling $1.46 million for failing to direct 125 member contributions to a MySuper product from mid-last year onwards. \"In addition to today's enforcement action, APRA is closely monitoring OPC to ensure any members who suffered financial losses as a result of these breaches are fully compensated as soon as possible,\" APRA Deputy Chair Margaret Cole said.",
