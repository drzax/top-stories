              "plaintext": "How does an interest rate hike influence inflation in fuel.. if demand for fuel drops, OPEC will only reduce supply to maintain higher prices. This is totally outside Australian households control - Andrew. Hey Andrew, It's not an easy one to wrap your head around, and it's certainly an arguable point because in the short-term, higher petrol prices are inflationary. This line of thinking was actually mentioned by Treasury secretary (and RBA board member) Steven Kennedy at Senate estimates earlier today. In a nutshell, he said higher oil prices (and higher petrol prices as a result) will put upward pressure on inflation in the near term, but those higher prices could work to reduce growth. \"It [higher oil prices] will increase headline inflation by raising petrol prices, [but] on the other hand it may well reduce growth and see other prices fall,\" he said. It sounds counterintuitive, but AMP Capital's chief economist Shane Oliver broke it down earlier this week. He said a $12 weekly increase in fuel means that there would be $12 a week less available for households to spend elsewhere, which will then likely reduce underlying inflation pressures, but add to the risk of a recession. Simply put, higher petrol prices are going to force households with already-stretched budgets to re-evaluate how they allocate their money so they can afford to fill up — and it's the money that isn't being spent elsewhere that will reduce inflationary pressures. To give a really generic, totally hypothetical example, let's assume I spend $100 a month to fill up my car — but with higher petrol prices I'm having to pay $150 a month. That means I need to find somewhere in my monthly spending to budget an extra $50 to afford that price increase, so I might choose to cut back on buying a $5 coffee every day at work. As a result, I'm spending less on takeaway. If a lot of people do something similar to me and spend less on takeaway too, that will flow through to the economy and have an impact on inflation. It's not a perfect example by any stretch, but it speaks broadly to what Steven Kennedy and Shane Oliver were referencing. Whether higher fuel prices will actually have this effect in reality though is something we'll have to wait to see play out in real time.",

In the 14 weeks from July 1 to October 1 this year, Woolworths has seen a 5.3% increase in its total group sales compared to the same time last year. In dollar values, that comes in at $17.2 billion. It's slightly less than what analysts had predicted (they thought there'd be a 5.5% increase) but CEO Brad Banducci says it's a \"solid\" result in light of inflation moderating. He says deflation for fruits, vegetables and meats has led to lower input costs, which have led to \"lower retail prices\" in its food businesses (that is, its supermarkets). \"Looking ahead, we have strong plans in place for the key Christmas and holiday trading period,\" he said. \"While sales trends in October have remained broadly in line with the trend lines in Q1, the trading environment remains uncertain and value for money remains a key focus for our customers across all our businesses. \"Keeping our team safe and helping all our customers have an inspirational and affordable festive season remains our top priority .\" The release of Woolworths' first quarter results comes ahead of their AGM tomorrow morning.",

The federal government charges 49 cents a litre on petrol purchased at the bowser, as part of a fuel excise. The previous Coalition government temporarily halved the tax in March last year for six months, after Russia's invasion of Ukraine caused a massive global spike in oil prices. The current government opted not to extend the excise cut when it expired last September, with government estimates suggesting the temporary cut resulted in about $5.6 billion of lost tax revenue during those six months. But when asked today if the government was looking at reducing the excise to ease cost-of-living pressures, Mr Chalmers said it's currently not on the table. \"Obviously in future budgets we will contemplate what measures are necessary in our economy consistent with our strict approach to fiscal discipline,\" he replied. \"But it's not something we have been working on now.\"",
