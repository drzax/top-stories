The ASX 200 index was up just 0.1% in the first half hour to 7,321 points and the All Ords up just 6 points to 7,532. This morning's best gains have come from the energy sector, with a couple of coal miners in the top ten — Whitehaven (+2.3%) and New Hope (+1.9%). The tech sector was also up, with WiseTech Global (+1.7%) and REA Group (+1.4%) amongst the biggest gains. The financial sector continued to edge higher (+0.2%) with all four major banks posting modest gains. But the large mining sector weighed on the ASX, with BHP and Rio Tinto broadly flat, and suppliers of commodities needed for batteries, such as lithium and nickel, generally getting pummeled. Core Lithium had dropped 13.2%, with Sayona Mining and Lake Resources down 5.9%, Liontown down 4.6% and Pilbara Minerals off 4.3%.",

The key bit locally is the June quarter Consumer Price Index, to be released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics on Wednesday at 11:30am AEST. Economists are typically expecting the headline number to fall to 6.2%, with the RBA's preferred 'trimmed mean' measure of inflation easing to 6%, according to a Refinitiv survey. The consensus is broadly that a number much above those levels will all but guarantee another interest rate hike on August 1, while a number in line with or below those forecasts is more likely to see the RBA stay on hold at a 4.1% cash rate. A rise in rates would be bad for many stocks — it lifts the valuation benchmark for one thing, but also increases the prospect of an Australian recession, which is not great for the earnings outlook. Ahead of those key numbers (which I'll have more about shortly) the ASX SPI 200 futures are up 0.4% to 7,300 points. That followed a quiet Friday session on Wall Street, where the Dow Jone Industrial Average and S & P 500 were almost dead flat, and the Nasdaq down just slightly. I suggest grabbing a coffee, or another one, because you might need it to get through what could be quite a dull day on the markets.",
