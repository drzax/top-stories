But White House officials, from the president down, have been talking more and more about their desire to see \"pauses\" in the war. It's likely to be raised as a priority by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken when he meets Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. He's on his way to Israel now. White House national security spokesman John Kirby briefed reporters here in Washington earlier: \"We're really not just talking about, like, one pause. \"What we're trying to do is explore the idea of as many pauses as might be necessary to continue to get aid out, and to continue to work to get people out safely, including hostages. \"The president already worked on one such pause when we were able to get those two Americans out. And that's what we're kind of looking at.\" On Wednesday (local time), Joe Biden voiced support for a humanitarian pause after a protester interrupted a speech he was giving in Minnesota. “As a rabbi, I need you to call for a ceasefire right now,\" yelled the protester, who later identified herself to reporters as Rabbi Jessica Rosenberg from the anti-Zionist Jewish Voice for Peace group. \"I think we need a pause,\" Biden replied, according to a pool reporter at the event. \"A pause means give time to get the prisoners out.\" Yesterday, Foreign Minister Penny Wong reiterated Australia's call for humanitarian pauses .",

Australia's Department of Foreign Affairs (DFAT) says 65 people including Australian citizens, permanent residents and their families are still stuck inside Gaza, after 23 managed to flee into Egypt on Wednesday (local time). Two of the people still stuck inside Gaza are Abdullah Dahlan and his wife Samah. Abdullah went to the border crossing on Wednesday but decided to go back into Gaza when Egyptian officials wouldn't let his wife leave. She's a Palestinian with a visa for Australia, but officials said she had to stay. ABC staff visited Abdullah and Samah inside Gaza today. He told us he thought he was going to die trying to escape. \"I had to risk my life going to the border,\" he says. \"I had to find a way of transport, someone to drive me there. And in these circumstances, they don't want to go because they're scared. \"Bombing is everywhere, rockets falling over your head, warplanes, they never stop. \"It was very frightening yesterday, but I had to do it because I wanted to get out.\" Abdallah says his time in Gaza during the war has been a nightmare and he doesn't know if he'll ever return. \"After what I've seen, I don't know, I'm really not sure,\" he says. \"It's horrible what I see here, it's dreadful, something that can't be described. \"You only have to look at the streets. People are everywhere looking for a piece of bread, they want water, [there's] no electricity, no fuel,\" he says. \"Children are suffering so much, it's heartbreaking. You can't get milk for them. \"If you just look the streets, people sleep in the streets.\" Foreign Minister Penny Wong has said it could take some weeks to have all Australians evacuated.",

The Israeli army said it responded to launches from Lebanon toward Israel with air strikes on Hezbollah targets, along with tank and artillery fire. Lebanon's National News Agency on Thursday said four people were killed near the southern village of Hula during Israeli shelling. The heavily armed Shi'ite Islamist group said in a statement its fighters launched 19 simultaneous strikes on Israeli army positions in Israel using guided missiles, artillery and other weapons. Hezbollah said two drones packed with explosives struck an Israeli army command position in the disputed Shebaa Farms area at the border. Israeli shelling struck the outskirts of Khiyam town some 6 kilometres from the border, slightly injuring one civilian, the town's mayor, Ali Rashed, told Reuters. \"His house caught fire and people are putting it out,\" he said. \"The intensity of the shelling was higher than previous days. The shelling and the counter shelling were more than any previous level and included the whole area.\" Lebanon's National News Agency reported Israeli shells hit various areas of the south along the border.

Its monthly listings report shows that the number of residential properties listed for sale eased by 0.9% in October to 243,221. The move down was driven by old listings clearing (either via sale or being withdrawn from the market), with those properties listed for more than 180 days dropping 5.8%. In contrast, new listings (less than 30 days old) jumped by 2.7% last month to 79,722. And it seems that distressed sales are making up a greater proportion of listings, climbing 5.2% to 5,521 homes currently on the market. That's about 2.3% of homes for sale being advertised as distressed. Distressed sales rose last month everywhere except South Australia and the Northern Territory. By far the biggest monthly and annual jump has been in the ACT, albeit from extremely low levels and with a small sample size. Over the past year, Tasmania, the Northern Territory and Victoria have also seen double-digit increases in distressed sales. SQM's managing director Louis Christopher says a continued increase in distressed sales, which are often forced by financial pressures, would be a negative for property prices.",
