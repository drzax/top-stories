The figures show approvals for new houses as well as apartments and townhouses are at their lowest levels in more than a decade. Housing Industry Association senior economist Tom Devitt said that leaves both the residential construction industry and those relying on it to increase housing supply facing a dire outlook. \"On a quarterly basis, this leaves detached house approvals 15.4 per cent lower than the same time the previous year, and multi-units down by 38.9 per cent ,\" he wrote. \"This continues the long-lagged response of Australian homebuyers to the RBA's interest rate hiking cycle, with further declines expected in the coming months. \"The combination of construction cost blowouts, labour uncertainties, increased compliance costs and taxes on investors has seen approvals for multi-units fall. \"These disappointing approvals numbers are occurring as population growth surges with the return of overseas migrants, students and tourists. \"This imbalance will see the affordability and rental crisis deteriorate further.\" The HIA said, over the past three months, seasonally adjusted building approvals had fallen from the levels seen a year earlier in every state and territory, with the biggest drops in the ACT (-49.8%), Victoria (-35.3%), NSW (28.7%) and the NT (-27.3%). CBA economist Belinda Allen said the picture isn't nearly so grim outside the home building sector. \"Outside of new residential approvals, the value of non-residential approvals rose by 13.5%/mth in April and is up by 29.8%/yr ,\" she noted. \"The strength partly due to a weak base year, but looking at the three month moving change also shows a lift in entertainment, health care, and other commercial buildings. \" Residential alterations & additions were down by 1.2%/mth and 2.7%/yr .\"",

However it's been heavily rumoured that both will enter in the lead actor categories. That helps clear Snook's pathway a little, as award show favourite Jennifer Coolidge is usually nominated in the supporting actress category for her work on The White Lotus. Things gets a bit crowded in the lead actor category, though. Brian Cox and Jeremy Strong are always nominated for lead actor, but bumping Culkin up might result in HBO deciding to enter Cox in the supporting category instead. There is also huge competition from other shows, with Bob Odenkirk (Better Call Saul) and Pedro Pascal (The Last of Us) no doubt also getting a nom. One thing is for sure though: Succession will definitely be sweeping the awards.",

The Thick of It is a dark comedy about the workings of Westminster and centres around the fictional Department of Social Affairs and its incompetent staff.
