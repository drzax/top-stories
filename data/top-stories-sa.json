The Greens have threatened to withhold support for the government's plan to double the concessional tax rate on super balances over $3 million, unless Labor agrees to pay super on paid parental leave. That change would affect 0.5% of taxpayers and will raise about $2 billion a year. Finance Minister Katy Gallagher told News Breakfast that the current proposal is sensible. \"We recognise women retire with less retirement savings than men,\" she said. \"This is one of the areas where we can make a practical difference, but it does come with a fiscal hit to the budget and we've got to manage a whole lot of other pressures as well.\"",
