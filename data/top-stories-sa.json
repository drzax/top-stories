The former consumer watchdog boss will dig into the thorny issue through a union-backed inquiry set up by the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU). The union says the inquiry will examine: The extent of price gouging facing working people on essential items The disproportionate effect experienced by cohorts of workers and vulnerable groups The effect of price gouging on the safety and mental health of workers providing essential goods and services The ACTU has been concerned excessive corporate profits are doing more to fuel sky-high inflation than rising wages, as AAP reports. Inflation started surging last year and has triggered a series of interest rate rises to bring it under control, with the higher borrowing costs and elevated cost of living putting Australian households under financial pressure. The role of corporate profits in the inflation outbreak has been debated, with Treasury and Reserve Bank analysis suggesting profits were not significantly driving up prices, with the exception of the mining sector.",

But it warns that a \"soft landing is possible but not certain\" for the economy as the Reserve Bank tries to bring inflation down to its target of between 2 to 3 per cent. \"The key risk to a soft-landing scenario is that inflation is more sticky than generally expected and the Reserve Bank of Australia has to hike interest rates more strongly.\" \"That could cause a sharper economic downturn and larger rise in unemployment.\" S & P Asia Pacific chief economist Louis Kuijs says the RBA's decision to pause official rates at 4.1 per cent shows it doesn't want to trigger a recession by lifting rates too much. The unemployment rate is near 50-year lows of 3.5 per cent and Mr Kuijs says the labour market strength has been driven by demand for workers in the services sector, which employs 80 per cent of workers, and makes up two-thirds of GDP. \"The labour market tightness may also reflect some labour hoarding, as firms worry they may not easily find new employees if they let some go,\" he says. S & P expects the economy to expand by 1.4 per cent this year and unemployment to rise moderately. That's more optimistic than the RBA's forecast of 0.9 per cent.",

In its results announcement, the insurer warned of challenges posed by high inflation and the financial impact of adverse weather events (ie. natural disasters). Suncorp's lower-than-expected dividend also weighed on its share price. Australia's second-largest insurer announced a fully franked final dividend of 27 cents per share (which was lower than consensus estimate of 40 cents, and Citi's estimates of 39 cents). \"The operating environment remains challenging,\" Suncorp said, forecasting an insurance gross written premium growth of around 10% in fiscal year 2024 (compared with a 10.8% growth seen in previous year for combined Australia and New Zealand units). \"The dividend will likely disappoint some and the guidance, while largely as expected, suggests a relatively tough 1H24 with the lingering issues in motor inflation we expected,\" analysts at Citi wrote in a research note. Lower end of shareholder payout, higher costs ahead Suncorp's full-year dividend payout ratio was 60% of its cash earnings, at the lower end of its range of 60% to 80%. Analysts at Citi said they believed the ordinary payout reflects a significant drain on the capital of the company. Suncorp posted annual cash earnings of $1.25 billion, compared with $673 million a year earlier, helped by improved underlying margins and a significant turnaround in investment returns. Net gain from yields and investment markets was $724 million for the year, compared with a loss of $190 million in 2022, the company said in a statement. The insurer also flagged an increase in costs related to the $4.9 billion divestment of banking unit to ANZ Group to between $575 million and $600 million (up from $500 million) after the ACCC blocked the deal. - Reuters",
