However, just to be on the safe side, Alenquer has just been trotted up before the vets after arriving on-course, to make sure everything is sound. This means there will be 23 runners for the Cup at 3pm AEDT. This also means that Oliver — who will retire next month at the Perth Carnival — will finish his career with three Melbourne Cup wins (on Doriemus, Media Puzzle and Fiorente ), one behind the record-holders, Harry White and Bobbie Lewis.",

But the Israeli leader reiterated his country's rejection of a ceasefire without the release of all people being held captive in the Hamas-ruled Palestinian enclave. Mr Netanyahu made the comments in an interview with the US ABC News. \"Well, there'll be no ceasefire, no general ceasefire in Gaza without the release of our hostages,\" he said. \"As far as tactical little pauses — an hour here, an hour there — we've had them before. \"I suppose we'll check the circumstances, in order to enable goods, humanitarian goods, to come in, or our hostages, individual hostages, to leave.\" He was also asked who should govern Gaza after fighting is over. \"I think Israel will for an indefinite period ... have the overall security responsibility because we've seen what happens when we don't have that security responsibility,\" he said. Both Israel and Hamas have rebuffed mounting international pressure for a ceasefire. Israel says Hamas should release the hostages first; Hamas says it will not free them or stop fighting while Gaza is under assault. Reuters",

Israel's military and police said the four were part of a West Bank cell that was directed by Hamas and who were behind numerous shooting attacks. The Palestinian Health Ministry said they were killed in the western West Bank city of Tulkarm, close to the boundary with Israel, after Israeli forces opened fire on their car. In a separate incident, the ministry said an 18-year-old Palestinian was later killed by Israeli forces in the West Bank city of Bethlehem. Prior to the latest incidents, at least 155 Palestinians had been killed in the West Bank since October 7, according to Palestinian Health Ministry figures. The worsening violence comes after more than 18 months of bloodshed that has fuelled fears the West Bank could erupt into a bigger conflict and become a new front in the Israel-Hamas war. An Israeli border police officer was killed in Jerusalem earlier after she was stabbed by a 16-year-old Palestinian attacker, according to the police. Reuters",

Eliyahu said in a social media post: \"It is clear to anyone who is sensible that the nuclear remark was metaphorical.\" But he added: \"A strong and disproportionate response to terrorism is definitely required, which will clarify to the Nazis and their supporters that terrorism is not worthwhile.\" A spokesperson for Hamas, an Islamist group that advocates Israel's destruction, said Eliyahu represented \"unprecedented criminal Israeli terrorism [that] constitutes a danger to the entire region and the world\".",

Profitability has remained elusive a s WeWork grapples with its expensive leases and corporate clients cancelling because some employees work from home. Paying for space consumed 74% of WeWork's revenue in the second quarter of 2023. The company reported estimated assets and liabilities ranging from $US10 billion to $US50 billion, according to a bankruptcy filing. \"WeWork could use provisions of the US bankruptcy code to rid itself of onerous leases,\" law firm Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft LLP said in a note to landlords on its website in August. Some landlords are bracing for a significant impact. Under its founder Adam Neumann, WeWork grew to be the most valuable US startup, worth $US47 billion. It attracted investments from bluechip investors, including SoftBank and venture capital firm Benchmark, as well as the backing of major Wall Street Banks, including JPMorgan Chase. Just last week, a source told the Wall Street Journal the company was planning to file for bankruptcy. WeWork has around a dozen offices around Australia, but has been gradually closing them, with its Brisbane CBD office wound down last month. —with Reuters",

The ASX 200 index was down 0.4% to 6,970 points by 12:45pm AEDT (after rising for five straight days). Globally, investors are also eyeing upcoming policy speeches by at least nine US Federal Reserve members during the week, including its chair Jerome Powell on November 9, for further clues on the Fed's monetary policy. Shares in Origin Energy rose 0.8%, after a proxy advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) recommended investors to vote in favour of a Brookfield-led consortium's $10.5 billion bid for the power producer. Westpac shares fell 2.8%, effectively wiping out most of yesterday's gains. It comes a day after Westpac announced a $1.5 billion share buyback, and reported that its annual profit jumped 26% to $7.2 billion.",

Proxy advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) has recommended investors vote in favour of a Brookfield-led consortium's $10.5 billion takeover bid for Origin Energy. The offer has been rejected by pension fund AustralianSuper, which is Origin's largest shareholder. Toronto-based Brookfield and Sydney-headquartered EIG Partners has offered $9.53 per share for Origin Energy. Shareholders are due to vote on the bid on November 23. 75% of votes must be cast in favour of the offer for it to be approved. \"The transaction offers shareholders a cash exit at a premium in exchange for surrendering the payoff of a potential successful energy transition for the company,\" the ISS report said. AustralianSuper (which holds a 15.03% stake) has said it believes the consortium's bid substantially \"undervalues\" Origin and will vote against the offer. Brookfield will take ownership of Origin's energy markets business if the vote is in favour of the bid, while EIG's MidOcean Energy will gain a 27.5% stake in Australia Pacific LNG (APLNG). If the shareholder vote fails, the Brookfield-led consortium said last week it has a back-up plan for an off-market takeover that would require the minimum acceptance of 50.1% of the register and give it control of Origin's board. In that scenario, EIG will own Origin and sell the energy markets business to Brookfield, meaning remaining shareholders, including AustralianSuper, will own only APLNG.",
