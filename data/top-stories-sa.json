Not surprisingly, Federal Treasurer Jim Chalmers has welcomed the figures. \"Today’s figures from the ABS show the price pressures in our economy continue to moderate in welcome ways,\" he says. \"It’s pleasing that inflation is moderating, and while we would prefer it moderate more quickly to ease pressure on household budgets, we are making progress. \" \"Inflation both here and around the world is remaining higher than we’d like for longer than we'd like, but it’s tracking downwards in the right direction.\" And Mr Chalmers has pointed to the government's cost of living relief measures in the budget, which include rent and energy bill assistance. \"The Government’s number one priority is getting on top of the inflation challenge and providing cost-of-living relief for Australians families.\" \"The cost-of-living relief policies are directly reducing price pressures in the economy by three quarters of a percentage point this financial year. \" The budget surplus for the 2022-23 is expected to come in at around $20 billion - nearly five times the $4.2 billion predicted in May's budget. However, the Treasurer has so far ruled out additional cost of living relief measures.",

The odds of a rate hike by the Reserve Bank next week have dropped, with the market betting on a 29 per cent chance of a 0.25 per cent rise, and a 71 per cent chance that rates will stay on hold. The Australian dollar slumped and the Australian market increased to a five-month high. The dollar fell nearly 1 per cent to 67.29 US cents because investors think the pull back in inflation buys the RBA more time to consider how the economy is tracking before it pulls the rate lever again. Rate hikes boost currencies because they increase the cost of money. The ASX 200 extended its gains by 0.8 per cent with investors also betting on a pause, although real estate firms are lower. Consumer staples did well on the news, but it's banks and big miners that are driving the market today. Banks extended their gains after the numbers came out. ANZ is up 1.5 per cent, while Westpac has put on 1.6 per cent. Even though banks make money from interest rate rises, higher borrowing costs also mean a likely rise in loan defaults.",
