Its shares were halted after the developer said its founder Hui Ka Yan is being investigated over suspected \"illegal crimes\" and is under police watch. It's leading to more concerns from creditors about its ability to pay back enormous amounts of debt. Here is some copy from the news wire service Reuters: The world's most indebted property developer with more than $300 billion in total liabilities did not say whether Hui Ka Yan was still in a position to run the company, or what crimes he is being investigated for. The news signals for the first time that authorities could hold the billionaire Evergrande founder accountable for the developer's financial woes, which have ripped through the property sector that accounts for roughly a quarter of the Chinese economy. Deepening turmoil in China's debt-laden property sector is threatening to undermine Beijing's efforts to get the sputtering economy back on more solid footing, and raising fears among investors of a spillover into the country's banking system. The latest development is a major blow to China's once top-selling developer that has lurched from one crisis to another since its cash squeeze became public in 2021 and it defaulted on its offshore debt obligations later that year.",

Elon Musk's Tesla is being sued by the US version of FairWork for \"tolerating widespread and ongoing racial harassment of its Black employees\" from at least 2015 until today. The lawsuit was just filed by the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. The regulator's suit contains some very concerning allegations that workers in its California factory endured racial abuse, stereotyping, and vilificaton including a range of racial slurs. \"Slurs were used casually and openly in high-traffic areas and at worker hubs,\" they allege. It further alleges that workers faced graffiti around the factory that depicted racial abuse, \"including variations of the N-word, swastikas, threats, and nooses, on desks and other equipment\". This graffiti was even allegedly found on new electric cars as they were rolling off the production line. Further, it found people who raised objections to this, faced retaliation including being fired. The case was lodged by the EEOC's office in the tech hub of Silicon Valley and is being led by former FBI lawyer James Baker. Tesla has been contacted for comment. This suit follows another lawsuit by Californian-based regulators about similiar issues. Earlier this year, Tesla agreed to pay one worker several million dollars after a federal jury found it failed to prevent severe racial harassment at the Californian plant.
