At least 500 people, most of them foreigners or dual nationals and their dependents passed through Rafah, the only crossing that does not border Israel, Egyptian security sources said. Evacuations through the crossing were suspended on Saturday and Sunday after an Israeli strike on an ambulance that was heading to Rafah. Egyptian security sources said Egypt was continuing to press for increased aid and fuel into the strip and security for ambulances. Jordan's foreign ministry said 262 Jordanians were evacuated on Tuesday, out of a total of 569 that had been stuck in Gaza following the outbreak of fighting there. Canada said 59 of its citizens, permanent residents and family members were evacuated. Nineteen Gazans needing medical treatment were also allowed through, a medical source said, to join dozens of others who are being treated in Egyptian hospitals. Other countries with citizens cleared to leave on Tuesday included Romania, Germany, Moldova, Ukraine, the Philippines and France, according to the Gaza border authority. Reporting with Reuters",

White House national security spokesperson John Kirby told reporters that Israel and the US are friends and do not have to agree on every single issue. Israel has so far been vague about its long-term plans for Gaza if it defeats Hamas. In some of the first direct comments on the subject, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel would seek to have security responsibility for Gaza \"for an indefinite period\". But officials said Israel is not interested in governing the enclave. Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said that after the war was finished, neither Israel nor Hamas would rule Gaza. Simcha Rothman, a politician in Netanyahu's religious-nationalist coalition, in a social media post called for \"full Israeli control\" of the strip. Israeli Foreign Minister Eli Cohen told the Wall Street Journal that Israel wants the territory to be under an international coalition, including the US, European Union and Muslim-majority countries, or administered by local Gaza political leaders. Israel pulled its troops and settlers from the Gaza Strip in 2005, and two years later Hamas took power there.",

The decision by the Reserve Bank to lift the key \"cash rate\" continues to reverberate — and there's the potential for another hike before Christmas as the central bank continues to fight inflation, which is currently running at +5.4% annually. The ASX futures index has it down a point to 6,989. It'll open at 10am AEDT. On US indices, the blue chip Dow Jones index of mega-companies was up +0.17%, the broader S & P 500 was +0.41% higher and the tech-loaded Nasdaq lifted +1.15%. More rate reaction all day as well as the release of one of the mot important economic and social indicators of all: life expectancy data. However you get started for the day, enjoy it!",
