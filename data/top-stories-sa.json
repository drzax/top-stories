While thousands of people have died in southern Israel and the Gaza Strip since Hamas's October 7 attacks, recent violence in the north has also claimed lives — two in Israel and at least 11 in Lebanon. Since the Hamas attacks, \"everything has changed,\" said evacuated kibbutz member Lea Raivitz, 68, still stunned by the onslaught. One day after the shock attack, her kibbutz Bar'am, located right by the Lebanese border, moved out with all its people — from newborns to those aged in their 90s — in only its second evacuation since it was founded in 1949. \"It's shaken all of our beliefs,\" Raivitz told AFP, speaking at their temporary new home, a hotel in Tiberias on the western shores of the Sea of Galilee. Communities within 2 kilometres of the Lebanese border were evacuated to state-funded guesthouses on Monday. The Israel-Lebanon border area has remained largely at peace since a devastating war in 2006 between Israel and Hezbollah. Residents of kibbutz Bar'am who have lived there for decades say that unrest over the years has come in cycles, and they are used to seeing Hezbollah posts and flags from their homes on the other side of the border. But some told AFP that their sense of security had been all but shattered following the October 7 rampage by Hamas, the worst attack in the country's history. \"We're all traumatised, we're all scared,\" said kibbutz resident Angela Yantian, 67. \"I didn't think that sort of thing could have ever happened.\" Some kibbutzniks said Israel's sacrifice and the fight ahead are worth it if they bring greater security for Israel in the future. \"Every terror organisation needs to know that we will deal with them when the time is right for us,\" said Tsachi Shaked, 51. \"If the right time is now, then we will need to do it now.\" AFP",
