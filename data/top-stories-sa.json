Private 2nd Class Travis King entered North Korea while on a tour of the Joint Security Area (JSA) on the heavily fortified border between the two Koreas, becoming the first American detained in the North in nearly five years. The North's official Korean Central News Agency said King told investigators he had decided to enter North Korea because he \"harbored ill feeling against inhuman maltreatment and racial discrimination within the US Army\". The Pentagon on Tuesday said it could not verify alleged comments made by King that North Korean state media reported, but that Washington remained focused on his safe return. \"The department's priority is to bring Private King home, and that we are working through all available channels to achieve that outcome,\" a Pentagon spokesperson said.
