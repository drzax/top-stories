Juliette Touma told Reuters in Gaza by phone from Amman that there were a total of around 19 trucks in Sunday's convoy carrying medical and food supplies. A first convoy of 20 trucks of badly needed supplies had entered Gaza on Saturday through Rafah, which had previously been out of operation after bombardments hit on the Gaza side of the border and amid wrangling over conditions for delivering aid. Distribution of those supplies began on Sunday, but aid officials are still warning of a humanitarian disaster as supplies of food, water and fuel run low. UN officials say at least 100 trucks a day would be required in Gaza to cover urgent needs. Before the outbreak of the most recent conflict, several hundred trucks had been arriving in the enclave daily. Reuters",

The benchmark indices are down around 0.8% in early trade, with the ASX 200 at 6,845 points. Mining and energy are dominating the early falls, with real estate and consumer cyclical stocks also down on fears of an economic slowdown due to higher interest rates persisting for longer. In a clearly 'risk-off' day, the sectors posting solid gains are the more 'defensive' ones of consumer non-cyclicals and healthcare — the kinds of businesses we can't avoid when we're cutting spending. Treasury Wine Estates is one of the ASX 200's top gainers, up 3% to $12.12, after the Australian Government said China is undertaking a five month review into punitive wine tariffs, with a widespread expectation they will be removed early next year. The other top rises around 10:20am AEDT were: Weebit Nano +4% to $3.91 Bellevue Gold +3.7% to $1.555 BlueScope Steel +1.8% to $18.23 ARB Corp +1.8% to $30.81 The biggest falls were for: New Hope Corporation -7.7% to $5.97 Liontown Resources -3.7% to $1.83 Champion Iron -3.5% to $6.06 Pilbara Minerals -3.5% to $3.725 South32 -3% to $3.27",

The first is a speech tomorrow night at a conference hosted by the Commonwealth Bank. The second is an appearance before the Senate in Canberra on Thursday morning. That second appearance is particularly important as it comes the day after the Australian Bureau of Statistics releases its latest inflation data for both the month and quarter of September.
