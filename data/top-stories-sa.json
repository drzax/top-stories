OPEC's decision extended an agreement on crude supply restrictions from this year into 2024, with Saudi Arabia announcing production cuts of 1 million barrels per day, amid frustration at falling oil prices. But senior market analyst at OANDA, Craig Erlam told RN Breakfast he doesn't believe it will drive up inflation globally as the situation currently stands. \"It doesn't [affect us] I don't think at this point in time, and the reason is because the markets have largely shrugged it off, \" he said. \"Like I say, the price of a barrel of oil at times last year was well above $100 a barrel. If we look back at Q2 last year, you can see that a price of barrel of oil, I think at one point even spiked around $130, although it didn't really stay there for very long. \"Going in between, say the fourth quarter of last year and the end of the first quarter this year it's trading between $80 and $90 a barrel. \"Today it's $78 in the aftermath, $77-76 in the aftermath of this announcement, so we should still be seeing disinflation in the oil prices compared to a year ago, so it still should be a disinflationary force. \"But if this is met with other actions by OPEC plus over the coming months that may change.\"",

That was reiterated by Shadow Treasurer Angus Taylor was on News Breakfast earlier this morning, who said the government can no longer blame global events like the war in Ukraine for inflation, and it was the government's fault it was still so high. Host Lisa Millar put that line of thinking to Assistant Treasurer Stephen Jones, who maintains that it would not add to inflation and make the current situation worse. Here's what he said in response: \"Look, you can just contrast what Angus Taylor is saying with the words of the Reserve Bank governor himself, who has said that the budget that the government  handed down three weeks ago was not inflationary. \"I think I prefer the Reserve Bank governor's opinion over Angus Taylor's opinion when it comes to inflation and  interest rates.
