It will require legislation. I'm anticipating early next year for the legislation,\" he says. \"That doesn't mean that we can't, on a voluntary basis, do a lot of this work with the code of practice before parliament does its job of legislating. That's what I want to see happening. \"There's already work going on in some of the sectors I've mentioned. Not enough. I'm working with colleagues to ensure that we get this moving quicker and with more detail.\" Jones says he expects the code of practice will outline what protections are required to be put in place by banks, and when banks should pay compensation or reimbursement if those protections aren't followed.

Local police said a 911 caller reported an active shooter in the Capitol district about 2:30pm local time (4:30am AEST). Officers were on the scene “within seconds”, searching the Senate office buildings and telling political staffers inside to shelter in place. But the local police chief has just held a press conference, where he said they found no signs of a shooting or a shooter. He said local police and partner agencies such as the Secret Service were “prepared for whatever might happen tomorrow”. Mr Trump is scheduled to appear in court at 4pm local time (6am AEST), but it’s not known if he will show up in person or dial in virtually. The courthouse is about a 10-minute walk from the Capitol building, which was stormed by Trump supporters on January 6, 2021.",

The US market was shocked by a credit downgrade from one of the key ratings agencies - meaning it thinks the country is a bit riskier for investors than it was yesterday. That can trigger higher interest payments but the biggest blow is probably to confidence in the market. The ASX futures market is at 7,241 points, down 58 points or -0.8%.
