Some readers say their CBA electronic banking is working, others say it's still down and still others have had access on and off over the morning. Bill 12:54:07 PM Re: the CBA outage. Couldn't get on to Netbank, not the app but through a PC. I have an urgent payment to make, so went to the local branch, where they told me that everything was in chaos and they couldn't access any information to process any payments. ATMs were working off and on, with a $200 limit.  Given the payment I was going to make would save me on interest, and has been delayed, I asked if they could waive the additional interest due to the system outage. Blank looks. Penelope 12:58:38 PM Hi Michael, re the CBA outage confirming at 12:55pm I was able to access my accounts via the app and transfer cash between them. The app can’t display the “simple balance” on the Home Screen but it was fine once I logged in. Commbank Customer 1:01:40 PM my commbank app was showing $0 and no account info all morning but now my balance is back (and my loans unfortunately) Georgia 1:06:19 PM My CommBank app has been intermittently working throughout the day. Currently not working but needed lunch so took a gamble on Maccas to try my card and didn’t seem to have any issues… or I’ve accidentally stolen food. Kate 12:50:36 PM CBA ISSUE I feel the CBA are not being truthful about the issue. I’m not able to process our payroll.. have been able to access payments since 8am today This small sample of feedback seems to corroborate CBA's statement that there are intermittent issues affecting some customers, although it definitely sounds like \"some\" = \"many\", perhaps even \"most\". We wait to hear more from CBA. My colleagues, our national consumer affairs reporter Michael Atkin and Leonie Thorne, are on the case and are updating the story below as they find out more. I'll also keep you up to date in this blog until it closes around 4:30pm AEST.",
