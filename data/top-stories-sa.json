So, how much of our energy needs are being met by renewable sources? Daniel Westerman, who is the boss of the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO), told ABC's AM program it fluctuates. \"In fact in the National Electricity Market, we've experienced times of up to 68% of our power fed by renewable energy. \"On average, though, throughout the year, it's about a third. The remaining two thirds ... is powered by these old coal fired power stations. \"That really does signal the transition that over the next decade, we expect a significant number to retire to be replaced by the cheapest form of new build energy, which is renewable energy backed up by storage and connected with transmission. \"The challenge for us is to make sure that those new projects get and built in a timely fashion.\"",

But NAB this morning has released a note saying although inflation is coming down, price pressures are still likely to remain in the weeks ahead. That's because the monthly reading was goods heavy, while electricity prices rose by 15.7% because of rebates introduced in July, NAB market analyst Rodrigo Catril said. \"Overall, the decline in the headline reading is welcome news for the RBA, but we are mindful tha t bigger price pressures are likely in August and September ,\" he said. \"For one, these readings will be more services heavy and two, the energy/electricity jump is still working its way through. \"Then one further known unknown is the impact from wage increases on services inflation, thus we remain wary of higher inflation prints over coming months .",
