The ASX 200 index lost 1.6 per cent with energy stocks and miners driving the falls. China is Australia's biggest export market and a slowdown in economic activity means lower demand for commodities like coal and iron ore. Weaker iron ore prices weighed on the big miners with market heavyweight BHP losing 3.4 per cent. Coal prices also slumped at the Port of Newcastle which pulled down coal miners. Newcastle coal futures fell to $135.10, the lowest level since June 2021. Stronger than expected inflation in April also weighed on confidence as the chance of a interest rate rise next month by the Reserve Bank increased. Some economists, such as George Tharenou from UBS, think next week's RBA meeting is \"live\". While the market is now betting on a 35 per cent chance of a rate hike next week, rates staying on hold is seen as the most likely outcome. And the Australian dollar fell to a seven month low of 64.85 US cents on the weaker China data.",
