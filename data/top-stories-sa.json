He told RN Breakfast the passengers on board were professionals, and they would be rationing their oxygen. \"They will be utilising their oxygen very sparingly,\" he said. \"They will not be fast breathing, they will not be panicking.\" He said they have chemicals and blankets on board which help keep the carbon dioxide out of the air. \"So I think that window of 20 hours that people keep talking about will not apply to these people. I think they could easily get another 24 hours out of this.\"",

Ford employs around 1,800 people in Australia, and says the changes are about efficiency. \"The changes are part of Ford's global drive to improve efficiency and transform its operations to meet future needs,\" Ford said in a statement. The Australian Manufacturing Workers' Union (AMWU) says most of the job losses won't come into effect until September. Ford's Australian operations are the latest to undergo job cuts, with around 3,800 jobs to go across its Europe sites as it shifts towards electric vehicle manufacturing.
