The former consumer watchdog boss will dig into the thorny issue through a union-backed inquiry set up by the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU). The union says the inquiry will examine: The extent of price gouging facing working people on essential items The disproportionate effect experienced by cohorts of workers and vulnerable groups The effect of price gouging on the safety and mental health of workers providing essential goods and services The ACTU has been concerned excessive corporate profits are doing more to fuel sky-high inflation than rising wages, as AAP reports. Inflation started surging last year and has triggered a series of interest rate rises to bring it under control, with the higher borrowing costs and elevated cost of living putting Australian households under financial pressure. The role of corporate profits in the inflation outbreak has been debated, with Treasury and Reserve Bank analysis suggesting profits were not significantly driving up prices, with the exception of the mining sector.",

It's a program record for the largest television audience for broadcaster Channel Seven and is higher than recent NRL grand finals. Colin Smith, director of global media and sports, which advises sports events on media rights, says it shows how much Australians embrace their local teams. \"Like with Ash Barty winning the Australian Open, that Australians actually embrace the leading competitions and especially when their own team, the Matildas, are playing,\" he told ABC News. \"It's very exciting and it doesn't matter whether it's male or female, everyone is really embracing this and it's a really family environment that are following the Matildas.\" He says the fact the games have been played on home soil is another major factor for ratings success. \"It's a combination of being the home World Cup and Australians' embrace of world competitions, and we saw that with the women's Cricket World Cup where we had 85,000 people at the MCG,\" he says. \"They really embraced that and that's increasingly so. \"These audience numbers are huge and it's a credit to the Matildas and frankly it's a credit to the organisers having this World Cup here in Australia.\"",

The workspace provider also issued a warning that its management needed to raise additional capital to keep the company afloat and maintain liquidity over the next 12 months. The company had previously said its actions to restructure debt and operations had eased worries over its ability to continue as a going concern. WeWork struck deals in March to cut its debt by about $1.5 billion and extend the date of some maturities to preserve cash. The company, which is yet turn a profit since going public, has struggled to cope with the troubles in the tech sector, where mass layoffs have become rampant. It has also seen an exodus of top executives, including the resignation of CEO Sandeep Mathrani and CFO Andre Fernandez this year, compounding its troubles. Mathrani was hired in 2020 and tasked with the company's turnaround amid rising investor concerns over corporate governance standards. WeWork on Tuesday said it was still continuing its search for a permanent CEO and that it had added four board members after three members stepped down. - Reuters",

The fashion firm was founded by sisters Nicky and Simone Zimmerman in 1991 and grew into a globally recognised brand. Reuters reported the deal valued the brand at about $1.8 billion. Zimmermann has revenue of around $US260 million and a more than 30 per cent core profit margin. The sisters will retain a minority stake along with Italian private equity investor Style Capital, and will continue to run the company with the current management. Zimmermann has 58 stores across Australia, the US, UK, Europe and China. Advent International says the deal will allow Zimmermann to expand into new luxury markets, including in Asia and Europe, and ramp up its distribution network including online. Advent has investments in brands including high-end perfume brands Parfums de Marly and INITIO Parfums Prives, cosmetics brand owner Orveon, and Lululemon Athletica, which sells athletic and yoga wear. Here's Advent International managing partner Ranjan Sen: “Zimmermann presents a rare and exciting opportunity to acquire a fast-growing iconic luxury fashion brand with significant potential for further expansion. \" \"The Zimmermann team have successfully created a distinctive and desirable global luxury brand, which has built a loyal customer base around the world.\" Co-founder Nicky Zimmermann says she is excited about further expansion. \"There are so many exciting opportunities for Zimmermann ahead and Simone and I feel extremely fortunate to be going on this journey with our team, one that started nearly 30 years ago at Paddington Markets in Sydney. \" \"We look forward to working collaboratively with our new partners to achieve our shared ambitions for the brand, with our loyal clients at the centre of that vision.”",
