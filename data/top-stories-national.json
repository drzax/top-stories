They have also been identified and arrested. \"The fire has reached a massive area of pine trees near the town of Lac and this is one of the worst wildfires this year,\" Interior Minister Taulant Balla has said on social media. Local media showed video of an army helicopter pouring water in the area as a flames could be seen close to houses. Defence Minister Niko Peleshi says 50 soldiers were deployed but stopping the fire remains a challenge because of the difficult terrain. Just in July, Albania has identified and charged 14 people with starting wildfires which is punishable with up to 15 years jail time. Wildfires are also raging in Greece, Spain, Italy and Portugal, as the region suffers hot, dry and windy conditions that scientists have linked to climate change.",

Trump's former lawyer John Eastman and Republican poll watcher Scott Hall both surrendered to the county sheriff's office, two days before Trump himself is set to turn himself in to face his fourth criminal indictment this year. Eastman is agreeing to a $US100,000 bond agreement. \"My legal team and I will vigorously contest every count of the indictment in which I have been named and also every count in which others are named,\" he says. \"I am confident that when the law is faithfully applied in this proceeding, all of my co-defendents and I will be fully vindicated.\" He says he does not regret attaching himself to the former president. Hall, a Republican poll watcher in Georgia's Fulton County, is in jail after being booked by the county sheriff's office. Hall previously agreed to a $US10,000 bond deal requiring that he report to pre-trial supervision every 30 days.",
