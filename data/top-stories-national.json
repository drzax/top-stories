It's a program record for the largest television audience for broadcaster Channel Seven and is higher than recent NRL grand finals. Colin Smith, director of global media and sports, which advises sports events on media rights, says it shows how much Australians embrace their local teams. \"Like with Ash Barty winning the Australian Open, that Australians actually embrace the leading competitions and especially when their own team, the Matildas, are playing,\" he told ABC News. \"It's very exciting and it doesn't matter whether it's male or female, everyone is really embracing this and it's a really family environment that are following the Matildas.\" He says the fact the games have been played on home soil is another major factor for ratings success. \"It's a combination of being the home World Cup and Australians' embrace of world competitions, and we saw that with the women's Cricket World Cup where we had 85,000 people at the MCG,\" he says. \"They really embraced that and that's increasingly so. \"These audience numbers are huge and it's a credit to the Matildas and frankly it's a credit to the organisers having this World Cup here in Australia.\"",

The lower bid values the funeral service provider at $1.8 billion. TPG tabled an all-cash offer of $12.70 per share, lower than its previous $13 bid for the New South Wales-based company. InvoCare's board unanimously recommended its shareholders to vote in favour of the revised proposal. Shares of Invocare have been on a trading halt since Monday. The deal includes a franked special dividend of up to 60 cents per share that the board said represents total implied value of about $12.96 apiece.

The company expects to report earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) for the first half in the range of $61 million to $63 million (compared with A$68.5 million a year ago). TPG, which holds a 19.2% stake in InvoCare, had initially approached the target in March with a $12.65-per-share offer. InvoCare's share price has risen 5.9% to $12.47.",

Natural graphite active anode material is used in manufacturing lithium-ion batteries for electric vehicles, and can be produced at a lower cost with reduced environmental impact. Under the deal, both companies would look to test and qualify active anode material, to finalise, by no later than July 10, 2024.
