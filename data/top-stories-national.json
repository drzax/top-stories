              "plaintext": "The Australian share market is posting modest early gains, although Australia's two biggest miners have fallen further into the red on fears about Chinese commodity demand as one of the nation's largest developers teeters on the brink of collapse. This is the latest on the Country Garden situation from Reuters : China's largest private real estate developer Country Garden is seeking to delay payment on a private onshore bond for the first time, the latest sign of a stifling cash crunch in the property sector, piling pressure on Beijing to step in. Adding to worries about contagion risk, a major Chinese trust company that traditionally had sizable exposure to real estate, Zhongrong International Trust Co, has missed its repayment obligations on some investment products. Analysts warned that a rise in default by trust companies, also known as shadow banks, which have strong ties to the domestic property sector, will further weigh on the world's second-largest economy. Those fears have seen BHP and Rio Tinto fall around 0.5% in early trade, after steeper drops yesterday. Fortescue Metals is holding up, however, rising 1.1%. Industrials, energy and mining were among the sectors slightly in the red on the ASX 200 today, but big gains in healthcare and solid rises for tech, real estate and financials more than offset those losses. There are 109 companies on the up, compared to only 72 of the top 200 on the slide. The ASX 200 is up 0.3% to 7,300 points in the first 20 minutes of trade. The Aussie dollar has also stabilised, sitting at 64.89 US cents .",

It has reported a 3.3% decline in net profit after tax to $254.5 million on a 2.2% fall in sales revenue. However, its earnings before tax, interest and material one-offs climbed 11.4% to $583.5 million, with underlying net profit (excluding those one-offs) rising 16.6% to $376.1 million. The company says its strategy of \"premiumisation\" is working to improve profit margins on the wine it is selling, with its margin jumping 2.9 percentage points to 24.1%. It is targeting a margin of around 25%. TWE said demand for its luxury and premium wines remains solid, especially its flagship Penfolds brand, which saw both sales and profits rise more than 14%. The company says it expects demand for its luxury wines to continue being strong, while premium wine demand is expected to remain \"consistent\". However, \"commercial\" wine demand is expected to \"remain challenged\" with TWE predicting further volume decreases for the mass market segment. The company has declared a final dividend of 17 cents per share, which leaves the full-year payout for shareholders at 35 cents per share.",

In his petition, Oher asks for the conservatorship to be terminated along with asking for a full accounting of the money earned off the use of his name and story. He also asks to be paid what he is due, along with interest. He accuses the Tuohys of enriching themselves at his expense by continuing to \"falsely and publicly\" represent themselves as his adoptive parents \"to the date of the filing of this petition\". \"Oher discovered this lie to his chagrin and embarrassment in February of 2023, when he learned that the Conservatorship, to which he consented on the basis that doing so would make him a member of the Tuohy family, in fact provided him no familial relationship with the Tuohys,\" according to the petition. Oher, who has never been a fan of the movie about his life, also asks in the petition that the Tuohys be sanctioned and required to pay both compensatory and punitive damages determined by the court.
