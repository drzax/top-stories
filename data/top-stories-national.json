                  "articleBody": "By Tim Callanan Victorian social services groups have cautiously welcomed “modest” increases in support in the federal budget for people struggling with the cost of living crisis. That includes an increase to the JobSeeker rate by $40 a fortnight and the government’s energy bill relief plan. Victorian Council of Social Service CEO Emma King said there were positive moves in the budget to help vulnerable people. “There's critical support in there for single parents, people on low incomes who need health care, and it kicked off really important investment to retrofit low-income homes to improve energy efficiency,” she said. However, Ms King had one eye on the upcoming state budget, which Premier Daniel Andrews has repeatedly warned will be “tough”. “We've got a real challenge on our hands in terms of what we've got to look forward to in looking at the Victorian budget and where those cuts might be,” she said."

McKenzie: This is a missed opportunity to permanently lower people’s power bills. To meet the climate challenge head on, Australia needs to urgently unlock the most affordable energy source available, renewables. Sure, this Budget provides renewables assistance to 170,000 households. But when you consider the critical challenge of electrifying everything with renewable power, backed with storage, for 10.8 million households, that barely gets us off the starting blocks. The Labor Government has demonstrated in this Budget that they want to support Australians who are struggling. Climate change makes every Australian vulnerable, so the scale of investment on climate action needs to match the task ahead of us."

Extra money has also been promised for roads in Northern WA, and $16.3 million dollars for Perth to host the World Masters Games, if Australia's bid is successful. Eligible Western Australians will only receive a $350 electricity credit … below the $500 going to those along the east coast. From next year the state's GST payments will be slightly higher than forecast last year, growing to more than $9 billion in the 2025-26 financial year."

This time around, NSW will get $362 million over eight years, including for safety upgrades on the Bells Line of Road and Nowra Bypass planning. There's also $3 million to look at the feasibility of an intermodal terminal in Forbes, as part of the Inland Rail program. The government has said the $120 billion in the pipeline of the Infrastructure Investment Program will be reviewed, working with the states and territories to determine priorities."

Have heard nothing on this since 21 May. Presumably it's an inflationary measure, but still a game changer for those lagging behind the housing market  - Josh. Hi Josh! Thanks for writing in. I've passed on your question to political reporter Jake Evans who says: The Help to Buy scheme was funded in the treasurer's first budget in October last year. The federal government committed in that budget to $324.6 million over four years to establish the scheme to help people on low to moderate incomes to purchase a new or existing home with an equity contribution from the government. The treasurer said in his budget speech last year that the scheme would assist up to 40,000 people."

They don't come in for more than a year now. They haven't actually been a focus of the deliberations for this budget at all.\""

That includes an increase to the JobSeeker rate by $40 a fortnight and the government’s energy bill relief plan. Victorian Council of Social Service CEO Emma King said there were positive moves in the budget to help vulnerable people. “There's critical support in there for single parents, people on low incomes who need health care, and it kicked off really important investment to retrofit low-income homes to improve energy efficiency,” she said. However, Ms King had one eye on the upcoming state budget, which Premier Daniel Andrews has repeatedly warned will be “tough”. “We've got a real challenge on our hands in terms of what we've got to look forward to in looking at the Victorian budget and where those cuts might be,” she said.",

Well, it's not on a par with the $1.4 billion allocated to NSW infrastructure projects in the Labor government's first budget last October or the $3.3 billion in the Coalition's pre-election budget in March last year. This time around, NSW will get $362 million over eight years, including for safety upgrades on the Bells Line of Road and Nowra Bypass planning. There's also $3 million to look at the feasibility of an intermodal terminal in Forbes, as part of the Inland Rail program. The government has said the $120 billion in the pipeline of the Infrastructure Investment Program will be reviewed, working with the states and territories to determine priorities.",

I've passed on your question to political reporter Jake Evans who says: The Help to Buy scheme was funded in the treasurer's first budget in October last year. The federal government committed in that budget to $324.6 million over four years to establish the scheme to help people on low to moderate incomes to purchase a new or existing home with an equity contribution from the government. The treasurer said in his budget speech last year that the scheme would assist up to 40,000 people.",

There's also $3 million to look at the feasibility of an intermodal terminal in Forbes, as part of the Inland Rail program.
