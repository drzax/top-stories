The big takeaway is that the RBA is now seeing evidence that there is a greater risk of inflation staying higher for longer. Here's more of her statement: \"Since its August meeting, the Board has received updated information on inflation, the labour market, economic activity and the revised set of forecasts. \"The weight of this information suggests that the risk of inflation remaining higher for longer has increased. \"While the economy is experiencing a period of below-trend growth, it has been stronger than expected over the first half of the year. \" Underlying inflation was higher than expected at the time of the August forecasts, including across a broad range of services.\"",

But the Israeli leader reiterated his country's rejection of a ceasefire without the release of all people being held captive in the Hamas-ruled Palestinian enclave. Mr Netanyahu made the comments in an interview with the US ABC News. \"Well, there'll be no ceasefire, no general ceasefire in Gaza without the release of our hostages,\" he said. \"As far as tactical little pauses — an hour here, an hour there — we've had them before. \"I suppose we'll check the circumstances, in order to enable goods, humanitarian goods, to come in, or our hostages, individual hostages, to leave.\" He was also asked who should govern Gaza after fighting is over. \"I think Israel will for an indefinite period ... have the overall security responsibility because we've seen what happens when we don't have that security responsibility,\" he said. Both Israel and Hamas have rebuffed mounting international pressure for a ceasefire. Israel says Hamas should release the hostages first; Hamas says it will not free them or stop fighting while Gaza is under assault. Reuters",
