Ms O'Neil has urged Australians in Israel to leave on this last planned flight. \"Don't assume that there will be continuous options to leave. If you want to leave, there is a flight leaving today, please get on it,\" she said. Forty-six Australians in Gaza have registered with the government to leave the war-torn area. \"What we need to understand here is that Gaza is effectively locked off, \"There are 2 million people living in a tiny plot of land with only one entry and exit point that is currently not open,\" she says. Ms O'Neil says the government is trying \"incredibly hard\" to get more information about the Australians in Gaza and is working on a plan to get them out.",
