Hodder Watt says a lack of signage, translators and low foot traffic at some of the booths meant many community members weren't aware that voting was underway. \"It really was left up to community members and organisations on the day to make people aware,\" he said. \"There is a risk there that some people would have missed out.\"",

She joined federal Liberal colleagues at the Marden polling booth and held an impromptu press conference, saying she believes exit polls are under-representing No votes. \"There are those that are reluctant to express a public vote for No. \"Really, if we were to take people's true measure of how they actually voted, we would probably find that there were more people voting No than actually those who have come out to say publicly.\" Senator Jacinta Nampijinpa Price plans to cast her ballot in her home town next week. The Marden polling booth is in the federal electorate of Sturt and the local Liberal MP James Stevens says how people vote there will be crucial. \"If Sturt votes No, South Australia will vote No and if South Australia votes No the referendum will be defeated, so we take our responsibility here on the ground very seriously.\"",

You can find an early polling location near you using the AEC's 'Where Can I Vote?' tool. Below are the reasons why you can vote early in the Voice referendum: You are outside the electorate where you are enrolled to vote You are more than 8km from a polling place You are travelling You can't leave your workplace to vote You are seriously ill, infirm or due to give birth shortly (or are caring for someone who is) You are a patient in hospital and can't vote at the hospital You have religious beliefs that prevent you from attending a polling place You are in prison serving a sentence of less than three years or otherwise detained You are a silent elector You have a reasonable fear for your safety You can read more about whether you are eligible to vote early here.",

The RBNZ decision leaves the cash rate at its 15-year high for a third straight meeting. \"Interest rates are constraining economic activity and reducing inflationary pressure as required,\" the central bank said in a statement. The RBNZ said the monetary committee agreed that interest rates will need to remain at a restrictive level for the foreseeable future to ensure consumer price inflation returns to its 1% to 3% target range. \"With monetary conditions remaining restrictive, spending growth is expected to decline further,\" the bank said. However, like the RBA, it cautioned of potential future increases to rates should inflation not slow as much as required.",

They say residential mortgage delinquency rates, or the rate at which borrowers have failed to meet their repayments, will continue to rise for the rest of the year as high interest rates and inflation wear down household savings. Data for the latest for residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) from Moody's shows that that the share of prime quality home loans that were at least 30 days in arrears (30+ days delinquency rate) was 1.38% in June 2023, up from 1.25% in March — but are lower than the peak of 1.76% seen during COVID. \"While the Reserve Bank of Australia has paused its cycle of interest rates rises, the central bank's steep rate hikes ... have considerably raised mortgage repayment costs ,\" said Moody's Investors Service vice president, Alena Chen. \"Additionally, inflation, while easing from recent peaks, remains well above the RBA's target range at 5.2%, which means borrowers have to contend with elevated consumer prices and that high interest rates will likely persist for some time. \"The combination of high interest rates and inflation has materially reduced Australia's household savings ratio to 3.2% (the lowest level since 2008), which is weakening the capacity of financially vulnerable borrowers to meet mortgage repayments.\" The report also notes that a number of mortgages are set to come off their lower fixed-rate periods by the end of the year onto higher, variable loans, which will increase the risk of mortgage stress. \"We expect mortgage delinquencies will only rise moderately, because Australia's low unemployment rate (3.7% in August) and recovering housing prices will mitigate risks for borrowers,\" Ms Chen said. \"Additionally, lenders have substantially cut back on risky mortgage lending over recent years, which will further mitigate risks.\"",
