Captain Danniel Lyon, Lieutenant Maxwell Nugent, Warrant Officer Class Two Joseph Laycock and Corporal Alexander Naggs were on board the MRH90 helicopter that ditched into the ocean during a training exercise as part of Exercise Talisman Sabre on Friday night. Mr Keogh said the search has involved Australian Defence Force personnel, United States Defence Force, as well as Queensland emergency services. \"This is our first priority,\" he said. \"It is finding our four missing Defence Force members. As well as providing support to their families at this difficult time when their family members are missing. And that remains our key priority. \"As you'll appreciate, there are people involved in this search that are part of the defence family for the four that are missing as well and they're throwing everything at finding them as soon as we can.\"",

The local share market is likely to open higher, with ASX futures suggesting a 0.3% rise in morning trade. It comes after a strong finish on Wall Street last Friday (US time), which saw the Dow Jones, S & P 500 and Nasdaq Composite rise 0.5%, 1% and 1.9% respectively. In economic news, the key event is tomorrow's Reserve Bank board meeting. Markets are betting the likelihood of of an interest rate hike is around 20%, according to Refinitiv data. However, economists from Westpac, Commonwealth Bank and other places are predicting the RBA will (more likely than not) lift its cash rate target. If the RBA keeps rates on hold, it would mean the cash rate remains at a decade high of 4.1% .",
