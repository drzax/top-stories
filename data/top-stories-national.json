The conditions seem pretty good for bowling out there - although it's hard to tell before both teams have a go. The lights are on, the clouds are rolling around above The Oval in South London and the ball is doing just a little bit through the air. The over rate is as bad as we've come to expect in the series - not helped by Todd Murphy being given just an odd over here and there. Will he be given more in the final session of the day? Jon Healy will be here to tell you all about it.",
