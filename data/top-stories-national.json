Here's what she said: \"Obviously we see in BHP, nickel as a future facing commodity, we certainly see it as a mineral that is absolutely required in the future. We've been active in the discussions on the roundtables and the discussion on critical minerals and metals in Australia and see that it absolutely makes sense to continue on that trajectory. It [being on the list or not] doesn't change what we will do with the asset and our views going forward.\" Now I'm back at my desk, I see the government will update its critical minerals list by the end of the year. BHP's Australia boss, Geraldine Slattery wants uranium on the list too. Here's what Ms Farrell said about uranium at the WA mining event. \"We see that uranium is part of the energy portfolio. Yes we do produce uranium, as one of our South Australian assets, and we do see it as part of an energy future.\" The current critical minerals list includes 26 minerals with supply chains that are considered vulnerable to disruption, such as lithium, cobalt and rare earths. According to the government's website: \"The list is based on global technology needs, particularly for emissions reduction, advanced manufacturing and defence.\" Those on the list could be available for government incentives to speed up new project development. The government is calling for submissions to update the list.",

Rio Tinto (-2.5 per cent) fell after posting a fall in first half profit because of lower commodity prices. Fortescue Metals (-3.4 per cent) lost ground despite shipping record amounts of iron ore. Macquarie Group (-4.4 per cent) fell after flagging a lower than expected first quarter profit. Megaport (+14.4 per cent) surged after a strong trading update. US stocks closed little changed after the Federal Reserve raised interest rates by 0.25 per cent to 5.25 per cent to 5.5 per cent. Fed chair Jerome Powell left the way open for another rate rise as the US central bank seeks to get inflation down to 2 per cent over time.",
