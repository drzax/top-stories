All the talk before the game was about how the Football Ferns could just about lock up a knockout spot with a win this afternoon, but suddenly the Philippines have thrown that into disarray. Sarina Bolden's goal was the result of near-perfect attacking play from Philippines, with Sara Eggesvik's cross put perfectly in her path and the leap and header was clean. New Zealand will be disappointed by the efforts of defenders CJ Bott and Rebekah Stott, while goalie Victoria Esson got both hands to it right in front of her face but couldn't handle. New Zealand beat Norway in their opener, and now if this game stays like this, the group is completely wide open. Especially if Norway beat Switzerland tonight, then every team in the group will be on one win each!",

With local earnings season looming, though, the iron ore miners could soon come under pressure again — Rio Tinto will release its results after the close tomorrow and half-year earnings are expected to have fallen. Consumer stocks were not so buoyant — the big supermarkets Woolworths (-0.5%) and Coles (-0.3%) made modest losses while Wesfarmers dropped 0.9 per cent — the retailer said it will be merging the back-end operations of Target and Kmart. The major banks also ended in the red.",

Now, the RBA has released the schedule for its extended two-day meetings, which will see the new governor Michele Bullock hold a press conference after each decision is announced. While it will mean interest rate changes less often, it could also see the RBA board make bigger moves on occasion, according to some analysts. The 2024 meetings will be held on: 5–6 February 18–19 March 6–7 May 17–18 June 5–6 August 23–24 September 4–5 November 9–10 December",

The restructure means that Kmart and Target will be run as the one business with a value of $10 billion. Here's Kmart Group managing director Ian Bailey: \"The announcements today are an internal reorganisation of our support offices and there are no impacts to the Kmart or Target stores. \"With customers now demanding value more than ever, this new operating model will unlock a new level of scale and productivity across both brands, so we can deliver even greater value to our customers in the future. \"For store networks and 50,000 store team members it's business as usual as we continue to focus on providing the best value products to the thousands of customers in Australia and New Zealand who choose to shop at Kmart or Target every day.\" Bailey says there will be a \"handful\" of redundancies mostly in technology and merchandising. Kmart chief executive John Gualtieri will run the combined business. Griffith University Business Lab director Graeme Hughes says the move comes after Kmart's success overshadowed Target's performance. \"This differentiation      seeks to appeal to a wider range of shoppers and strengthen the      competitiveness of both brands.\"",
