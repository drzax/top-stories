Let me explain. The FWC spent a good chunk of its decision talking about the C14 classification. For the last 25 years, that classification has been aligned with the national minimum wage. In today's decision, the FWC is ending that alignment between C14 classification and the national minimum wage. Instead, the national minimum wage will be aligned with a slightly higher classification of C13 — and that classification's wage rate will jump by 5.75%. For those workers who were once on the C14 rate, it means they will be getting a total pay increase of 8.6%. That's why the minimum wage in dollar values is now $23.23 an hour, or $882.80 a week. If it were only a 5.75% increase, the hourly rate for those minimum wage workers would have been $22.60. But the FWC has framed the increase in the minimum wage as only being a 5.75% increase, because that's the size of the increase in the C13 classification rate that the minimum wage will now be aligned with.",
