The ACCC launched the case at the end of August alleging the airline engaged in false, misleading or deceptive conduct by advertising tickets for more than 8,000 flights that it had already cancelled but not removed from sale. The ACCC alleges that for more than 8,000 flights scheduled to depart between May and July 2022, Qantas kept selling tickets on its website for an average of more than two weeks, and in some cases for up to 47 days, after the cancellation of the flights. While apologising again to affected customers, Qantas said it will defend itself against claims it broke consumer laws. \"Qantas fully accepts it let customers down during the post-COVID restart, including with high cancellation rates,\" the company said in a statement. \"In purely legal terms, the ACCC's case ignores a fundamental reality and a key condition that applies when airlines sell a ticket. \"While all airlines work hard to operate flights at their scheduled times, no airline can guarantee that. That's because the nature of travel — when weather and operational issues mean delays and cancellations are inevitable and unavoidable — makes such a guarantee impossible. (This is acknowledged on the ACCC's own website). \"For this reason, our promise is to get customers on their way to their destination as close as possible to the flight time they book, either on their original or an alternative service at no additional cost. If not, we offer a full refund. This is consistent with our obligations under consumer law and is what we did during the period the ACCC examined.\" Whether the court accepts this as a defence for still selling tickets on flights that the airline had already cancelled will be interesting to see.",

Wall Street's action on Friday highlights this, with the S & P 500 index falling around 0.5% pushing it down into correction territory, which is when prices are off at least 10% from their most recent peak. The benchmark Wall Street index has dropped for eight sessions out of the past nine. \"The rise in global yields led by US Treasuries has triggered a reassessment on the equity outlook and more recently heightening geopolitical tensions have become an additional headwind with mixed corporate earnings reports not helping sentiment either,\" explained NAB's senior FX strategist Rodrigo Catril. In contrast, the Nasdaq edged higher after some positive profit news. \" Amazon, META and Intel Corp gained on Friday following better than expected earnings, helping the NASDAQ close 0.38% higher on the day, still the index was 2.62% lower on the week and down 4.36% month to date,\" Mr Catril added. But there isn't a big tech sector in Australia, so our market is poised for a fairly large drop. The ASX SPI 200 futures were down 1% ahead of the trading week. Grab a coffee, tea or your other preference of caffeinated (or non-caffeinated) beverage and stay tuned for our market open at 10am AEDT and the rest of the day.",
