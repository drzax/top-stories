The ASX 200 fell 0.1 per cent to 7,030. The annual rate of inflation picked up in August, to 5.2 per cent from 4.9 per cent, according to the latest monthly measure of inflation, with this pushed up by more expensive housing, transport, food and insurance. Markets globally continued to digest last week's indication from the US Federal Reserve that it would keep rates higher for longer than investors had previously expected. Back home, gold stocks fell 2 per cent to a more than one-month low as bullion retreated overnight. On the benchmark index, sector majors Newcrest Mining and Northern Star Resources fell 2 per cent and 2.4 per cent, respectively. Healthcare stocks also retreated 0.7 per cent with biotech major CSL falling 1.4 per cent. Rate-sensitive financial stocks held up well, gaining 0.1 per cent. Technology stocks tracked Wall Street losses to slide nearly 1 per cent, and energy stocks also fell 0.4 per cent. Star Entertainment topped losses on the benchmark index, falling almost 10 per cent to hit its all-time low. The stock resumed trading after completing a discounted $750 million equity raising. The mining sector (-0.1pc) also finished the day in the red. Here are the top and bottom movers of the day.",
