It now thinks the Reserve Bank will lift the official cash rate to 4.6 per cent, seeing possible rate increases of 0.25 per cent in both July and August. That's to curb high inflation and the risk of rising prices leading to more calls for higher wages. The NAB's economics team, led by chief economist, Alan Oster, expects the economy to pull back to its slowest pace since the 1990s recession. \"Taking rates to 4.6 per cent will weigh more heavily on growth and we have revised down our expectations for  growth over 2023 to just 0.5 per cent and pulled back expectations for 2024 to around 0.9 per cent.\" \"That sees  unemployment rise more quickly and reach 5 per cent by end 2024.\" \"We still see the RBA cutting interest rates back towards neutral in 2024 as a “forward-looking” central bank  sees the slowing in growth and unemployment rising.... and it becomes clearer inflation is returning to target.\"",

That's a lot of money, although the value of residential dwellings did reach $10.2 trillion for the first time in March last year. The mean price of Australian homes lifted by $8,500 to $896,000 with the total number of dwellings up 52,000 to just over 11 million over the first three months of 2023. New South Wales has the highest home prices in the country with a mean price of $1.15 million. The value of Australian homes rose in all states except Tasmania, the Northern Territory, and the ACT.
