The leader on the ASX today is medical imaging company Pro Medicus after securing a $140 million, 10-year contract with the largest not-for-profit healthcare system in Texas, Baylor Scott & White Health. Its shares jumped 9.3 per cent at the open, but have pared back a little to 9 per cent — to be valued at $77.62 a share, shortly after 11am AEST. Pro Medicus will supply cloud-engineered imaging services, starting in the first quarter of 2024. \"Baylor Scott & White Health joins our impressive list of IDN and Tier 1 academic clients and represents our first major client in Texas.\" Dr Sam Hupert, the chief executive of Pro Medicus, told the market: \"The scale and scope of our initiative with Baylor Scott & White Health is noteworthy and will include nearly 500 radiologists who will be exposed to the benefits of Visage 7.\"",

In a video aired on the ABC's Four Corners program, a teenager is shown being pinned face-down by six workers in protective headgear at Irabina Autism Services in Melbourne as part of its 'Severe Behaviour Program'. The program ceased in 2021, and Irabina has since been acquired by new owners. Anthony Albanese says he has not seen the footage, but the audio he heard was \"very confronting\". \"Some of the - what I take was - audio from the footage... I found it very disturbing. And I know that the NDIS Minister, Bill Shorten, will be responding appropriately to that,\" he said.

As we've reported on throughout the morning, the Australian and International Pilot's Association is calling for Qantas chairman Richard Goyder to resign, saying the association has \"totally lost confidence\" in him, and questions if the company can move forward under his leadership. Two weeks ago, the company was found by the High Court to have illegally sacked 1,700 ground crew staff during the pandemic. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese says the airline is an important Australian brand. \"What we know is Qantas has a lot of work to do to repair the damage that has been done to its reputation both in terms of workers and in terms of customers,\" he said.",
