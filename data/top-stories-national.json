              "plaintext": "Hot on the heels of Wednesday's stronger-than-expected inflation reading for the September quarter comes a rebound in the producer price index for the same period. This ABS measure was up 1.8% for the quarter and 3.8% over the past year. While the annual figure isn't too far above the top of the RBA's 2-3% target for inflation, the reacceleration of the quarterly number would be a concern. As you can see, it's the second-highest in recent years. Basically, this measures the input costs for businesses across the economy, and as those costs go up, businesses can either pass them on to customers or absorb them via lower profits. You don't have to be a genius to guess which option businesses prefer. Rabobank's global strategists see it as yet another reason for the Reserve Bank board to hike interest rates (at least) once more. \"This adds to the case for the RBA to resume its hiking cycle at the November meeting, where we expect a 25bps lift in the cash rate to 4.35%.\" Of course, if the increases in interest rates are already working to reduce consumer demand, then many companies may struggle to pass their costs on without losing a lot of sales. So a higher PPI may mean lower profits as much as it signals higher consumer prices. This is what drove the big jump in business costs. \"Higher prices for construction outputs, petroleum and energy were compounded by broad-based price increases in services, particularly health and childcare services,\" the ABS noted. \"New financial year contract negotiations, indexation clauses, annual wage cost reviews and increasing operating costs contributed to price rises across services industries.\" So, therein lies the good news. The producer price index is not seasonally adjusted, and an awful lot of price adjustments take effect on July 1 each year (the start of the September quarter). Another interesting thing to note is that while construction output costs rose, for the first time in a long time the cost of building materials didn't. \" The cost of house building materials was unchanged in the September Quarter 2023, for the first time since before the pandemic,\" stated HIA Senior Economist Tom Devitt. \"This sees the cost of house building materials just 4.4 per cent higher over the year, compared to a 17.3 per cent annual increase in 2021/22. \"The slowing in cost of house building inputs reflects a significant easing in the materials constraints that plagued the industry during the pandemic. \"Some of the worst-affected products during the pandemic are now seeing outright declines in price. \"Last year, structural timber and reinforcing steel prices were both up by more than 60 per cent on pre-pandemic levels. In the last year, they have declined by 8.8 per cent and 5.3 per cent respectively. Steel beams and sections, which were up by more than 50 per cent a year ago, subsequently declined by 17.2 per cent.\" But it's clearly going to take a while for that to feed through into cheaper new home builds and renovations, if it ever does.",

The first is the bank's \"Wellbeing Index\", which rose very slightly in the September quarter, albeit from a two-year low. It is still below average levels, with anxiety on the rise but measures of financial stress falling for the first time in six quarters. \"Though Australians are clearly being stretched financially, many appear to be growing more accustomed to these pressures, having made deliberate spending trade-offs to manage household balance sheets and support their lifestyle in the face of inflation and higher rates,\" the report noted. For the month of September, these trade-offs don't appear to have included a massive reduction in retail spending. NAB's monthly online retail sales index rebounded with a 2.9% jump in September after a 1.1% fall in August, with online retail spending now up 11% over the year to September. Of course, inflation has accounted for about half of that growth, with average consumer prices up 5.4% over that same period. Nonetheless, NAB's chief economist Alan Oster says it's another indication of Australians' overall financial resilience in the face of big interest rate hikes. \"The growth for the largest sales category, homewares and appliances, was enough to lift year-on-year growth back to positive territory, which had been negative for over a year,\" he said. \"For the broader online series, and other categories, the improvement in year-on-year growth has been underway since May.\" But NAB's wellbeing survey again highlights that some groups are feeling the financial strain a lot more than others. \"Around 6 in 10 (57%) Australians identified living costs as the biggest cause of their stress (down slightly from 61% in Q2), still well ahead of personal financial issues, health (both physical and mental), housing costs and the economy. \"Concerns around living and housing costs are most pronounced for Australians aged 30-49 and those on lower incomes.\"",

Even before this data, he said the RBA meeting next Tuesday was \"live\". \"We now put the probability of a 25bp rate increase on Melbourne Cup Day at 70%,\" he says. His bet is the cash rate going up to 4.35 per cent, then staying at that level. Now he has given more detail on when he thinks the easing off by the RBA will begin. Aird reckons the cash rate will stay at 4.35 per cent until at least mid-2024 or Q3. \"There are many components of the CPI basket that are running hot, but are largely beyond the control of the RBA,\" he says. \"In particular, strong price rises for petrol, rent and utilities cannot be muted by a higher cash rate.\" Meanwhile, NAB has just upped its variable loan interest rate, indicating it thinks higher rates will be around for longer. Aaaaand ANZ has also just put out a note where it backs the CBA bet for a 0.25 hike on Melbourne Cup. \"We think the RBA will only tighten once in response to the Q3 CPI, although it will retain a tightening bias and the risk of additional hikes is real,\" they noted. Of course, it'll all come down to the RBA. Its governor Michele Bullock noted this week that the inflation data didn't come as much of a surprise to the RBA. \"We viewed the governor's testimony to the Senate on Thursday as an exercise in not being drawn on the implications of the CPI ahead of the November board meeting,\" ANZ says. \"While markets might have pared back expectations of a rate hike in November on that testimony, we think the full context of the Governor's responses … left a rate hike more likely than not.\" We'll see on Cup Day …",
