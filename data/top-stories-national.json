Engineered stone contains high levels of silica which can cause incurable lung disease if workers inhale dust while cutting the material. The ACTU says as many as 1 in 4 stonemasons that work with engineered stone have been diagnosed with silicosis. Federal, State and Territory Work Health and Safety Ministers will meet on Friday to discuss a report by Safe Work Australia which has investigated banning the product.

              "plaintext": "Zip Co has jumped nearly 11 per cent after the buy-now-pay-later (BNPL) company returned to profitability earlier than projected in the first quarter of fiscal 2024 as domestic operations improved. Shares in the company rose to $0.33, the highest price since mid-September. Zip, Australia's biggest standalone BNPL service provider, said it returned to cash earnings before taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBTDA) profitability in the first quarter of fiscal 2024, ahead of its prior guidance for the first half. Owing to the strong performance of its domestic and New Zealand businesses and continued strength in the US total transaction volumes, Zip upgraded its forecast with an aim to touch cash EBTDA profitability for FY24 from a prior projection for the second half of fiscal 2024. \"Zip continues to expect to achieve a positive Group cash EBTDA result for 2H24 and following a particularly strong start to the year, Zip now expects to achieve a positive Group cash EBTDA result for FY24,\" CEO and Managing Director Cynthia Scott said. The company logged a total transaction volume (TTV) of $2.3 billion for the first quarter, an increase of 11 per cent over last year. Group revenue came in at $204.4 million, up 31.9 per cent from a year earlier. US bad debts continued to perform well with monthly cohort loss rates of about 1.3 per cent of TTV, below the target range of 1.5-2.0 per cent, Zip added.",
