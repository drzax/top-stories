So far, 260 bodies have been recovered. Mr Moritz said he and some friends were enjoying the festival when they were caught off guard. \"Around 6am, we noticed bombings above our head — no sirens, nothing went off,\" he told ABC Radio Melbourne. \"Totally surprised, totally unaware and unprotected.\" He and his five friends decided to flee in their car straight away. \"We just came to the decision, our friends, to get out of there, leave our stuff, leave our tents — everything,\" he said. \"Luckily, we parked really close to the entrance. We found a hole in the fence so we managed to get out faster. \"We started to head north, we thought we were protected, and suddenly a machine gun started going off, just shooting at us full force. \"We hear the whistles of the bullets flying over our heads, we're ducking down in the car.\" He said he and his friends managed to escape uninjured, and he's now back home in northern Israel. \"What's going on right now in the country is chaos,\" he said.",

But both Brodie Grundy and Taylor Adams are keen to head to the harbour city too, and those deals will need to be done via trades. The Swans currently have picks 11, 23, 31, 44 and 52. They will not want to use pick 11 in either of these deals, but both Melbourne and Collingwood will be eyeing off that pick 23. So is it 23 for Adams and 31 for Grundy? Vice versa?
