Westpac has told brokers that it's going to let some borrowers refinance over to the big four bank, even if they fail standard stress tests on their new loans. Typically, banks will assess a borrower's finances to make sure they could still afford to pay it if interest rates rose, typically by 3 per cent in line with APRA guidelines. Westpac has told its brokers that now: If a customer is unable to meet serviceability under the standard assessment criteria, a modified Serviceability Assessment Rate (SAR) may be applied as a credit exception to new and existing consumer mortgage commitments. Streamline Refinance is only available to customers who meet eligibility criteria and have a proven track record of servicing their existing loan commitments. The standard floor rate will continue to apply. There is a lot of provisos, however. People can't refinance to Westpac, and its subsidaries St George, Bank of Melbourne and BankSA, under this dropped serviceability if their repayments will be higher than their old loan. They also need a credit score over 650, and no arrears or hardship in the last 12 months. This get out of jail free card also can't be given to people on a guarantor loan or those with lenders mortgage insurance, which would be cutting out a whole lot of first home buyers. Homeloan comparison website RateCity is supporting the deal. \"The current buffer of 3 percentage points helps ensure new borrowers don’t take out excessive debts compared to their incomes,\" it says in a statement. \"However, the test is locking some existing borrowers into mortgage prison.\" RateCity cited data that showed just 3.1 per cent of new loans taken out in December quarter didn't meet serviceability guidelines set by APRA. APRA boosted the serviceability guideline buffer in 2021. \"RateCity.com.au believes Australia’s banking regulator, APRA, should consider officially lowering the serviceability buffer for refinancers,\" the website added. It is an interesting tactic from a bank, in a time when we know that the number of new home loans being taken out is lower than it was during the pandemic boom. The deal also only applies if you're an external customer, but not if you're a current Westpac customer looking to internally refinance within the bank's subsidiaries. What do you think? Is this good policy from the bank, the regulators and the market? Send us a comment here.",

The contract includes options for the detail design and construction of up to seven of the ships which, if the US Navy exercises them, would bring the total value of the contract to $US3.195 billion ($4.8 billion). The ships are primarily used for anti-submarine warfare, using towed array sonar. The ASX-listed company originally specialised in aluminium hulled vessels, such as littoral combat and fast transport ships for the US Navy, but has since expanded into more conventional steel hulls. \"The T-AGOS contract is a clear acknowledgment of Austal's capabilities in steel naval shipbuilding, that includes the Navy's Towing, Salvage and Rescue (T-ATS) ships, an Auxiliary Floating Drydock Medium (AFDM), and the US Coast Guards' Offshore Patrol Cutters,\" said the company's CEO Paddy Gregg. \"These four steel naval shipbuilding projects, and our continuing successful delivery of the Independence-variant Littoral Combat Ship and Spearhead-class Expeditionary Fast Transport programs, are positioning Austal USA exceptionally well to meet the growing demands of the US Navy and Coast Guard.\" If successful, the company will build the ships at its facility in Mobile, Alabama. The company's shares were up 25.4% to $2.00 near the end of trade today.",

It says the network changes will see its international capacity grow to around 100% of pre-COVID levels by March 2024 (up from 44% a year ago, and 84% today). Here are some of the changes coming: More flights to key destinations including Tokyo, Los Angeles and New York Frequency between Australia and Japan to double with four daily flights to Tokyo Two new international routes to launch from Brisbane Two Airbus A330s to be leased from Finnair to meet demand It says an extra 300 workers (pilots and cabin crew) will be needed by the end of the year to support the extra flying. However, some of the extra flying will be achieved by an arrangement with Finnair (Finland's flag carrier and largest airline) to operate two Airbus A330 aircraft on two Qantas routes. Outgoing Qantas CEO Alan Joyce says the rebound in demand for international travel since borders reopened has been \"incredibly strong.\" “While airlines globally are working to restore capacity to meet demand, there is still a mismatch between supply and demand for international flying,\" he said. \"But with more of our aircraft back in the air, new 787s joining our fleet and our contract with Finnair, we’ve got more seats for our customers and more opportunity for Qantas crew as we increase our own flying. “We know our customers are looking for great value and this additional capacity will also put downward pressure on fares.\"",
