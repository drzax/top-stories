The ASX 200 has lost 1% in the first 20 minutes of trading, sitting at 6,757 points. The All Ords is off about the same percentage. This follows a half a per cent fall for Wall Street's benchmark S & P 500 index on Friday. All sectors and about 90% of companies are down on the ASX, but industrials (-2.2%) are leading the losses. The only firms bucking the trend are gold miners, after the precious metal cracked $US2,000 an ounce. Top gainers: Gold Road Resources +2.9% to $1.945 West African Resources +2.7% to $0.76 Bellevue Gold +2.1% to $1.49 Silver Lake Resources +2.1% to $1.0725 Evolution Mining +1.4% to $3.64 Biggest losses: IGO -6.9% to $9.915 Block -6.1% to $62.97 Star Entertainment -3.4% to $0.575 Cromwell Property Group -3% to $0.325 Pilbara Minerals -2.9% to $3.815",
