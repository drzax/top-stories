Reports from Bloomberg suggest that a private equity firm backed by the parent company that owns the German sandal maker is considering strategic options — and that includes an initial public offering (or IPO, if you're up with the lingo). L Catterton, which is a private equity firm backed by LVMH (a mammoth corporation behind major luxury brands), is working with advisers on potentially listing Birkenstock in the US. Discussions are ongoing, and the deal may not proceed, but Bloomberg's reporting suggests Birkenstock could be valued at more than $US6 billion ($9 billion). Birkenstock sold a majority stake to L Catterton in 2021, with the deal at the time valuing the sandal maker at $US4.35 billion ($6.5 billion). L Catterton has declined to comment on the reports, and at the time of writing this, LVMH and Birkenstock haven't responded to requests for comment from Reuters.",
