The odds of a rate hike by the Reserve Bank next week have dropped, with the market betting on a 29 per cent chance of a 0.25 per cent rise, and a 71 per cent chance that rates will stay on hold. The Australian dollar slumped and the Australian market increased to a five-month high. The dollar fell nearly 1 per cent to 67.29 US cents because investors think the pull back in inflation buys the RBA more time to consider how the economy is tracking before it pulls the rate lever again. Rate hikes boost currencies because they increase the cost of money. The ASX 200 extended its gains by 0.8 per cent with investors also betting on a pause, although real estate firms are lower. Consumer staples did well on the news, but it's banks and big miners that are driving the market today. Banks extended their gains after the numbers came out. ANZ is up 1.5 per cent, while Westpac has put on 1.6 per cent. Even though banks make money from interest rate rises, higher borrowing costs also mean a likely rise in loan defaults.",

We've seen the headline rate : the annual pace of inflation has fallen from 7.8 per cent in the December quarter, to 7 per cent in the March quarter, now to 6 per cent in the June quarter. But underneath that headline figure, we can break it apart to look at what's happening to prices for \"goods\" on one hand, and \"services\" on the other. And there's a lot of divergence there, which this graph shows. The Bureau of Statistics says inflation in the prices for \"services\" has just recorded its largest annual rise since 2001, driven by higher prices in a range of services categories including rents, restaurant meals, holiday travel and insurance. Services inflation is now running at 6.3 per cent, up from 6.1 per cent in the March quarter. So, it's still heading higher. But \"goods\" inflation is definitely heading down. It's running at an annual pace of 5.8 per cent, down from 7.6 per cent in the March quarter, so that's a significant decline. The ABS says price rises for food, furniture, appliances and clothes slowed in the June quarter, while automotive fuel prices were 3.6 per cent lower compared to 12 months ago.",
