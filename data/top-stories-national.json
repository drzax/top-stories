              "plaintext": "First the Fantales, now this. Chocolate company Ernest Hillier has gone into voluntary administration — i t runs the Ernest Hillier and Newman’s brands of chocolate. Workers at its Melbourne plant have been stood down. In a statement it was announced the company had appointed WLP Restructuring Partners, Alan Walker and Glenn Livingstone as voluntary administrators to the company which owns and manufactures Ernest Hillier Chocolates, one of Australia’s’ oldest chocolate brands. Company directors blamed \"rising raw materials and shipping costs significantly impact(ing) margins\" for the decline of the sweet maker. The chocolates are in major supermarket chains Woolworths, Coles, and Aldi and the company also produces 'white-label' chocolates for other providers. So-called 'white label' manufacturing is where you make something on behalf of another company, who then put their own brand on it. Ernest Hillier has a factory in Coburg, Melbourne and the administrators are seeking \"urgent expressions of interest from parties that could recapitalise or acquire the business\" and its assets and brands. WLP Restructuring Partner, Alan Walker, said it was a tough situation. “It’s unfortunate that such a storied chocolate manufacturer has encountered distress amid rising operating costs, but we are working with all stakeholders to do everything possible to save this iconic brand.” “We are working closely with all affected parties as we move with urgency to understand the business’s affairs and find a suitable buyer or investor. While this process is underway, we have had to make the unfortunate decision to cease manufacturing activity and stand down employees at this stage. However, this dedicated workforce is available and keen to restart production.” “The Company operates a significant manufacturing facility in Coburg, and the Ernest Hillier and Newman’s brands have featured on the shelves of Australia’s supermarkets for many years. We expect these supply agreements, alongside its relationships with large multi-national food and beverage providers, may appeal to potential suitors.” The first statutory meeting of creditors will be held on 30 June 2023. The news comes the day after it was revealed that iconic treat Fantales would no longer be made, a victim of declining popularity and old machinery requiring big investments to keep running.",
