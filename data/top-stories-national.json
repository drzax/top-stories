Lewis Miller, who came on as a substitute last week, gets his first international start, while fellow full-back Jordan Bos starts ahead of Ryan Strain. And in great news for 2015 men's Asian Cup enthusiasts everywhere, we're about to see the glorious return of Massimo Luongo in midfield in place of Jackson Irvine. It's his first Socceroos start since 2019. As for New Zealand, there are four changes from their 1-1 draw against Congo last month, with an unfortunate last-minute calf strain to former Wellington Phoenix man Sarpreet Singh ruling him out of this game. Perhaps the most recognisable player is Nottingham Forest striker Chris Wood, who's been on a scoring tear recently and starts up front. What do you make of these changes, beloved blog-readers? Has Arnold made the right calls here? Who are you excited to see? Log in and tell me your predictions!",

The \"Soccer Ashes\" are one of Australian football's oldest and most important objects: a small, hand-made wooden box containing the ashes of two cigars smoked by Alex Gibb and George Campbell, the first captains of Australia and New Zealand, after they contested their first ever 'A' international match in June of 1923. The trophy itself is beautiful, lovingly carved with a combination of New Zealand and Australian woods and adorned with iconic images of a kangaroo and two silver ferns in brass on the lid. Inside the box, the ashes are kept in a small silver razor case that belonged to Private William Fisher, a former secretary of the Queensland Football Association, who carried the case with him when he landed at Gallipoli in 1915. The trophy travelled back and forth between Australia and New Zealand for 30 years, paying homage to their shared wartime origin story, until it disappeared entirely in 1954. Only through the persistence and passion of a handful of historians, coupled with the backing of Football Australia and government funding, were the \"Soccer Ashes\" finally unearthed in a dusty garage earlier this year. You can read more about the history of the trophy, why it disappeared, and how they tracked it down in my story linked below. Grab a cuppa - it's a great yarn. Having a trophy to play for also means that a draw in this morning's game will not suffice - there needs to be a winner, so get ready for your memories of The Peru Game to potentially come flooding back!",
