A NASA spacecraft will fly by Earth on Sunday and drop off what is expected to be at least a cupful of rubble it grabbed from the asteroid Bennu, closing out a seven-year quest. The sample capsule will parachute into the Utah desert, US, as its mothership, the Osiris-Rex spacecraft, zooms off for an encounter with another asteroid. Scientists anticipate getting about 250 grams of pebbles and dust, much more than the teaspoon or so brought back by Japan from two other asteroids. No other country has fetched pieces of asteroids. These preserved time capsules from the dawn of our solar system could help explain how Earth — and life — came to be. University of Arizona’s Dante Lauretta is the mission’s lead scientist. “I ask myself how many heart-pounding moments can you have in one lifetime because I feel like I might be hitting my limit,” she says.",

US markets all took losses overnight. The Dow Jones lost a touch over 1%, the Nasdaq lost 1.8%, and the S & P500 lost 1.6%. And if we look at the global stock market indices, the board is a sea of red, as they say, except for the volatility index (which is up 15%). So we'll see what happens locally today. Remember, yesterday Australia's market closed down by 1.4%, at 7,065.2 points, which was the lowest level since July 11. Rupert Murdoch has announced he is stepping down as chairman of Fox Corp and News Corp, and handing the reins to his son Lachlan. There'll be a lot of news on that topic today.",
