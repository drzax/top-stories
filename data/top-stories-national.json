Qantas is appealing a ruling that found outsourcing ground crew jobs during the pandemic was illegal. The Federal Court has twice ruled in favour of the Transport Workers Union, who say the outsourcing decision breached the Fair Work Act. Qantas has told the High Court that it gave the union and workers the chance to come up with an alternative plan, but their proposed savings were dwarfed by the $100 million that outsourcing would achieve. The airline also said its decision was made at a time where workers had \"less muscle\" for industrial action because they weren't working. The Transport Workers Union told reporters today that half of the 1700 ground staff sacked by Qantas in 2020 are yet to find meaningful work, while a third are suffering mental distress. TWU national secretary, Michael Kaine, says Qantas should be compensating workers, instead of \"spending eye watering amounts in legal warfare.\" \"The Transport Workers Union, and we understand the Minister for Industrial Relations, will ask the court to dismiss the case.\" \"In essence, we'll be saying that the Fair Work Act is designed to protect workers, allow them to exercise their workplace rights, not give companies like Qantas open slather to sack workers.\" Here's the background from High Court reporter Elizabeth Byrne."

Spending on infrastructure is the big ticket item, with a record $2.1 billion spend next financial year, mainly on transport. The budget doesn't factor in potential revenue from big projects like fracking, which have not been given the green light. However, the forecast surplus relies on major projects going ahead, in particular, Santos' controversial Barossa gas project in the Timor Sea, which is being challenged by traditional owners. Here's more from the ABC's Matt Garrick."

                  "articleBody": "There's more signs of the strain that higher interest rates are putting on households. The latest quarterly data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics shows that retail sales fell 0.6 per cent over the first few months of the year to $96.17 billion, following a 0.3 per cent fall over the December quarter. ABS head of retail statistics Ben Dorber says retail sales volumes dropped as the higher cost of living pressures weighed on household spending. “Outside of the COVID-19 pandemic period, this is the largest fall in retail sales volumes since the September quarter 2009,” Mr Dorber said. \"Retail prices rose for the sixth straight quarter, but price growth this quarter is the smallest since September 2021.\" That was because of discounts on clothing and large household items like furniture and electronic goods. Food prices went up, and sales at cafes, restaurants, and takeaway food services rose, boosted by the return of cultural and sporting events."

They were used by then opposition leader Bill Hayden during a Labor Party leadership spill in February 1983. Mr Hayden resigned as party leader and then shadow industrial relations minister Bob Hawke was elected as leader. Afterwards Mr Hayden said \"a drover's dog could lead the Labor Party to victory, the way the country is.\" The Labor party won the election and Mr Hawke became prime minister. So Mr Taylor's inspiration comes from the Labor Party! Here's more on the budget and the \"drover's dog\" from senior business correspondent Peter Ryan."

                  "articleBody": "It's been a big week for bank profits, and the Commonwealth Bank is the last big bank to announce its results. CBA March quarter profit: $2.6 billion unaudited net profit, up from $2.3 billion last year $2.6 billion cash profit, up 10 per cent from December quarter Net interest income down 2 per cent because of mortgage market competition Expenses up 7 per cent because of higher compensation costs $223 million loan impairments Cash earnings were better than expected as higher home and business lending offset squeezed profit margins because of tough competition for loans. CBA says there were \"continued competitive pressure in home loan pricing and customers switching to higher yielding deposits.\" \"Competition for home loans has remained intense in Australia and New Zealand.\" Home lending rose $6.9 billion over the quarter, household deposits were up $6.2 billion, and business lending increased by $2.6 billion. But troubled and impaired assets rose to $6.7 billion, up from $6.3 billion at the end of 2023. The bank says home loan arrears remain low at 0.44 per cent (+0.01 per cent), but consumer finance arrears increased during the quarter with personal loan (+ 0.14 per cent) and credit card (+0.05 per cent) arrears rising. \"We expect to see further increases in arrears rates as the full effects of interest rate increases are borne by borrowers in the month's ahead,\" the bank said. CBA chief executive Matt Comyn says higher interest rates are hurting customers and he expects the economy to slow down. \"Many of our customers are feeling the strain of higher interest rates and the rising cost of living,\" he said. \"As higher interest rates impact the Australian economy in the period ahead, we expect economic growth to continue to moderate.\" \"Despite the challenging global economic outlook, Australia is relatively well positioned given the strength of our banking system, the economic tailwinds from a recovery in population growth, and relatively high commodity prices.\""

                  "articleBody": "Hi team, Before we get lost in Budget chat, let's not let pass up big news from last night. Boss steps down Tom Seymour, the CEO of consulting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), stepped down last night in the middle of a growing scandal. Here's the summary of the mind-blowing scandal, backed up by emails published as part of a Senate inqury. What happened The government asked a PwC tax expert to help it write laws to better tax multinational companies. That expert - Peter-John Collins - used the secret knowledge to help PwC create a system for those companies to avoid paying the new taxes. The company used the scheme to make money and win new clients, and then gloated about it. Booted It came to light when former partner Peter-John Collins was banned by the Tax Practitioners Board disqualified him for a two year period because he \"did not act with integrity\" and \"failed to have in place adequate arrangements to manage conflicts of interest\". Multinational companies sometimes use a complex and expensive process of 'profit-shifting' to take money they've made in higher-taxing countries like Australia to countries like Singapore and The Netherlands where company tax rates are lower. The process is legal, but controversial. Boss gone too Mr Seymour has attempted to minimise the scope of the people involved in the scandal. New documents revealed more people - including him - were aware of the information. (Some may not have been aware of the way in which the information about the new laws came to be in their possession - through Peter-John Collins breaching confidentiality provisions). As of last night, Mr Seymour is no longer CEO. Here's some of the statement. After discussion with the PwC Australia Board of Partners, Tom Seymour is stepping down as CEO, effective immediately. We have appointed our Assurance Leader, Kristin Stubbins, to serve as acting CEO. In the coming months a new CEO will be elected by the Partners. We agreed with Tom that this is in the best interests of the firm and our stakeholders. Given the federal government is the biggest client of PwC and there's currently a Senate hearing into use of consultants by the public service the timing couldn't have been worse."

Disappointing company profit reports weighed on the market with drug manufacturer Catalent (-25.7 per cent) tanking after warning of a $US400 million cut to its annual revenue and profit forecasts. Meanwhile, Tyson Foods slumped (-16.4 per cent) after making a loss over the second quarter. The Dow Jones index fell 0.2 per cent, the S & P 500 was flat, while the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.2 per cent. And as Australian investors await tonight's federal budget, the ASX SPI 200 is down 0.1 per cent, indicating a slow start for the local share market. So join me today for all the markets news."

Qantas is appealing a ruling that found outsourcing ground crew jobs during the pandemic was illegal. The Federal Court has twice ruled in favour of the Transport Workers Union, who say the outsourcing decision breached the Fair Work Act. Qantas has told the High Court that it gave the union and workers the chance to come up with an alternative plan, but their proposed savings were dwarfed by the $100 million that outsourcing would achieve. The airline also said its decision was made at a time where workers had \"less muscle\" for industrial action because they weren't working. The Transport Workers Union told reporters today that half of the 1700 ground staff sacked by Qantas in 2020 are yet to find meaningful work, while a third are suffering mental distress. TWU national secretary, Michael Kaine, says Qantas should be compensating workers, instead of \"spending eye watering amounts in legal warfare.\" \"The Transport Workers Union, and we understand the Minister for Industrial Relations, will ask the court to dismiss the case.\" \"In essence, we'll be saying that the Fair Work Act is designed to protect workers, allow them to exercise their workplace rights, not give companies like Qantas open slather to sack workers.\" Here's the background from High Court reporter Elizabeth Byrne.",

The budget doesn't factor in potential revenue from big projects like fracking, which have not been given the green light. However, the forecast surplus relies on major projects going ahead, in particular, Santos' controversial Barossa gas project in the Timor Sea, which is being challenged by traditional owners.

The latest quarterly data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics shows that retail sales fell 0.6 per cent over the first few months of the year to $96.17 billion, following a 0.3 per cent fall over the December quarter. ABS head of retail statistics Ben Dorber says retail sales volumes dropped as the higher cost of living pressures weighed on household spending. “Outside of the COVID-19 pandemic period, this is the largest fall in retail sales volumes since the September quarter 2009,” Mr Dorber said. \"Retail prices rose for the sixth straight quarter, but price growth this quarter is the smallest since September 2021.\" That was because of discounts on clothing and large household items like furniture and electronic goods. Food prices went up, and sales at cafes, restaurants, and takeaway food services rose, boosted by the return of cultural and sporting events.",

CBA March quarter profit: $2.6 billion unaudited net profit, up from $2.3 billion last year $2.6 billion cash profit, up 10 per cent from December quarter Net interest income down 2 per cent because of mortgage market competition Expenses up 7 per cent because of higher compensation costs $223 million loan impairments Cash earnings were better than expected as higher home and business lending offset squeezed profit margins because of tough competition for loans. CBA says there were \"continued competitive pressure in home loan pricing and customers switching to higher yielding deposits.\" \"Competition for home loans has remained intense in Australia and New Zealand.\" Home lending rose $6.9 billion over the quarter, household deposits were up $6.2 billion, and business lending increased by $2.6 billion. But troubled and impaired assets rose to $6.7 billion, up from $6.3 billion at the end of 2023. The bank says home loan arrears remain low at 0.44 per cent (+0.01 per cent), but consumer finance arrears increased during the quarter with personal loan (+ 0.14 per cent) and credit card (+0.05 per cent) arrears rising. \"We expect to see further increases in arrears rates as the full effects of interest rate increases are borne by borrowers in the month's ahead,\" the bank said. CBA chief executive Matt Comyn says higher interest rates are hurting customers and he expects the economy to slow down. \"Many of our customers are feeling the strain of higher interest rates and the rising cost of living,\" he said. \"As higher interest rates impact the Australian economy in the period ahead, we expect economic growth to continue to moderate.\" \"Despite the challenging global economic outlook, Australia is relatively well positioned given the strength of our banking system, the economic tailwinds from a recovery in population growth, and relatively high commodity prices.\"",

Boss steps down Tom Seymour, the CEO of consulting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), stepped down last night in the middle of a growing scandal. Here's the summary of the mind-blowing scandal, backed up by emails published as part of a Senate inqury. What happened The government asked a PwC tax expert to help it write laws to better tax multinational companies. That expert - Peter-John Collins - used the secret knowledge to help PwC create a system for those companies to avoid paying the new taxes. The company used the scheme to make money and win new clients, and then gloated about it. Booted It came to light when former partner Peter-John Collins was banned by the Tax Practitioners Board disqualified him for a two year period because he \"did not act with integrity\" and \"failed to have in place adequate arrangements to manage conflicts of interest\". Multinational companies sometimes use a complex and expensive process of 'profit-shifting' to take money they've made in higher-taxing countries like Australia to countries like Singapore and The Netherlands where company tax rates are lower. The process is legal, but controversial. Boss gone too Mr Seymour has attempted to minimise the scope of the people involved in the scandal. New documents revealed more people - including him - were aware of the information. (Some may not have been aware of the way in which the information about the new laws came to be in their possession - through Peter-John Collins breaching confidentiality provisions). As of last night, Mr Seymour is no longer CEO. Here's some of the statement. After discussion with the PwC Australia Board of Partners, Tom Seymour is stepping down as CEO, effective immediately. We have appointed our Assurance Leader, Kristin Stubbins, to serve as acting CEO. In the coming months a new CEO will be elected by the Partners. We agreed with Tom that this is in the best interests of the firm and our stakeholders. Given the federal government is the biggest client of PwC and there's currently a Senate hearing into use of consultants by the public service the timing couldn't have been worse.",

Wall Street was lacklustre overnight after Friday's stellar performance thanks to a fall in the US unemployment rate, and Apple's better than expected quarterly earnings. Disappointing company profit reports weighed on the market with drug manufacturer Catalent (-25.7 per cent) tanking after warning of a $US400 million cut to its annual revenue and profit forecasts. Meanwhile, Tyson Foods slumped (-16.4 per cent) after making a loss over the second quarter. The Dow Jones index fell 0.2 per cent, the S & P 500 was flat, while the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.2 per cent. And as Australian investors await tonight's federal budget, the ASX SPI 200 is down 0.1 per cent, indicating a slow start for the local share market. So join me today for all the markets news.",

Qantas is appealing a ruling that found outsourcing ground crew jobs during the pandemic was illegal. The Federal Court has twice ruled in favour of the Transport Workers Union, who say the outsourcing decision breached the Fair Work Act. Qantas has told the High Court that it gave the union and workers the chance to come up with an alternative plan, but their proposed savings were dwarfed by the $100 million that outsourcing would achieve. The airline also said its decision was made at a time where workers had \"less muscle\" for industrial action because they weren't working. The Transport Workers Union told reporters today that half of the 1700 ground staff sacked by Qantas in 2020 are yet to find meaningful work, while a third are suffering mental distress. TWU national secretary, Michael Kaine, says Qantas should be compensating workers, instead of \"spending eye watering amounts in legal warfare.\" \"The Transport Workers Union, and we understand the Minister for Industrial Relations, will ask the court to dismiss the case.\" \"In essence, we'll be saying that the Fair Work Act is designed to protect workers, allow them to exercise their workplace rights, not give companies like Qantas open slather to sack workers.\" Here's the background from High Court reporter Elizabeth Byrne.",
