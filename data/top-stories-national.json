Both major indexes here are making strong gains on open, with both the All Ords and ASX 200 surging 0.8% on open. The biggest gains are in mining, including iron ore and lithium. A note from ANZ this morning speaks to why those stocks in particular are gaining, and it includes China. Its analysts noted that new home prices in 70 cities across mainland China have risen slightly, according to its National Bureau of Statistics. \"Price gains for new homes in China (boosted) sentiment in the iron ore market. The market is hoping this is a harbinger to a pick-up in steel output,\" ANZ notes. \"Signs that the destocking cycle in China has passed has boosted sentiment across the lithium market. \"Lithium carbonate prices in China have jumped more than 15% this week amid signs of improvement in the electric vehicle (EV) sector. \"China will speed up the building of power charging facilities for EVs in rural areas so they will be available in every province. \"Tesla has also raised prices for some models in recent weeks, raising hopes the recent price war has ended.\" Meanwhile, we have losses on the ASX in the gas industry and some retail stocks, including Lovisa. This is all ahead of the jobs data set to be released by the ABS at 11:30am AEST. We know that the Reserve Bank will be closely watching this data for signs that its ploy to tackle inflation is working or not. Here's a take by our colleague Peter Ryan. We'll also have my colleague Michael Janda on deck as the ABS jobs data is being released to answer your questions. Start sending them through on the comments!",

While you were sleeping, there was a bounce of optimism in the United States, as its citizens were reassured by their president that \"America will not default\". \"I’m confident that we'll get the agreement on the budget,\" Joe Biden added. The United States is facing the prospect of defaulting on trillions of dollars worth of loans, unless the Republicans and Democrats strike a deal to legally allow the US Department of Treasury to incur more debt, which would allow it to pay its bills. US Treasury officials say that, unless a deal is reached, the US risks running out of money to pay its debts as soon as June 1, and this could trigger a recession, sparking fears of a global economic and financial crisis. But those comments by Biden have seemed to soothe equity markets there, at least, for now. And of course, Australian shares are set to follow. Meanwhile, the US dollar rose overnight, pushing the Australian currency against the greenback slightly down to 66.62 US cents. Let's hope those sixes aren't ominous. Here in Australia, we have labour force data out at 11:30am AEST. Will Australia’s unemployment remain steady at near a 50 year low of 3.5 per cent, or will we start to get an uptick as interest rates crimp demand? We'll be here keeping you updated.",
