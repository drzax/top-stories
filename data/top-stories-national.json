NAB's economists are making that call given their Business Survey showed that the retail industry outlook has recently softened.

Here's their reasoning: \"While the May retail  figure was stronger than expected, this reflected the earlier timing of end  of financial year sales. \" We expect some pullback occurred in June, but if  sales events stretched into later weeks, the pullback could instead occur  in July. \"Our internal CBA card spending data indicate that retail spending  rose by 0.3% in June. \"While our spending data closely tracks the official  ABS estimates, it has been slightly stronger of late. \"This likely reflects  CBA banking a large share of new migrants, which adds to overall  spending on CBA cards.\"",
