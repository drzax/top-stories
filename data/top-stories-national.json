As the BBC reports, the 28-year-old singer has been charged under his real name, Tyron Kaymone Frampton. He appeared before court on Tuesday via video link from his home. Frampton has been charged with two counts of raping a woman in September 2021. In a statement on social media, Frampton says he denies the charges. \"I am innocent and I am confident my name will be cleared,\" he says, before asking fans not to comment about the situation. Frampton is expected to appear before Oxford Crown Court on 15 June. His latest Slowthai album Ugly came out in March this year.",
