And yes, we at ASIC have been calling on the superannuation industry to make sure that they do have the right processes and systems in place to meet these obligations.\" But Ms Court declined to say how big a penalty ASIC was seeking over the issue, but expects it to be substantial. \"It's an early stage ... I think, suffice to say, there is the potential for very significant penalties to be imposed in relation to this conduct,\" she said. \"But that is down the track and we will wait and see where we get to in the court proceedings.\"",
