At least six people are confirmed to have died following the blaze at Loafers Lodge in the suburb of Newtown, but others remain unaccounted for. The scene is set to be handed to police by Fire and Emergency New Zealand, after \"an extensive health and safety assessment and the mitigation of any identified risks\". Acting Wellington District Commander, Inspector Dion Bennett, says entering the building is a \"critical step\" in the police investigation. Police say they will be \"unable to provide any definitive comment on the number of deceased\" until the scene is extensively examined. \"We know this is an incredibly difficult time for those waiting for information regarding family members and friends who may have been staying at Loafers Lodge at the time of the fire,\" Bennett says. \"I want to reassure everyone impacted by the fire that we will work as quickly as we can to provide the answers you need. \"We have a large number of staff dedicated to this operation, with specialist staff being brought into Wellington from around the country to assist.\" Bennett says police will be talking to evacuated residents again today, and have already secured and reviewed CCTV footage from the area around the hostel. \"Work is also ongoing to determine who was in the building at the time of the fire and who remains unaccounted for or uncontactable,\" he says.",

Overnight, Wall Street finished lower after softer than expected retail sales data showed consumer spending is weakening. It followed a stark warning from US Treasury Secretary J anet Yellen on the US debt ceiling crisis that caused President Joe Biden to postpone his inaugural visit to Australia, saying that a recession would be likely if the US defaulted on its debt. \"Our economy would suddenly find itself in an unprecedented economic and financial storm,\" Yellen said in remarks to the Independent Community Bankers of America. \"And the resulting income shock could lead to a recession that destroys many American jobs and businesses. \"Time is running out. Every single day that Congress does not act, we are experiencing increased economic costs that could slow down the U.S. economy.\" Back home, the Australian share market is set to follow Wall Street's lead and open lower. Later this morning we'll get the latest figures on wages, which will be a key piece of data the Reserve Bank will take into account ahead of next month's interest rate decision. The wages data will also give us an indication of how far behind Australians are as inflation remains high at 7%. There's a bit to unpack, so let's crack on, shall we?",
