Under the settlement, Tabcorp will be refunded around $83 million, which accounts for 20% of the disputed tax liabilities and interest, while the proceedings brought by the ATO will also be dismissed. Tabcorp will pay around $37 million to The Lottery Corporation (TLC) as part of a separation deed between the two companies, dated March 25 last year. All up, Tabcorp says it will see a post-tax benefit of approximately $45 million in its financial statements at the end of the 2024 financial year, and will be treated as a significant item.",
