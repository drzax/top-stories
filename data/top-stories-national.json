They're included in the budget as they have been for some time and we have no plans to change those measures. We haven't given consideration to that,\" Prime Minister Anthony Albanese replies. \"Do you see how some people see $69 billion for tax cuts targeting in large part wealthy Australians compared to only $15 billion for cost of living?\" Rowland repeats. \"Those measures begin at $45,000, if you're on $45,000, watching this program, you don't regard yourself as being wealthy,\" Albanese replies."

They don't come in for more than a year now. They haven't actually been a focus of the deliberations for this budget at all.\"",

She aded there was another missed opportunity to tackle the structural deficit. \"Business did all the heavy lifting last night and there is nothing to drive our investment against the backdrop of other countries who are pushing hard into this. \"The hard work is fixing and reforming government services. By that, not cost cutting but going to digital services, getting improved outcomes for people, making sure we slow the rate of growth in these services, that they are efficient and effective for people and fix all of the issues in our federation.\"",
