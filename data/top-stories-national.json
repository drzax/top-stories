Elon Musk's Tesla is being sued by the US version of FairWork for \"tolerating widespread and ongoing racial harassment of its Black employees\" from at least 2015 until today. The lawsuit was just filed by the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. The regulator's suit contains some very concerning allegations that workers in its California factory endured racial abuse, stereotyping, and vilificaton including a range of racial slurs. \"Slurs were used casually and openly in high-traffic areas and at worker hubs,\" they allege. It further alleges that workers faced graffiti around the factory that depicted racial abuse, \"including variations of the N-word, swastikas, threats, and nooses, on desks and other equipment\". This graffiti was even allegedly found on new electric cars as they were rolling off the production line. Further, it found people who raised objections to this, faced retaliation including being fired. The case was lodged by the EEOC's office in the tech hub of Silicon Valley and is being led by former FBI lawyer James Baker. Tesla has been contacted for comment. This suit follows another lawsuit by Californian-based regulators about similiar issues. Earlier this year, Tesla agreed to pay one worker several million dollars after a federal jury found it failed to prevent severe racial harassment at the Californian plant.
