Determined and talented and with plenty of grit, Jock was born in Glasgow to an Italian father and a Scottish mother, which meant his formative years were heavily influenced by two strong cultures and it was his obsession with food and desire for a new pushbike that at just 12 years old fuelled Jock to knock on kitchen doors looking for a job. Jock’s love and passion for food saw him become one of the youngest culinary students to do an apprenticeship at The Turnberry Hotel at just 15 years of age. From that point onwards there was no holding him back and by 17 he was working alongside Marco Pierre White at his eponymous Restaurant Macro Pierre White. Throughout his career he worked with world famous chefs and in restaurants all over the world. His talent saw him shine in the world’s most formidable kitchens and he opened Bistro Blackwood and Restaurant Orana in Adelaide after moving to Australia. Jock’s Restaurant Orana was recognised with the coveted distinction of three hats in both 2019 and 2020 and he also received global accolades, accepting the prestigious Basque Culinary World Prize in 2018. In 2019, Jock was named as a judge on MasterChef Australia in which he took great pride in challenging and coaching the contestants and of course inspiring a nation of home cooks."

Determined and talented and with plenty of grit, Jock was born in Glasgow to an Italian father and a Scottish mother, which meant his formative years were heavily influenced by two strong cultures and it was his obsession with food and desire for a new pushbike that at just 12 years old fuelled Jock to knock on kitchen doors looking for a job. Jock’s love and passion for food saw him become one of the youngest culinary students to do an apprenticeship at The Turnberry Hotel at just 15 years of age. From that point onwards there was no holding him back and by 17 he was working alongside Marco Pierre White at his eponymous Restaurant Macro Pierre White. Throughout his career he worked with world famous chefs and in restaurants all over the world. His talent saw him shine in the world’s most formidable kitchens and he opened Bistro Blackwood and Restaurant Orana in Adelaide after moving to Australia. Jock’s Restaurant Orana was recognised with the coveted distinction of three hats in both 2019 and 2020 and he also received global accolades, accepting the prestigious Basque Culinary World Prize in 2018. In 2019, Jock was named as a judge on MasterChef Australia in which he took great pride in challenging and coaching the contestants and of course inspiring a nation of home cooks.",

They 'compete' but the heft of the largest ones - in market power, pricing power, marketing power and more - makes it pretty tough for their competitors. New data from the prudential regulator APRA shows just how substantial that heft is. The 'Big Four' - ANZ, Commonwealth Bank (CBA) NAB and Westpac (WBC)' - are unable to merge with or takeover each other. Check out their share of the mortgage market, they're the four on the left. Together it's 75.1% - more than three-quarters of all home loans in the nation. Fighting over the rest are Bendigo and Adelaide Bank (BEN) Bank of Queensland (BOQ) Macquarie (MQC) and others."

I know the markets in the US were up on Friday but this is the day before the RBA meeting and for the past few months investors have been really cautious the day before the RBA meeting.  Is this a sign that they think rates will remain the same? Is this uptick because of the US markets?  Or is there some secret alchemy at work, like Mars is transversing Venus while the sea urchins mate in Turkey?  - Trying to find rhyme or reason. The ASX 200 is up 0.5% in morning trade, lifting 41 points to be 7,350.20 points. The broader All Ordinaries Index of the biggest 500 companies is up 0.5% too, rising 40.5 points to be 7,541.50 points But why? This is a good question. Our commentator makes some solids suggestions as to why. The real answer is: no-one knows. The market is composed of millions of transactions where people transfer the ownership of stocks. There aren't really 'more buyers than sellers' as you sometimes hear - one must meet the other to make the trade, so the number is the same. All of this leans towards the Mars/Venus/Turkish sea urchins theory being the best answer."

The biggest bank in the nation, the Commonwealth Bank, has put out its preview of next Tuesday's budget and it spells out some assumptions that will help you frame the size of the challenge facing the nation. Here's what the bank says the government is trying to do, at the same time: maintaining fiscal discipline to assist monetary policy in bringing inflation back to the 2%-3% target range providing some targeted relief to cost-of-living pressures putting in place new arrangements to reverse the projected blowout in spending on a number of large programs (ie. NDIS, Aged care) implementing the AUKUS defence policy priorities further developing climate change policies implementing some tax reform and moving the medium-term budget outlook onto a more sustainable footing And don't forget — win the next election so you can start working on the really hard stuff! That said, there's some good news for Treasurer Jim Chalmers. There was a budget last year — in October 2022 — to enact a lot of election promises. The 2022/23 budget deficit is expected to come in well below the estimate that was made then. Data to March shows the 2022/23 deficit running at $A11.2 billion \"a substantial $A23.3 billion lower than expectations\". If you roll it over 12 months like in this chart, the budget is back to a (very) small surplus — mainly thanks to the strong labour market and company profits."

I know the markets in the US were up on Friday but this is the day before the RBA meeting and for the past few months investors have been really cautious the day before the RBA meeting.  Is this a sign that they think rates will remain the same? Is this uptick because of the US markets?  Or is there some secret alchemy at work, like Mars is transversing Venus while the sea urchins mate in Turkey?  - Trying to find rhyme or reason. The ASX 200 is up 0.5% in morning trade, lifting 41 points to be 7,350.20 points. The broader All Ordinaries Index of the biggest 500 companies is up 0.5% too, rising 40.5 points to be 7,541.50 points But why? This is a good question. Our commentator makes some solids suggestions as to why. The real answer is: no-one knows. The market is composed of millions of transactions where people transfer the ownership of stocks. There aren't really 'more buyers than sellers' as you sometimes hear - one must meet the other to make the trade, so the number is the same. All of this leans towards the Mars/Venus/Turkish sea urchins theory being the best answer.",

The biggest bank in the nation, the Commonwealth Bank, has put out its preview of next Tuesday's budget and it spells out some assumptions that will help you frame the size of the challenge facing the nation. Here's what the bank says the government is trying to do, at the same time: maintaining fiscal discipline to assist monetary policy in bringing inflation back to the 2%-3% target range providing some targeted relief to cost-of-living pressures putting in place new arrangements to reverse the projected blowout in spending on a number of large programs (ie. NDIS, Aged care) implementing the AUKUS defence policy priorities further developing climate change policies implementing some tax reform and moving the medium-term budget outlook onto a more sustainable footing And don't forget — win the next election so you can start working on the really hard stuff! That said, there's some good news for Treasurer Jim Chalmers. There was a budget last year — in October 2022 — to enact a lot of election promises. The 2022/23 budget deficit is expected to come in well below the estimate that was made then. Data to March shows the 2022/23 deficit running at $A11.2 billion \"a substantial $A23.3 billion lower than expectations\". If you roll it over 12 months like in this chart, the budget is back to a (very) small surplus — mainly thanks to the strong labour market and company profits.",
