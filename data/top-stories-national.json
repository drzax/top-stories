However, the bigger picture is that the benchmark index is down 1.4% since the year began. So that means, overall, the local share market has erased all the gains it made in 2023. Healthcare was the only sector which traded higher today, driven by Neuren Pharmaceuticals (+2.3%) and CSL (+1%). On this overwhelmingly negative day, 180 out of 200 stocks finished in the red (so that's most of them). Mining and energy stocks were among the worst performers, including Sayona Mining (-9.5%), Paladin Energy (-5.9%), Beach Energy (-5.5%) and Mineral Resources (-5%). The Australian dollar also experienced heavy losses â down 0.8% to 63.12 US cents. (That's on top of the 1.1% drop it suffered overnight). So the local currency is now trading at its weakest level since November last year. Just to give you an idea of how steep that drop is, the Aussie dollar was buying 64 US cents yesterday afternoon!",
