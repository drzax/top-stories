The state and federal governments have ratified funding arrangements for a so-called \"hydrogen hub\" at Port Bonython, committing to a combined $100 million spend, in addition to private sector funding. The location, in South Australia's Upper Spencer Gulf region, was earmarked by the previous federal government before last year's election for future hydrogen projects. Among them is what Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has described as a \"large-scale export terminal\" for \"green\" hydrogen. The government expects the local industry to produce as much as 1.8 million tonnes of hydrogen by 2030, and said it could also power steel production at the nearby Whyalla steelworks, which is owned by British billionaire Sanjeev Gupta.
