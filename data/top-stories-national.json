Total superannuation assets are projected to almost triple to more than $9 trillion by 2041, according to a report by Deloitte. But as the influence of superannuation funds — economically and politically — continues to grow, transparency over how member money gets used becomes crucial. In 2021, the banking regulator found there was at times a lack of evidence to assess the benefits of marketing by super funds, including whether it resulted in improved outcomes for members. It's an important question to ask as the federal government moves to revamp the $3.5 trillion secto r and examines the lucrative tax breaks that predominately benefit the wealthy.
