Mr Mundine's response: As I said, it's a canvass, that 439 words on the front page where the signatures are. And also the 28 pages behind that. The 28 pages behind that, if people read them, and you go through it. And I'm currently, I've got a full article critique of that, of what's on the cover and what's the 28 pages behind. The 28 pages is about the manifesto of how it's going to be put in place and how it's going to be operated, and in that, they put their ideas of the ten points that need to be raised. And they cover a whole wide range of things that people can't get away from and it does talk about sovereignty and it does talk about treaties and it talks about a whole wide range of other things that are in that document. So you just can't ignore that page, those 28 pages. And that's where it comes at. Because it is a challenge to Australian society. For context the statement is one-page long and claims about a longer version of the Uluru Statement stem from a Freedom of information release by the National Indigenous Australians Agency (NIAA) of drafting notes and meeting outcomes from preparatory work for the Uluru statement. An NIAA spokeswoman told CheckMate that the 26-page document in question contained \"the one-page Uluru Statement from the Heart, followed by 25 pages of background information and excerpts of regional dialogues that informed [it]\".",

The Australian lender falsely indicated to customers that they could rely on a 'cash advance' from funds stated to be their 'Available Funds' without incurring fees and interest. The error resulted in customers being charged with thousands of dollars in fees while the average remediation paid was around $45 per affected account, according to the Australian Securities & Investments Commission (ASIC) — the regulator which sued ANZ. \"Many ANZ customers relied on the account information displayed by the bank and were charged fees that were inconsistent with that information,\" said ASIC deputy chair Sarah Court.

The leader on the ASX today is medical imaging company Pro Medicus after securing a $140 million, 10-year contract with the largest not-for-profit healthcare system in Texas, Baylor Scott & White Health. Its shares jumped 9.3 per cent at the open, but have pared back a little to 9 per cent — to be valued at $77.62 a share, shortly after 11am AEST. Pro Medicus will supply cloud-engineered imaging services, starting in the first quarter of 2024. \"Baylor Scott & White Health joins our impressive list of IDN and Tier 1 academic clients and represents our first major client in Texas.\" Dr Sam Hupert, the chief executive of Pro Medicus, told the market: \"The scale and scope of our initiative with Baylor Scott & White Health is noteworthy and will include nearly 500 radiologists who will be exposed to the benefits of Visage 7.\"",
