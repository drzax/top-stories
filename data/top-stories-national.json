Jean Carroll, who won a $US5 million ($7.6 million) sex abuse lawsuit against him in May. The judge ruled that Trump can't claim Carroll defamed him by continuing to say she was not only sexually abused but raped. Trump attorney Alina Habba says Trump's lawyers will appeal \"the flawed decision\" to dismiss his counterclaim. Carroll is also pursuing her own defamation suit against Trump. Her lawyer, Robbie Kaplan, says Carroll is pleased with the ruling and looking ahead to a trial scheduled in January in her defamation suit, which concerns a series of remarks that Trump has made in denying her sexual assault allegation. Carroll accuses Trump of trapping her in a luxury department store dressing room in 1996, where the alleged incident occurred. Trump denies any of it happened, and even that they ran into each other at the store. He has accused her of inventing \"a fraudulent and false story\" to sell a memoir.",

Thao previously testified he merely served as a \"human traffic cone\" during the May 25, 2020 incident. Thao spoke at length about his Christian growth during his 340 days behind bars but denied any responsibility for Mr Floyd's death during his sentencing hearing.
