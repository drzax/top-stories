              "plaintext": "The Australian dollar came within a whisker of passing 69 US cents on Friday, for the first time since mid-February, and is on a trajectory towards 70. The fortunes of the Aussie dollar have been largely linked to the relative interest rate outlook between Australia and the US. The US Federal Reserve paused its rate rises last week, with the benchmark rate sitting at 5-5.25%. Many traders expect one more rate hike at most before the Fed is done, with some now believing it is finished, although the Fed itself suggests there might be a couple more. The RBA's cash rate rose a couple of weeks ago to 4.1% in a move that surprised many in the markets. After last week's strong jobs numbers, the RBA is now priced in for at least one more rate hike by August and probably two more before it is done later this year. That would take the cash rate in Australia to 4.6%, which won't be too far behind the US Fed funds rate if the central bank there extends this month's pause over the coming months. That has seen the Australian dollar rise from recent lows around 65 US cents in May when traders thought the Reserve Bank might be done with rate hikes to the current level of 68.66 US cents .",
