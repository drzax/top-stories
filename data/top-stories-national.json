The TWU — which urged SafeWork NSW to prosecute the case against Qantas — says the district court's ruling is the \"first-ever criminal prosecution from the safety regulator against Qantas\" for \"the targeting and the standing down of Health and Safety Representative Theo Seremetidis\". Secretary for the NSW and Queensland divisions of the TWU, Richard Olsen, said Mr Seremetidis was a \"workplace hero\" who has been \"vindicated\" by the court's decision. \"When the TWU urged SafeWork NSW to prosecute this case, Theo courageously took on one of Australia's biggest corporate bullies and won ,\" Mr Olsen said. \"Theo always acted diligently to protect his colleagues, and the evidence brought in this case proved that he thoroughly researched the risks, asked the right questions of his employer, and requested protective equipment and training for workers cleaning planes from COVID hotspots. \"Qantas not only ignored the concerns of Theo and his colleagues, but set out to punish and silence him for acting in his role as a highly trained HSR [health and safety representative]. \"We congratulate Theo and SafeWork NSW for leading this unprecedented prosecution which has inspired others to come forward.\" Secretary of the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU), Sally McManus, echoed the \"hero\" calls. \"As far as the union movement is concerned, Theo is a hero for standing up at great cost to himself to keep the whole of the community safe from a deadly virus at a time where no vaccines were available and when hospitals around the world were being overwhelmed,\" she said in a statement. \"Congratulations to the TWU, who stood by Theo in the dark times and can finally see him win justice.\"",
