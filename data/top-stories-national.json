The accident happened in the desert about 137 kilometers east of Los Angeles and involved a huge Sikorsky S-64E and a smaller Bell 407. The larger Sikorsky plane landed safely. “Unfortunately, the second helicopter crashed and tragically all three members perished,” Cal Fire Southern Region Chief David Fulcher said at a news conference early Monday. The victims were Fire Assistant Chief Josh Bischof, Fire Capt. Tim Rodriguez, and contract pilot Tony Sousa. While battling the blaze, the two helicopters collided just before 7 p.m. The crash caused an additional 4-acre fire, which was extinguished. The crash is being investigated by the National Transportation Safety Board.",
