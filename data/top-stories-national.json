The Australian share market is likely to start its day with solid gains, with ASX futures up 0.9%. That’s despite Wall Street’s main stock indexes making very little progress in either direction (ie. flat) as investors await the latest US inflation figures (on Wednesday AEDT). This data will determine whether the US Federal Reserve will keep interest rates elevated, and its timing for a rate cut – which the market is betting will happen next year. Traders have priced in a nearly 86% chance that the Fed will hold interest rates in December, according to the CME Group's FedWatch tool. Meanwhile, the Australian dollar was slightly higher at 63.8 US cents (after rising 0.2% overnight). Later this morning, NAB and Westpac will release their business conditions and consumer sentiment reports, which provides a useful snapshot of how the economy is tracking. However, the key Australian data to look out for is the ABS’s Wage Price Index and Labour Force report (out on Wednesday and Thursday). Oil prices jumped overnight after the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) published a monthly report which eased worries about waning demand in the United States and China. Brent crude futures rose 1.2% to $US82.43 a barrel. In its report, OPEC said oil market fundamentals remained strong and blamed speculators for a recent drop in prices. OPEC made a slight increase to its 2023 forecast for global oil demand growth and stuck to its relatively high 2024 prediction.",
