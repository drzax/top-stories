                  "articleBody": "The British government has ditched its plan for thousands of EU-era laws to expire automatically at the end of the year. The plan — dubbed a post-Brexit 'bonfire' — would see laws that were copied over to the UK after Brexit vanish, unless specifically kept or replaced. Critics of the bill had voiced concerns that it could lead to important legislation falling away by accident. The backdown is likely to trigger anger from Brexit-backing Conservative MPs."
