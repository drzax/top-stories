The Premier’s comparison of \"appalling\" actions taken by juveniles during a riot at Banksia Hill Detention Centre to “terrorism” has been criticised by those advocating for changes to the way the state deals with juvenile offenders. Questions have been raised about how the role foetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) could have played in the judgment showed by the almost 50 detainees who rioted at the center over 12 hours on Tuesday. But in a post-budget interview given to ABC Radio Perth’s Jo Trilling, the Premier wasn’t having a bar of it. “I stand by what I said. People, including the media, need to stop making excuses for this,” he said. “It's fanciful to suggest that they [don’t] understand that when they break out of their cell, they set fire to things, they assault guards, they bash other people, they know that's wrong. “The idea that somehow they don't know that's wrong is ridiculous.” Mr McGowan said the fact a significant number of these detainees have impairments such as FASD shouldn’t be an excuse for that behaviour. “This is your opportunity to turn your life around. You had a life outside in which you did things you regret and caused immense pain to other people,” he said. “They would not be in detention if they were incapable of pleading or they couldn't form an intent — because the courts have found they can, and that's why they're there.”",

The Bunbury Outer Ring Road project has been allocated another $100 million — lifting the price tag of the road to $1.35 billion. It's initial cost was $852 million and now stands as WA's most expensive ever road project. The Albany Ring Road's budget has been increased by $40 million. $15 million will be added to the budget of the Great Northern Highway (Ord River North) project, while an extra $30 million has been reserved for the duplication of the Bussell Highway. No word on new Broome prison The implementation of a new prison in the Kimberley is no closer, with funding for an upgraded custodial facility in Broome not included in today’s budget, as promised. With the current Broome Regional Prison ageing and in need of replacement, the state government has been investigating potential sites to build a new facility. In February 2022, Corrective Services Minister Bill Johnston announced a preferred prison location in the Broome Road Industrial Park, 10km from the Broome townsite – and stipulated funding for construction would be considered as part of the 2023-24 budget. However, with a section of the Broome community calling for more consultation, the government has been forced back to the drawing board – with the absence of funding in today’s Budget delaying the long-awaited project further.",
