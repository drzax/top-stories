That is quite the substantial turnaround — just last month, the federal government noted its cash underlying surplus was just $8.9 billion, whereas now it's a staggering $20.4 billion. It sure does make that modest $4.2 billion budget surplus we heard about on budget night much, much smaller in comparison.
