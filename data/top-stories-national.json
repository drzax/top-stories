But Google announced Wednesday that Bard will be available to all comers in more than 180 countries and more languages beyond English."

Officials have warned protesters against any further attacks on state installations. At least five people have died in violence that has aggravated instability in the South Asian country as it grapples with a severe economic crisis. Khan — Pakistan's most popular political leader according to polls — was arrested in a fraud case on Tuesday, prompting supporters to storm military buildings and ransack the home of a top army general. The government by Wednesday had approved requests from two of Pakistan's four provinces — Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, both Khan strongholds — and the federal capital Islamabad to deploy troops to restore order."

Marin, 37, the world's youngest prime minister when she took office in 2019, is considered by fans around the globe as a millennial role model for progressive new leaders, even as voters at home opted for a new government."

The 24-year old Queenslander came down with several other riders in wet conditions with 7km remaining of the fifth stage, but amazingly recovered in time to prevail in a sprint finish. It was his second Grand Tour win after claiming a stage during last year's Tour of Spain, and came just two days after Canberra's Michael Matthews took out stage 3 in Italy. Race favourite Remco Evenepoel of Belgium crashed twice on a day marred by dreadful weather, the first time after a dog strayed on to the road."

We will remain best friends,\" they said in separate Instagram stories. The pair share a 5-year-old daughter and got married in 2020 while Marin was in office dealing with the impact of the pandemic. Marin and her Social Democratic Party lost Finland's election for parliament last month, trailing the right-wing National Coalition Party as well as the nationalist Finns Party. Marin, 37, the world's youngest prime minister when she took office in 2019, is considered by fans around the globe as a millennial role model for progressive new leaders, even as voters at home opted for a new government.",

At least five people have died in violence that has aggravated instability in the South Asian country as it grapples with a severe economic crisis. Khan — Pakistan's most popular political leader according to polls — was arrested in a fraud case on Tuesday, prompting supporters to storm military buildings and ransack the home of a top army general. The government by Wednesday had approved requests from two of Pakistan's four provinces — Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, both Khan strongholds — and the federal capital Islamabad to deploy troops to restore order.",

                  "headline": "Wall street mixed on CPI data and debt ceiling worries",
                  "articleBody": "Here's some detail about how the US markets ended up overnight: The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 30.48 points, or 0.09 per cent, to 33,531. The S & P 500 gained 18.47 points, or 0.4 per cent, at 4,137, while the Nasdaq Composite added 126.89 points, or 1 per cent, at 12,306. The Nasdaq was helped by a 4.1 per cent climb in Google's parent company Alphabet as the company rolled out more artificial intelligence for its core search product in response to competition from Microsoft Corp. Large-cap tech stocks including Apple Inc and Microsoft also gained 1.04 per cent and 1.73 per cent, respectively. The rate-sensitive S & P 500 technology sector index went up 1.2 per cent and the communication services rose 1.69 per cent. Markets reacted positively because they saw the inflation data as a small positive, with hopes rising of a rate pause. \"The CPI is indicating some sort of relief in inflationary pressure. That would mean the Fed would be toward the end or already at the end of its interest rate cycle, and growth companies are most heavily affected by higher interest rates,\" Kevin W. Philip, a partner at investment advisor Bel Air said. Fed funds futures traders are pricing in a pause in rate increases at the central bank's June meeting, and less than a 5 per cent chance of another 25 basis point hike. However, investors also had concerns about the looming US debt ceiling. Talks on raising the US federal government's $US31.4 trillion debt ceiling entered a new phase on Wednesday as some areas of potential compromise emerged after Tuesday's White House meeting. Regional bank shares extended declines from volatile sessions last week on concerns about the sector's health. PacWest Bancorp fell 0.5 per cent, and Zions Bancorporation fell 2.7 per cent respectively. Oil and gas producer Occidental Petroleum Corp fell 3.6 per cent after its first-quarter earnings fell short of analysts' estimates. Livent Corp rose 5.2 per cent after Australian lithium miner Allkem Ltd agreed to merge with the US-based chemical manufacturing firm to create a $US10.6 billion firm. Airbnb Inc 10.9 per cent as the vacation rental booking company had fewer bookings and lower average daily rates in the second quarter. Rivian Automotive jumped 1.8 per cent after the electrical vehicle maker beat estimates for its first-quarter results and reiterated its annual production forecast. - with Reuters"

The Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 0.4 per cent last month after gaining 0.1 per cent in March. The increase was in line with economists' expectations, according to Reuters. Stubbornly high rents accounted for much of the increase in inflation. However, there were pockets of relief for consumers. Food prices were unchanged for a second straight month. Grocery store prices fell 0.2 per cent after decreasing 0.3 per cent in March, posting back-to-back declines for the first time since July 2019. Fruits and vegetables, meat, fish and eggs were cheaper compared to March. Milk prices dropped 2 per cent. Natural gas prices tumbled 4.9 per cent and the cost of electricity dropped for the second straight month, blunting some of the 3 per cent jump in gasoline prices, which followed a 4.6 per cent plunge in March. The rebound came after Saudi Arabia and other OPEC+ oil producers announced further oil output cuts. Annual inflation increased 4.9 per cent, which was the smallest yearly rise since April 2021. - with Reuters"

The S & P 500 gained 18.47 points, or 0.4 per cent, at 4,137, while the Nasdaq Composite added 126.89 points, or 1 per cent, at 12,306. The Nasdaq was helped by a 4.1 per cent climb in Google's parent company Alphabet as the company rolled out more artificial intelligence for its core search product in response to competition from Microsoft Corp. Large-cap tech stocks including Apple Inc and Microsoft also gained 1.04 per cent and 1.73 per cent, respectively. The rate-sensitive S & P 500 technology sector index went up 1.2 per cent and the communication services rose 1.69 per cent. Markets reacted positively because they saw the inflation data as a small positive, with hopes rising of a rate pause. \"The CPI is indicating some sort of relief in inflationary pressure. That would mean the Fed would be toward the end or already at the end of its interest rate cycle, and growth companies are most heavily affected by higher interest rates,\" Kevin W. Philip, a partner at investment advisor Bel Air said. Fed funds futures traders are pricing in a pause in rate increases at the central bank's June meeting, and less than a 5 per cent chance of another 25 basis point hike. However, investors also had concerns about the looming US debt ceiling. Talks on raising the US federal government's $US31.4 trillion debt ceiling entered a new phase on Wednesday as some areas of potential compromise emerged after Tuesday's White House meeting. Regional bank shares extended declines from volatile sessions last week on concerns about the sector's health. PacWest Bancorp fell 0.5 per cent, and Zions Bancorporation fell 2.7 per cent respectively. Oil and gas producer Occidental Petroleum Corp fell 3.6 per cent after its first-quarter earnings fell short of analysts' estimates. Livent Corp rose 5.2 per cent after Australian lithium miner Allkem Ltd agreed to merge with the US-based chemical manufacturing firm to create a $US10.6 billion firm. Airbnb Inc 10.9 per cent as the vacation rental booking company had fewer bookings and lower average daily rates in the second quarter. Rivian Automotive jumped 1.8 per cent after the electrical vehicle maker beat estimates for its first-quarter results and reiterated its annual production forecast. - with Reuters",

The Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 0.4 per cent last month after gaining 0.1 per cent in March. The increase was in line with economists' expectations, according to Reuters. Stubbornly high rents accounted for much of the increase in inflation. However, there were pockets of relief for consumers. Food prices were unchanged for a second straight month. Grocery store prices fell 0.2 per cent after decreasing 0.3 per cent in March, posting back-to-back declines for the first time since July 2019. Fruits and vegetables, meat, fish and eggs were cheaper compared to March. Milk prices dropped 2 per cent. Natural gas prices tumbled 4.9 per cent and the cost of electricity dropped for the second straight month, blunting some of the 3 per cent jump in gasoline prices, which followed a 4.6 per cent plunge in March. The rebound came after Saudi Arabia and other OPEC+ oil producers announced further oil output cuts. Annual inflation increased 4.9 per cent, which was the smallest yearly rise since April 2021. - with Reuters",

              "plaintext": "Here's some detail about how the US markets ended up overnight: The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 30.48 points, or 0.09 per cent, to 33,531. The S & P 500 gained 18.47 points, or 0.4 per cent, at 4,137, while the Nasdaq Composite added 126.89 points, or 1 per cent, at 12,306. The Nasdaq was helped by a 4.1 per cent climb in Google's parent company Alphabet as the company rolled out more artificial intelligence for its core search product in response to competition from Microsoft Corp. Large-cap tech stocks including Apple Inc and Microsoft also gained 1.04 per cent and 1.73 per cent, respectively. The rate-sensitive S & P 500 technology sector index went up 1.2 per cent and the communication services rose 1.69 per cent. Markets reacted positively because they saw the inflation data as a small positive, with hopes rising of a rate pause. \"The CPI is indicating some sort of relief in inflationary pressure. That would mean the Fed would be toward the end or already at the end of its interest rate cycle, and growth companies are most heavily affected by higher interest rates,\" Kevin W. Philip, a partner at investment advisor Bel Air said. Fed funds futures traders are pricing in a pause in rate increases at the central bank's June meeting, and less than a 5 per cent chance of another 25 basis point hike. However, investors also had concerns about the looming US debt ceiling. Talks on raising the US federal government's $US31.4 trillion debt ceiling entered a new phase on Wednesday as some areas of potential compromise emerged after Tuesday's White House meeting. Regional bank shares extended declines from volatile sessions last week on concerns about the sector's health. PacWest Bancorp fell 0.5 per cent, and Zions Bancorporation fell 2.7 per cent respectively.

The Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 0.4 per cent last month after gaining 0.1 per cent in March. The increase was in line with economists' expectations, according to Reuters. Stubbornly high rents accounted for much of the increase in inflation. However, there were pockets of relief for consumers. Food prices were unchanged for a second straight month. Grocery store prices fell 0.2 per cent after decreasing 0.3 per cent in March, posting back-to-back declines for the first time since July 2019. Fruits and vegetables, meat, fish and eggs were cheaper compared to March. Milk prices dropped 2 per cent. Natural gas prices tumbled 4.9 per cent and the cost of electricity dropped for the second straight month, blunting some of the 3 per cent jump in gasoline prices, which followed a 4.6 per cent plunge in March. The rebound came after Saudi Arabia and other OPEC+ oil producers announced further oil output cuts. Annual inflation increased 4.9 per cent, which was the smallest yearly rise since April 2021. - with Reuters",
