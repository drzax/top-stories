It comes as Kim Jong Un and Vladimir Putin are expected to hold talks on the issue. Sanctions-hit Russia is reportedly eager to secure more military supplies from its ally to bolster its forces as Kyiv pushes a highly scrutinised counteroffensive to take back its territory. US President Joe Biden's national security advisor Jake Sullivan says Pyongyang and Moscow are eyeing \"leader-level discussions, perhaps even in person\" on Russia's arms needs. Sullivan says Russia could use weapons from North Korea to attack food supplies and heating infrastructure heading into winter to \"try to conquer territory that belongs to another sovereign nation\". \"This is not going to reflect well on North Korea and they will pay a price for this in the international community,\" he says. \"[It] says a lot that Russia is having to turn to a country like North Korea.\" \"We have continued to squeeze Russia's defence industrial base,\" he says, and Moscow is now \"looking to whatever source they can find\" for goods like ammunition .",

              "plaintext": "Reporting by North American correspondent Barbara Miller The former chairman of the far-right Proud Boys group Enrique Tarrio has been sentenced to 22 years' prison for his role in the events of January 6. Dressed in an orange jumpsuit, the 39 year-old was in court in Washington, DC to hear the sentence, the longest handed down so far in the criminal cases resulting from January 6. Tarrio addressed the court ahead of sentencing, describing what happened on January 6 as \"national embarrassment\" and apologised to members of Congress, the police officers who defended the Capitol and the citizens of Washington, DC. The defendant pleaded with the judge to show him mercy and broke down when talking of his family, saying he had failed them. The prosecution argued Tarrio organised street violence on a national scale, bringing together the group that entered the Capitol, instructing and leading them. In handing down the sentence Judge Timothy Kelly said what happened on January 6 damaged a precious American tradition of the peaceful transfer of power and it was going to take time to fix it.",

That's after a review of the state's energy transition recommended the government discuss delaying the closure because of concerns about as shortfall in electricity supply. NSW Premier Chris Minns has told ABC News Breakfast that it's too early to say the cost to taxpayers to keep the plant open for longer. \"This is a really narrow and tricky path to follow. I can't give you a quantum or amount that will be paid to Eraring because those commercial discussions have only just begun or will be about to begin.\" Former NSW Energy Minister Matt Kean has claimed it could cost up to $1 billion a year to keep Eraring open. But according to documents filed with the NSW Parliament, Origin Energy told the former NSW government in July 2021 that keeping the ageing plant partially open would cost taxpayers about $70 million a year. Origin said the plant was a \"bottomless pit\" and its preference was to close the plant by the middle of the decade. \"Eraring is loss-making now, and we expect that to worsen over the decade, even with careful cost management,\" Origin said in a presentation to the government in July 2021.

The decision is at the heart of a political storm with the government accused of protecting Qantas, with critics saying that allowing more international flights will reduce airfares. Senators voted 32 to 31 to establish an inquiry examining the impacts of the Qatar Airways decision, including the cost of flights. But Treasurer Jim Chalmers has told RN Breakfast that the government has no intention of reviewing the decision, and the \"decision was the right one, taken in the usual way.\" \"The aviation sector is expanding, international flights are expanding and what I'm trying to tell you is that different transport ministers, not just Minister King (Catherine King), Minister McCormack under the other government, from time to time decisions are taken not to proceed with these kind of outcomes between countries.\" \"It's not actually that unusual.\" Shadow transport minister Brigid McKenzie says the inquiry will examine why the decision was made. \"I think it's been clear over the last couple of weeks in particular that Australians have a lot of questions about why this government keeps making decisions that keep airfares high and cancellations and delays in the wrong direction.\" Meanwhile, it was a dramatic day yesterday with Qantas boss Alan Joyce stepping down early, replaced by Vanessa Hudson who has pledged to put customers first.

A rise in oil prices has seen US stocks fall overnight on the first trading day of a holiday shortened week. The Dow Jones index fell 0.6 per cent after oil prices increased to the highest since November as Saudi Arabia and Russia extended voluntary production cuts. Bond yields jumped with the yield on the 10 year US Treasury bond rising 0.06 per cent to 4.27 per cent as investors focus on the Federal Reserve's next move on interest rates. The Australian share market is expected to open lower this morning. The Australian dollar fell more than 1 per cent overnight to 63.58 US cents after the RBA kept official interest rates on hold for the third month in a row and as the greenback gained to the highest level since March. That's a ten month low, which was also driven by weaker Chinese economic figures which showed that China's services industry expanded at the slowest pace in eight months in August. And investors are awaiting the June quarter GDP figures which will be out at 11:30 AEST. They expected to show a further annual economic slow down as interest rate rises work their way through the economy. Economists are predicting the economy expanded by 0.3 per cent over the June quarter, and by 1.8 per cent over the year. Over the first few months of the year, the economy grew by 0.2 per cent and by 2.3 per cent on an annual basis. Join us for all today's markets news.",
