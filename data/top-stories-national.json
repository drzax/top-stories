That was reiterated by Shadow Treasurer Angus Taylor was on News Breakfast earlier this morning, who said the government can no longer blame global events like the war in Ukraine for inflation, and it was the government's fault it was still so high. Host Lisa Millar put that line of thinking to Assistant Treasurer Stephen Jones, who maintains that it would not add to inflation and make the current situation worse. Here's what he said in response: \"Look, you can just contrast what Angus Taylor is saying with the words of the Reserve Bank governor himself, who has said that the budget that the government  handed down three weeks ago was not inflationary. \"I think I prefer the Reserve Bank governor's opinion over Angus Taylor's opinion when it comes to inflation and  interest rates.

The consultancy firm has been under intense scrutiny after it was revealed the firm used confidential tax information to help clients dodge tax laws. Acting CEO Kristin Stubbins says the firm has heard the calls from its stakeholders to release the names of those responsible for the confidentiality breach, but insists that not all those who received emails were knowingly involved in the leaks. PwC has publicly named three former partners in addition to Peter John Collins, and has also provided a Senate committee looking into the matter with a list of 63 people who received emails containing confidential information. A Senate inquiry looking into the matter will resume hearings on Wednesday, but PwC will not appear before the committee over concerns that it could interfere with an ongoing AFP investigation. Meanwhile, if you're not up to speed on the PwC scandal, here's something I prepared earlier 👇",
