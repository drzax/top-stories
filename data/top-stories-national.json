Shane Phillips is one of the well-known elders from Redfern, having helped create a number of social welfare programs that have transformed the community's relationship with police and authorities. He fronted the event with two of his grandchildren and said the nation needed this change. \"I know why I'm voting yes because I see people in this community here, we were a community that were downtrodden and were actually imploding as a community for a long time from the scars of dispossession,\" he passionately told the crowd. \"But we empowered ourselves, we found the solution, it was within us, we rebuilt ourselves, we went through healing. \"That is all this Voice is about for us, we want that to happen so we can heal as a country, so we can empower ourselves, so, my granddaughter and our kids don't have to have this industry of closing the gap as something they inherit.\"",

The majority of polls suggest the referendum will not be successful. Noel Pearson, who is one of the architects of the Uluru Statement of the Heart, which put forward the Voice to Parliament, says that outcome would be disappointing. \"This is a moral choice for the country, not just a question of constitutional law,\" he told AM. \"The choice we have is not equivalent - Yes and No are not equivalent choices. \"Yes is of a different quality to No. No would be a travesty for the country.\" You can listen to the full interview on AM with Sabra Lane by taping the link below.",

Looking at the sectors, energy picked up 3%, followed by healthcare (+0.8%) and academic and educational services (+0.5%). There were modest gains for basic materials (+0.2%) and utilities (+0.2%). Consumer cyclicals saw a 0.1% rise, while industrials was flat. There were four sectors in the red: consumer non-cyclicals (-0.4%), real estate (-0.3%), technology (-0.2%) and financials (-0.1%). The best performers of the day were (unsurprisingly) mostly gold miners, buoyed by higher bullion prices: De Grey Mining +8.1% Silver Lake Resources +6.3% Evolution Mining +6.3% West African Resources +6% Karoon Energy +5.7% And the worst performers of the day: Weebit Nano -9% Magellan Financial -7.2% Pilbara Minerals -4.6% Qantas Airways -3.8% Sayona Mining -3.4%",
