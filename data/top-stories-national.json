Weaker iron ore prices are weighing on the big miners, and big banks are weaker ahead of this week's meeting by the US Federal Reserve. The Fed is expected to keep interest rates on hold. The ASX 200 index is down 0.4 per cent in afternoon trade. Explosives maker Orica (+1.5 per cent) is higher after it announced higher pollution reduction targets at its Sustainability Investor Day. These include: an increased target to reduce direct carbon emissions (Scope 1 & 2) by at least 45 per cent by 2030 from 2019 levels a new short term target to reduce direct emissions by 30 per cent by 2026 from 2019 levels a new ambition to reduce customer and supply chain emissions (Scope 3) by 25 per cent by 2035 from 2022 baseline levels. Orica also confirmed its profit predictions for the full year. Takeover target Newcrest Mining (+1.5 per cent) gained after the world's biggest gold miner Newmont Mining got the green light from the Foreign Investment Review Board to buy the local gold producer for $26.2 billion. More regulatory approvals are required including a vote by shareholders. Logistics company Qube (-1 per cent) fell after reporting the death of a worker following at incident at its forestry harvesting operations in South Australia.

The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry-Westpac Survey of Industrial Trends. Australia's longest running business survey, remained at low levels over the third quarter, just above 50 points, which is the break even mark. Westpac says manufacturers are facing the weakest demand (outside of the pandemic) in a decade, and declining profitability. The survey of firms found new orders were flat for a second quarter, and employment and overtime fell. In fact, new orders, which are a key sign of health for a business because they indicate current demand, are the weakest for the half year since 2013. \"The key message and the number one concern of manufacturers is the lack of any growth in new orders.\" \"Back-to-back flat new orders (with only a net 1 per cent reporting a rise for both June and September quarters) is consistent with the marked slowing of the Australian economy.\" \"The economic downturn is centred on consumer spending, which was flat in the June quarter, as household real disposable income contracted for a fifth consecutive quarter, squeezed by rising living costs, higher interest rates, and additional tax obligations.\" The survey found the general business mood remains deeply pessimistic. More than one third of respondents expect the general business situation to worsen over the next six months, little changed from the previous quarter. So looks like AMP's Diana Mousina could be right when she says 50:50 chance of a recession. On the upside, Westpac says production rose modestly helped by an easing of worker and material shortages. And it thinks the survey suggests that the RBA is on hold from here. \"Inflation pressures have eased the survey finds, which along with the soft demand backdrop, adds to the case for the RBA remaining on hold and suggest that official interest rates have likely peaked.\"",

The RBA minutes released earlier today show that the board considered lifting the official cash rate by 0.25 per cent this month, but decided to keep rates on hold for the third month in a row. AMP deputy chief economist Diana Mousina thinks the RBA is done with rate hikes and may even reduce borrowing costs next year. \"We think that there is a chance of rate cuts, because of that view that we think the economy will be quite slow and soft and growth will be disappointing next year,\" she said. \"So that's what we think the Reserve Bank will be cutting interest rates, probably to start in the March quarter of 2024 .\" Ms Mousina also sees a 50:50 chance of a recession next year as unemployment rises above 4 per cent. That's as interest rate rises work their way through the economy and migration increases meaning more people are competing for jobs. I spoke to Diana Mousina last week on ABC News Channel after the unemployment rate remained steady at 3.7 per cent in August.",

There is also $300 million for housing, including plans for more than 1,400 affordable dwellings by the financial year 2039-40. Another $5 million has been allocated toward a 12-month consultation process for a \"pathway to Treaty\" with First Nations peoples. More from Isobel: This budget focuses spending on schools, hospitals and public sector wages — almost all of which had already been announced before today's budget. It includes: •\t$13.8 billion into health facilities, including new money for Fairfield Hospital Redevelopment and $400 million for the new Rouse Hill Hospital, on top of $300 million committed by the previous Coalition government. •\t$9.8 billion for schools and educational facilities •\t$72.3 billion into transport projects, including the Sydney Metro West and the Sydney Metro — Western Sydney Airport connection •\t$3.2 billion for disaster relief and recovery programs •\t$2.2 billion for a Housing and Infrastructure Plan A previously announced review into the viability and cost of the Sydney Metro is due to be given to government by the end of the year, the budget documents said. As part of the Housing and Infrastructure Plan, there is $300 million for publicly owned company Landcom housing to deliver \"an additional 1,409 affordable homes and 3,288 market homes to 2039-40.\" The budget papers show in addition to another affordable housing program, the state will build about 9,300 new social, affordable and private homes in the next 16 years. But Mr Mookhey expected 3000 of those to be built by the end of the decade. Mr Mookhey blamed the previous government for contributing to the housing crisis. \"If we had built more homes in the last decade we would have more homes in this decade,\" he said. Some smaller expenses are also notable. There is $5 million towards a 12-month consultation towards a \"pathway to Treaty\" with First Nations Australians.",
