It will help kids participate in sports and creative programs. -\tThere will be free general admission to the Australian Museum and Museums of History. This will cost the government $28.3 million over four years. -\tEligible seniors, pensions and veterans will receive discounted or concessional National Park passes -\tPaid ticketing for foreshore viewing spots at the Sydney New Year's Eve fireworks will end which means everyone can attend for free. This will cost the government around $3 million each year. -\tFrea parking at all rural and regional public hospitals began from August 1. This costs the government $19 million over four years.",

There is also $300 million for housing, including plans for more than 1,400 affordable dwellings by the financial year 2039-40. Another $5 million has been allocated toward a 12-month consultation process for a \"pathway to Treaty\" with First Nations peoples. More from Isobel: This budget focuses spending on schools, hospitals and public sector wages — almost all of which had already been announced before today's budget. It includes: •\t$13.8 billion into health facilities, including new money for Fairfield Hospital Redevelopment and $400 million for the new Rouse Hill Hospital, on top of $300 million committed by the previous Coalition government. •\t$9.8 billion for schools and educational facilities •\t$72.3 billion into transport projects, including the Sydney Metro West and the Sydney Metro — Western Sydney Airport connection •\t$3.2 billion for disaster relief and recovery programs •\t$2.2 billion for a Housing and Infrastructure Plan A previously announced review into the viability and cost of the Sydney Metro is due to be given to government by the end of the year, the budget documents said. As part of the Housing and Infrastructure Plan, there is $300 million for publicly owned company Landcom housing to deliver \"an additional 1,409 affordable homes and 3,288 market homes to 2039-40.\" The budget papers show in addition to another affordable housing program, the state will build about 9,300 new social, affordable and private homes in the next 16 years. But Mr Mookhey expected 3000 of those to be built by the end of the decade. Mr Mookhey blamed the previous government for contributing to the housing crisis. \"If we had built more homes in the last decade we would have more homes in this decade,\" he said. Some smaller expenses are also notable. There is $5 million towards a 12-month consultation towards a \"pathway to Treaty\" with First Nations Australians.",

The RBA minutes released earlier today show that the board considered lifting the official cash rate by 0.25 per cent this month, but decided to keep rates on hold for the third month in a row. AMP deputy chief economist Diana Mousina thinks the RBA is done with rate hikes and may even reduce borrowing costs next year. \"We think that there is a chance of rate cuts, because of that view that we think the economy will be quite slow and soft and growth will be disappointing next year,\" she said. \"So that's what we think the Reserve Bank will be cutting interest rates, probably to start in the March quarter of 2024 .\" Ms Mousina also sees a 50:50 chance of a recession next year as unemployment rises above 4 per cent. That's as interest rate rises work their way through the economy and migration increases meaning more people are competing for jobs. I spoke to Diana Mousina last week on ABC News Channel after the unemployment rate remained steady at 3.7 per cent in August.",

Fortescue Metals (-1.1 per cent) and BHP (-1 per cent) are taking a hit. Wall Street traded sideways as investors await this week's decision by the Federal Reserve, where it is expected to keep official interest rates on hold at 5 to 5.25 per cent. Banks are also weighing with ANZ (-1.2 per cent) and the National Australia Bank (-1.1 per cent) doing the worst. Coal miner New Hope (-3.7 per cent) has gained after a rise in annual profit thanks to record demand coal and higher prices. Gold miners are doing the best with Ramelius Resources (+5 per cent) and Silver Lake Resources (4.3 per cent) making gains on the ASX 200. Doing the worst are semi conductor technology firm Weebit Nano (-7.1 per cent) and Afterpay owner Block (-4.5 per cent). That's after Alyssa Henry, the chief executive of Block's payment provider service, Square, is set to leave the business after more than nine years.",

The miner made a net profit of almost $1.1 billion for the 2023 financial year, up nearly 11 per cent from 2022. New Hope chief executive Rob Bishop says strong demand and global supply constraints pushed thermal coal prices to record levels in the first half of the year. “Exceptional performance across the business throughout FY23 enabled our team to capitalise on the market conditions, finishing the year with $730.7 million cash at bank, no debt following the convertible note repurchase and a net asset position of $2,525.3 million,” Mr Bishop said. Global coal consumption is at a record high thanks to strong growth in Asia outpacing falling demand in the US and Europe according to the International Energy Agency. Demand from the two largest coal users, China and India, offset demand falls in developed countries in 2022. New Hope sold coal for an average of $346.73 during the year, up from $281.84 in 2022. Investors get a final dividend of 21 cents a share, but that's down from the 31 cents a share they got in 2022. They also get a special dividend of 9 cents a share, but that is also down from the 25 cents a share they got last year. Mr Bishop says New Hope's results this year are \"outstanding' so how come the dividends are lower? with Reuters",
