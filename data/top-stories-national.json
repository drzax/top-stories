I just think potentially the system contributed to allowing mistruths to be the narrative.” She said she believes the No result has pushed reconciliation back years. \"For our people there is going to be more distrust, not just in government, I think we will be reading rooms and counting and thinking who were our allies,\" she said. “We saw so many businesses, many corporations come out in support of the Yes campaign, and in the future we will hold those organsations accountable and they will have to walk the walk in spite of that outcome.” But Ms Beveridge said she still remains hopeful moving forward. “We came from a place of love, we were never about division, this was never about race, we will just keep digging deep and hope for a better tomorrow,\" she said. “There will be a continuation of our strength and our resilience and our hope for a better tomorrow.”",

Northern Tasmanians strongly voted No and out at the Evandale Sunday Markets, south of Launceston, many spoke to the ABC about what happened. Richard Baker said he saw an ad on TV that said: \"If you don't know, vote No.\" \"I didn't know, I voted No,\" he said. \"If they wanted to win, they needed tell us what they were going to do and they would have got more Yes votes.\" He said he didn't think people understood what it was all about. Yes voter Max Nicholas was at the Evandale Market today and said he was \"pretty disappointed\". \"I expected the No vote to get up but I would have liked it to go our way,\" he said. \"I've got a pretty cynical view on people. If it's not for them personally, they don't want anything to do with it, and a lot of them don't like seeing others get something. Plus, there was a lot of misinformation and scaremongering out there.\" He said he didn't think the Yes campaign did a good enough job in educating people about what they were voting for. Launceston man Jim McCauley said he was \"feeling a bit sad\" that the referendum failed. \"An Aboriginal bloke was saying to us that, 'We've always passed down our information by telling stories and listening,' and I felt that's pretty much what the Voice is about.\" He said he felt the referendum failed because it became politicised — \"we're good and they're bad\" — and the issue got \"torn\" with no clear message. Yes voter Veronica Stone said she wasn't surprised by the referendum result. \"It was no chance [of being successful],\" she said. She hit back at the No campaign's slogan saying \"If you don't know, vote No\". She felt there was a lot of \"fearmongering\" in the campaign, \"and it made people not want to do the research\". Barbara said it would have been better to use the money \"wasted\" on the referendum in areas where it was needed instead, such as the health system or schools. \"We're all the same and there's no need for them to try and make a difference between us,\" she said. She said she was glad though that there had finally been a decision. \"It wouldn't worry me either way if it had gone through,\" she said.",
