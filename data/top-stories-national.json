He was campaigning in Sydney’s inner-west at the Addi Road Food Bank with 2023 Local Hero of the Year and founder of Turbans 4 Australia, Amar Singh. \"We're working very hard to overcome the misinformation that the no campaign is throwing at all communities in the country, not the least the multicultural community,” Mr Pearson said. “We've done a heap of events with people in western Sydney here with English as a second language communities.\" During the event he briefly broke into song, using lyrics he says were written by “Aunty Dora” in his home community. \"What of the first peoples unrecognised and unseen voices of wisdom silenced from the start, erased from history?\" he sang, to the gathered group. Mr Pearson called on “the Italian,” “the Greeks,” “the Eastern Europeans,” and the “western Europeans,” who “built this country” and “built great lives here for your families”. “Extend the hand of opportunity to the original peoples of this country.” Mr Singh has travelled around the country promoting the Voice to Parliament to diverse communities because he believes it'll make \"a better, more diverse Australia\".",

Rinehart's company Hancock Prospecting let the ASX know yesterday evening that it has recently increased its stake in Liontown to 14.67%, from 12.36%. It will give Hancock a greater say over Liontown's direction as it awaits a takeover offer from Ablemarle, the world's biggest lithium producer. And when you look back through the company filings, you'll find Ms Rinehart has been increasing her stake in Liontown quite quickly. Less than four weeks ago, the Hancock group owned 7.72% voting power, but that was increased to 10.69% two weeks later, then to 12.36%, and now to 14.67%. Liontown shares have risen 0.5% today to $2.97 per share, up around 120% this year. The graph below shows how its share price has performed over the last six months:",

The RBNZ decision leaves the cash rate at its 15-year high for a third straight meeting. \"Interest rates are constraining economic activity and reducing inflationary pressure as required,\" the central bank said in a statement. The RBNZ said the monetary committee agreed that interest rates will need to remain at a restrictive level for the foreseeable future to ensure consumer price inflation returns to its 1% to 3% target range. \"With monetary conditions remaining restrictive, spending growth is expected to decline further,\" the bank said. However, like the RBA, it cautioned of potential future increases to rates should inflation not slow as much as required.",
