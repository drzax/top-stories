We don't know what's happening from minute to minute, the fire is moving very fast.” He said their \"number one concern\" is the safety of residents. “The message is if you can get out, get out while you can because we don't want to lose lives.” An evacuation centre at Stanthorpe is ready to take any evacuees.",

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office played down the report compiled by the Intelligence Ministry as a hypothetical exercise — a \"concept paper\". The document is dated October 13 and was first published by Sicha Mekomit, a local news site. In its report, the Intelligence Ministry — a junior ministry that conducts research but does not set policy — offered three alternatives \"to effect a significant change in the civilian reality in the Gaza Strip in light of the Hamas crimes that led to the Sword of Iron war\". The document's authors deem this alternative to be the most desirable for Israel's security. The document proposes moving Gaza's civilian population to tent cities in northern Sinai, then building permanent cities and an undefined humanitarian corridor. A security zone would be established inside Israel to block the displaced Palestinians from entering. The report did not say what would become of Gaza once its population is cleared out. AP",
