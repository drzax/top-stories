The bank, which had pencilled in a 4.1% rate peak in February then backed away from that, eventually settling on a 3.6% RBA cash rate peak, before last month's surprise rate hike blew that out of the water. NAB has now swung back to its February forecast, and expects the Reserve Bank to push through at least one more rate rise. It has also blamed the RBA and its flip-flopping on communication for its frequently changing rate forecasts. \"The key uncertainty for our rate expectations has been the reaction function of the RBA, and monetary policy strategy of the RBA been marked by some mixed signals in 2023. \"However, it is clear that the near-term balance of risks on inflation remain to the upside, and the RBA is forecasting inflation to only return to the top of the target band by mid-2025. \"At least one additional rate rise is likely to be necessary to limit the risk this timeline slips any further. We wouldn't rule out the prospect of an additional rise to 4.35% if the data stays stronger for longer. \"Importantly, our rate call is not a response to the recent Federal Budget, which we judge to be broadly neutral in terms of its effects on inflation and implications for monetary policy.\" For those already struggling with rapid rate rises on large mortgages, NAB offers a glimmer of hope. \"It remains our view that, as higher rates pass through to household cash flows and the wider economy, the economy will begin to slow more noticeably in the second half of 2023 and into 2024, seeing annual GDP growth slow to below 1% and the unemployment rate begin to rise, reaching around 4.7% in 2024. \"This makes it an increasingly difficult balancing act for the RBA to manage inflation lower without slowing the economy too much. We continue to expect the cash rate to return to a more neutral setting of 3.1% by mid-2024 as this slowdown takes hold.\" So, NAB expects rates will come back down, but only after a few hundred thousand people lose their jobs. If you're not one of those people, that will be good news for keeping up with your mortgage. If you are …",

While the ASX 200 is off 0.2% at 7,244 points and the All Ords down a similar amount at 7,439, much of the decline is down to ANZ and Macquarie. Both banks are ex-dividend today, which means anyone who buys their shares from today on won't get their most recent shareholder distributions. That's an 81-cent half-year dividend for ANZ and a $4.50 per share payment for Macquarie shareholders. That's the main reason ANZ's shares are down $1.06, or 4.3%, to $23.44, while Macquarie's are off 3%, or $5.33, to $173.75. The banking sector as a whole is a little on the nose, amid ongoing concerns about the crisis for many US regional banks, as well as more general worries about credit quality and earnings for banks with interest rates higher than they've been for more than a decade. The financial sector on the ASX 200 was down 1.2 per cent in the first 25 minutes of trade, with industrials, education and technology also stuck well in the red. On the flip side, mining and energy are having good mornings, with basic materials up 0.9 per cent.",

In the absence of a superior proposal emerging, Newcrest's board has unanimously supported the offer that will see its shareholders receive 0.4 Newmont shares for each Newcrest share they own. Newcrest can also pay its shareholder a special franked dividend of up to $US1.10 a share prior to completion of the deal. The Australian company says the deal values Newcrest at $29.27 per share, a 30.4% premium to prior to Newmont's initial offer being made. The deal values Newcrest at an enterprise value of $28.8 billion, leaving its shareholders with a 31 per cent stake in the combined company. Newcrest says it will leave the merged company as a \"clear global leader in gold production\" with a significant and growing presence in copper. Aside from needing support from Newcrest shareholders, the deal will also need regulatory approvals from the Foreign Investment Review Board and other regulators in several countries.",
