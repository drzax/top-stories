The government's latest Intergenerational Report, which projects outlooks for the economy and the budget over the next 40 years, will be released in full tomorrow by Mr Chalmers. The report shows the reliance on the age pension will reduce, because of growing superannuation balances. Mr Chalmers says it shows that super is achieving its purpose of providing retirement support. \"Spending on the pension, age pension and service pension will go down from about 2.3 percent of the economy last year to 2 percent at end of IGR period. that is an absolutely stunning outcome when you consider the aging of our population.\" It's important to note though that tax breaks associated with superannuation will exceed pension spending by the 2040s and reach 2.4 per cent of GDP by 2063.
