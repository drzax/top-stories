Before we get to the big news of the day, let's start overseas where it was a pretty positive session. All three of the Wall Street indices finished higher — the Dow was up 0.3%, the S & P500 picked up 0.2%, and the Nasdaq also gained 0.2% by the end of the session. Although the US markets were stronger, there wasn't a whole lot of news around to thank for it as it rounded out the end of another month. That said, the S & P500 ended July higher, up 3.1%, making it the fifth consecutive positive month for the index. US markets are tentatively edging forward as they wait for corporate giants Amazon and Apple to report their earnings later in the week, as reporting season rolls on. On the commodities front, it was a solid night for oil, which hit a three-month high overnight with a spot price of $US81.85. The reason for that? Expectations of tighter global supply in the coming months, which will result in stronger demand. Back home and we're in for a positive start according to futures trading, and it's all going to play into a bumper news day. Not only do we have housing finance and building approvals data coming from the ABS at 11:30, CoreLogic has released its latest house price data, and of course it's rates day with the RBA board meeting this morning before announcing its decision this afternoon. As for what will happen come 2:30pm AEST? It's currently an even bet between another 0.25 percentage point hike, or another month of holding steady at 4.1%. All in all, it's going to be a big day — let's make like the Matildas last night and get stuck into it.",
