You bet. Voyager are a Perth-based synth-metal — or progressive metal — group, putting just as much emphasis on melody as the heavy elements of their music. Crucially for Australia's chances, they are epic live performers - and you only wish you could bottle the energy they have brought to their semi-final and the all-important jury final this time yesterday. The song and their performance saw them roar through their semi-final earlier this week thanks to strong public support. Now they have to convince Europe to vote for them again. LYRICS: I'm here tonight Promise mе you'll hold me 'til I die I'm by your side Promisе me it's gonna Promise me it's gonna be alright Watch out for the epic breakdown halfway through, the general showmanship of the entire crew led by frontman Danny Estrin, and the big finish which should have the Liverpool Arena absolutely jumping.",
