The artist, whose legal name is Willie Maxwell, apologised for his actions and told a court he was \"exactly where I'm supposed to be\" before the sentencing. The Trap Queen rapper pleaded guilty in August 2022 to a conspiracy drug charge that carried a mandatory minimum sentence of five years. Maxwell told US District Judge Joanna Seybert, \"Me being selfish in my pride put me in this position today.\" His lawyers had suggested he turned to selling drugs because of financial hardship brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic. Maxwell was arrested in October 2021 on charges of participating in a conspiracy to smuggle large amounts of heroin, fentanyl and other drugs into the New York City area.",
