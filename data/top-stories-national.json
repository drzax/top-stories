It has been heading south and is now ever so close to $US100 a tonne. Take a look at this chart compiled by economists at CBA that shows the price movement since August 2020. The spot price for the commodity peaked in about May 2021 about $US240 a tonne. The price plunge links back to demand from China. Spot prices are down about 11 per cent since July 25. CBA's Mining and Energy Commodities expert, Vivek Dhar writes: \"Markets are concerned that policymakers may not follow through with any meaningful support for China's commodity-intensive economy following the semi-annual economic conference attended by China's top leaders (Politburo). \"The conference, which took place in late July, saw China's top leaders pledge to \"strength counter cyclical policies\", where an \"adjustment\" would be made to the restrictions on the property sector. \"Policymakers even reportedly talked of bringing forward infrastructure spending to help support the economy. These announcements though lacked details such as targets and timelines .\" China's property sector accounts for 35-40% of China's steel consumption. Most of China's property sector indicators have worsened through the first half of 2023. \"It's challenging to see how policymakers turn-around China's property sector, particularly given the extent of supply and demand side issues that are weighing on the sector at present. \"A number of factors began last year when China's COVID-zero policy crippled household balance sheets and saw a number of property developers default. \"We think steel demand from China's property sector will likely only stabilise next year. \"The rapid fall in iron ore prices over the last week raises downside risks to our forecast for iron ore prices to fall to $US100/t by Q4 2023. \" Iron ore miners like BHP, Rio Tinto and FMG will often say they're playing the long game and don't watch spot prices, but I'm pretty sure they'll be keeping a close eye on this activity in China. It's also worth pointing out, $US100 it still much higher than the government's long term price estimates of $US55 a tonne .",
