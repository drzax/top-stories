On arrival, the 47-year-old woman allegedly threatened police with the axe before barricading herself inside a unit. Specialist tactical officers, including negotiators, arrived before police gaining entry at about 9:45pm. Police used a taser along with a number of \"tactical options\" to take the woman into custody. She was then escorted from the scene to an ambulance, however, her condition deteriorated a short time later, and she was taken to John Hunter Hospital, where she later died.

Similarly, in North America, the average ticket price to one of top 100 tours grew from around US$90 ($140) to US$111 ($172) in 2022. In June, Reuters reported that the inflation for a live performance ticket in the US was 2.6 per cent higher than the country's inflation rate.

And it looks like the ASX will follow, with futures up more than 1 per cent. In the US, retail sales rose more than expected in August on higher gasoline prices, while initial claims for state unemployment benefits climbed to a seasonally adjusted 220,000 for the week ended September 9 from 217,000 the week before. Monthly producer prices for final demand rose 0.7 per cent last month, against expectations of a 0.4 per cent increase. On an annual basis, they increased 1.6 per cent compared with estimates of a 1.2 per cent rise. \"Today's economic data confirms the path toward a soft landing, but without being so hot that the Fed thinks they might need to do a couple more rate hikes,\" said Ross Mayfield, Investment Strategy Analyst at Baird. \"All together, it's pretty bullish.\" European stocks jumped to their biggest one-day percentage gain in six months, after the European Central Bank - hiking interest rates for the tenth straight time - suggested it was at the end of its monetary policy tightening cycle. The pan-European STOXX 600 rose 1.5 per cent and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.8 per cent. Oil prices surged to their highest since November as a tighter supply outlook offset demand concerns. Gold prices rebounded after an initial dip in opposition to the strengthening greenback.",
