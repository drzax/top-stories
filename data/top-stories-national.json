Todd Murphy chops on to give him his fifth in his first Test since December, just wreaking havoc with legitimate pace but also, pivotally, accuracy, control and swing. He got Usman Khawaja with the ball of the innings, then mopped up at the end with Carey, Starc, Cummins and Murphy all falling victim to his wily ways. Wood finished with 5-34 from 11.4 overs. On the other side, almost everyone struggled against a properly impressive bowling effort, where all the seamers were on song and found movement off the pitch and through the air. It was only the recalled Mitch Marsh who shone, with his 118 off 118 containing some of the most powerful striking we've seen in, well, about four days, since Ben Stokes rocked Lord's. But I think this was even better from a pure striking perspective. That knock saved Australia from total disaster, but it's not a big total because Travis Head was the only other Aussie who got more than 22. So the Australian bowlers still have to follow that up with a brilliant start against the English top order.",
