Q : A group of Neo-Nazis congregated in Melbourne on the weekend for an anti-immigration rally at the same time as your Opposition was prosecuting an argument with concerns about migration. So, what do you say to those in migrant communities who point to the rhetoric of the Opposition as emboldening fascism and also making them feel more fearful of being attacked in Australia's streets? Angus Taylor: Neo-Nazism, I can't reject it strongly enough, and I think Peter Dutton has been very clear about that. And any association of our agenda with that, I think, is just wrong. And, uh, I won't be drawn on it because it's rot. I mean, of course, of course not. Look, we want the right thing for all Australians. Q : I guess the question is, did he take into consideration, as you were formulating your response to the Budget, that there could be unintended consequences of focusing on migration? Angus Taylor: We don't take responsibility for the behaviour of nutters in Melbourne. I mean, if they're gonna go and do that sort of stuff, we can't take responsibility for their heinous behaviour and we certainly don't condone it. But we will argue the case for what's right for Australia every day of the week, and, of course, that's what we're doing here.",

Angus Taylor: Pat, what we ultimately want is what I think all Australians want, which is higher real wages for all Australians. That's why I was talking about productivity, because that's one of the ways you can achieve it. If you can make it easier for someone to do their job, then the employer can pay them all.

Put simply, it's a measure of how workers' base pay is changing, and excludes the effect of boosts like bonuses, overtime, hours worked, promotions or shifting jobs/employers. It's the change in how much people are getting paid per hour for doing the same job for the same employer, and thus pretty much akin to the inflation rate for wages. It's important for the RBA for two reasons. The first is that higher pay rises mean households have more money to spend, which means more demand and that generally keeps consumer price inflation higher — businesses have no reason to cut prices if people are still buying their goods or services. The second is that wages are a large input cost for most businesses, the largest for many. This is especially so in the services sector, where the most recent inflation figures showed an acceleration in price rises. If wages rise too fast, the RBA is concerned businesses will pass through those increased costs, sending inflation higher still. The good news (or bad news if you desperately need a pay rise to keep up with your mortgage/rent/grocery bills) is that there's been few signs of wages across the board rising particularly fast. The economist forecasts for today's WPI centre on pay rises of 0.9% over the March quarter and 3.6% over the past year, up from 0.8% and 3.3% in the December quarter reading. Given that consumer price inflation was 7% over the March quarter, workers are still expected to be taking a big real pay cut, but at least they're not contributing much to inflation in Australia.",
