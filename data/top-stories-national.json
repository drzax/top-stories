She'll be appearing before Professor Fels later today. Ms Jaeger has seen all her bills increase this year, including a 40 per cent increase on her home insurance, despite not making a claim. \" There's been no reason or justification around the bill hike which for me has been really distressing,\" she told my colleague Emily Stewart. \"I've noticed a significant cost of living increasing over the last 12 months. \"What's been really alarming for me across the board is that it's affected in terms of bills or whether it's utility costs, phone services, internet - my usage has not increased, it's actually decreased because it's something that I'm particularly honing in on to reduce any costs and to be as savvy as possible.\" While Ms Jaeger already works full time as a nurse, she is now looking at getting a second job to make ends meet. \"It's really overwhelming and a really difficult position to be in because I never thought I'd be considering whether I pay for a family member's medication or whether we can go to the doctor.\" Emily will be wrapping up today's proceedings in the inquiry for ABC News tonight as well as The Business - so tune in for that coverage this evening or on iView .",
