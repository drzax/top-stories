                  "articleBody": "The big news globally overnight was the Fed's latest move to raise interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point to between 5-5.25%. The move was widely expected, and the rate hike was softened with the Fed now adopting a meeting-by-meeting approach to rates decisions, rather than leaning towards rate hikes. US Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell's press conference saw bond yields decline, despite the rate rise, but that wasn't enough to boost markets, with the S & P 500 index down 0.7%, the Dow Jones off 0.8% and the Nasdaq falling 0.5%. Here's the summary of what Mr Powell had to say from NAB's Taylor Nugent. \"Powell said that dropping the expectation of further tightening in the statement was 'a meaningful change' but that decisions would be made meeting by meeting and \"a decision on a pause was not made today. \" \"Powell said 'policy is tight' and relative to a sufficiently restrictive level he said \"we feel like we're getting closer and maybe even there\" but that it is an ongoing assessment. Ahead of the next meeting we'll get two more employment and CPI reports. \"Powell pushed back on market pricing for cuts, but only by noting that the FOMC views inflation as coming down 'not so quickly'. On those inflation forecasts rate cuts would not be so forthcoming according to Powell, but the push back was conditional on that expectation for stubborn inflation. \"Powell expects the US to avoid a recession, in contrast to the March Staff forecasts.\""

The move was widely expected, and the rate hike was softened with the Fed now adopting a meeting-by-meeting approach to rates decisions, rather than leaning towards rate hikes. US Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell's press conference saw bond yields decline, despite the rate rise, but that wasn't enough to boost markets, with the S & P 500 index down 0.7%, the Dow Jones off 0.8% and the Nasdaq falling 0.5%. Here's the summary of what Mr Powell had to say from NAB's Taylor Nugent. \"Powell said that dropping the expectation of further tightening in the statement was 'a meaningful change' but that decisions would be made meeting by meeting and \"a decision on a pause was not made today. \" \"Powell said 'policy is tight' and relative to a sufficiently restrictive level he said \"we feel like we're getting closer and maybe even there\" but that it is an ongoing assessment. Ahead of the next meeting we'll get two more employment and CPI reports. \"Powell pushed back on market pricing for cuts, but only by noting that the FOMC views inflation as coming down 'not so quickly'. On those inflation forecasts rate cuts would not be so forthcoming according to Powell, but the push back was conditional on that expectation for stubborn inflation. \"Powell expects the US to avoid a recession, in contrast to the March Staff forecasts.\"",
