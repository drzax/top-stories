The subject was brought up during a working dinner late on Tuesday, host Japan said in a statement, with the group due to continue talks on Wednesday. The statement gave no details of options being discussed if the Hamas militant group is ousted from Gaza. Diplomats in Washington, the United Nations, the Middle East and beyond have also started weighing the options. Discussions include the deployment of a multinational force to post-conflict Gaza, an interim Palestinian-led administration that would exclude Hamas politicians, a stopgap security and governance role for neighbouring Arab states and temporary UN supervision of the territory, Reuters reported. G7 foreign ministers are due to issue a statement mentioning the Israel-Gaza crisis later today, marking only the second such joint statement from the group on the issue since October 7. The statement will present the G7's \"united stance\" on the Middle East situation, Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirokazu Matsuno said. It is expected to include a call for humanitarian pauses, temporary breaks in fighting to allow aid into the besieged enclave, Japanese media reported on Wednesday. The G7 is made up of Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States, with the European Union also participating in the talks.",

The IDF has published vision and a folder of photos appearing to show troops and bulldozers near Al Noor amusement park south of Gaza City. On Telegram, it said it located an underground tunnel running adjacent to the theme park and destroyed it. The folder of images also included a photo appearing to show soldiers and tanks in the vicinity of a different ferris wheel about 9 kilometres away. Map data analysed by the ABC indicates this ferris wheel is located near the Al Hilal (The Crescent) Sports Club, near the coast north of Gaza City. The IDF did not comment on what its soldiers were doing in this area in its Telegram post. In its update, it also said it had destroyed an \"underground tunnel shaft and a weapons warehouse\" containing chemicals and mines, found near a university, but the ABC could not identify the location from the provided vision. Earlier today the IDF said it was moving into the \"heart of Gaza city\". Both ferris wheels are located about 5km away from the city centre. The ABC could not independently verify when the IDF's photos were taken.",
