The Bureau of Statistics says the total value of residential dwellings in Australia rose by $325 billion to $10.09 trillion over the June quarter. That's near the record high seen in March 2022, just before the Reserve Bank started raising interest rates from record lows in May 2022. The mean (middle) price of properties rose by $25,200 to $912,000 over the June quarter. The number of homes in Australia increased by 52,200 to 11.05 million. Housing in New South Wales is the most expensive, while the cheapest housing is in the Northern Territory. Mean prices: NSW: $1,167,500 ACT: $947,900 Victoria: $904,800 Queensland: $781,600 South Australia: $684,700 Western Australia: $671,000 Tasmania: $662,200 Northern Territory: $512,700. A shortage of properties and more migration keeps pushing up prices despite 12 interest rate rises since May last year. Here's more from my colleague Kate Ainsworth.",
