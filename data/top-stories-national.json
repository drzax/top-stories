She says as the full effects of the RBA's interest rate rises flow through the economy, coupled with increased migration, the jobless rate will tick up in the coming months. \"We think the unemployment rate in a year's time will be over 4.5%, if we get a significant downturn then it could be at 5%, if not even a little bit higher, but our base case is for 4.5% from here,\" she said. \"If you put that into context, that is still quite a favourable outcome for Australia, because before the pandemic, it was difficult for the unemployment rate to get under 5.5%, so the fact that we do have this unemployment rate that's likely to still remain at very low levels compared to history, I think should still be considered a good outcome. \"But the unemployment rate will rise, which is a natural impact of rising interest rates, so unfortunately, that means that more people will be out of work. \"That will be a hit to household incomes, which is why we are generally semi-concerned about the outlook for the economy, we think economic growth is going to slow in the next 12 months .\"",

The All Ordinaries and ASX 200 are also up about +0.3 % (at 12.00pm AEST). BDO Economics Partner Anders Magnusson says a low unemployment rate usually indicates that things are good for households. \"However, this is currently accompanied by high multiple job holdings and increasing hours worked per employee, which suggests otherwise. With costs rising more quickly than wages, Australians are working more jobs and longer hours to make ends meet.\" It all means there is unlikely to be further interest rate hikes from the Reserve Bank next month. Mr Magnusson says he expects inflation to continue decreasing. \"Simultaneously low unemployment should be viewed by the RBA as a good thing rather than an inflation risk. Especially as wages have continued to grow by less than inflation over the last year.\"",
