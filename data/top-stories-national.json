This week the US's popular 30-year fixed mortgage rate hit the highest level since April 2002, with the average shooting up to 7.09%, according to mortgage finance agency Freddie Mac. That's up from 6.96% last week, and is nearly a full 2 percentage point higher than where it was this time last year. The average 15-year rate also surged to 6.46%, up from 6.34% the previous week — and is also the highest level since April 2002. The jump in mortgage rates comes as the yield on the 10-year Treasury note yield, which acts as a benchmark for mortgage rates, hit their highest level in 10 months — supported by concerns that strong domestic demand in the US could give the Federal Reserve a reason to lift rates again. \"The last time the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage exceeded seven percent was last November, \" said Freddie Mac's chief economist Sam Khater. \"Demand has been impacted by affordability headwinds, but low inventory remains the root cause of stalling home sales.\"",
