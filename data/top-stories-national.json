Thanks for your question Benjamin ! Craig has jumped on this one: Yes you can send your lids off to Lids 4 Kids. But in terms of the household recycling system, we have been told that leaving the lids on the bottles is more likely to see them recycled. One of the reasons that lids can be complex is that they are often made of a different plastic to the rest of the bottle. So if the bottle is going to a plant that is recycling PET plastics (like our soda bottles) they may not also be recycling HDPE or PP plastics which the lids are made of. However, different plastics can be separated in the process, so they can extract those different plastics can be removed and sent to a plant that does recycle them. Can’t guarantee every lid gets recycled, but it can happen. If you recycle your lids separately on their own they are likely to fall through the cracks at the material recovery factory ( you can see our tour of one in ep 1 tonight ).",

So if the bottle is going to a plant that is recycling PET plastics (like our soda bottles) they may not also be recycling HDPE or PP plastics which the lids are made of."

              "plaintext": "While China has announced a number of stimulus measures to boost its slowing economy, investors are looking for a bigger sugar hit. Yesterday China's top decision making body, the Politburo, said it would \"step up economic policy adjustments\" to expand domestic demand and lift confidence. \"Currently China's economy is facing new difficulties and challenges, which mainly arise from insufficient domestic demand, difficulties in the operation of some enterprises, risks and hidden dangers in key areas, as well as a grim and complex external environment,\" Xinhua quoted the Politburo as saying at a meeting chaired by Chinese President Xi Jinping. China's economy slowed down from April to June because of weaker demand at home and aboard, although it did expand by 6.3 per cent over the year to June, a step up from the year to March. Economists at Barclays say while the Politburo meeting signalled more support for the economy, it fell short of offering large scale stimulus. \"We view this as a signal that the government would stabilise growth around its target but refrain from an outsized policy response, given the top leaders' intended shift in focus to \"quality growth.\" Barclay's Yingke Zhou, Ying Zhang, and Jian Chang are predicting more targeted stimulus instead of the big spending packages of the past. They expect further interest rate cuts, more special bond issuance by local governments, and other measures including lending by policy banks to support infrastructure investment, especially green infrastructure investment. \"We think the PBOC (People's Bank of China) has already entered a rate cutting cycle, and expect a 10 basis point (0.1 percentage point) cut every quarter through the first quarter of 2024 to reduce financing costs in the economy, along with 40 to 60 basis points of mortgage rate cuts for both existing and new housing loans.\" They also expect the central bank to further lower funding costs for financial institutions. The Politburo also called for measures to encourage spending on big ticket items including cars, electronic products and furniture, as well as promoting spending on services like sports and leisure. China's Commerce Ministry has already announced a plan to boost consumption of household goods, which includes a directive to local governments to increase the renovation of old homes. China's economic planning agency, the National Development and Reform Commission, has also outlined measures to promote private investment.",

Energy stocks are on the up, with Santos gaining 1.1 per cent so far. Despite the good performances, the gains across the broader index are being capped by falls in the financials sector — shares in Westpac have dropped 1.4 per cent.
