Global shares rose overnight as investors await US consumer inflation data, which could see the US Federal Reserve pull back on its interest rate hikes. US inflation is forecast to have increased by 3.1 per cent in June, which would the lowest reading since March 2021, following a 4 per cent increase in May. The Dow Jones index rose nearly 1 per cent, while the S & P 500 and the Nasdaq also gained. Company profit reporting season in the US begins on Friday with big banks including JP Morgan set to report. Coming up today the focus will be a speech by Reserve Bank governor Philip Lowe as the Federal Treasurer prepares to announce the next RBA boss. The RBA governor will discuss the overhaul of the central bank and monetary policy. And ANZ and National Australia Bank face a grilling by the House of Representatives economics committee.
