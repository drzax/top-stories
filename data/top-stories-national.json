Last month, Qantas announced that chief financial officer Vanessa Hudson would take over from Alan Joyce, becoming the airline's first female chief executive. Today Qantas announced that Qantas head of strategy, people and technology, Rob Marcolina, will become the new chief financial officer. Chief customer office Markus Svensson will become Qantas Domestic chief executive when Andrew David retires in September. Catriona Larritt will take on the role of chief customer and digital officer with responsibility for technology added to the job. Safety boss Andrew Monaghan will take on the new role of chief risk officer, and the airline will create a chief people officer to oversee human resources and industrial relations. Here's what Vanessa Hudson had to say. “We have a deep bench of experience at Qantas, which means we’re able to recruit internally for many senior executive roles when they come up, and that makes transition a lot smoother,\" Ms Hudson says. “The structural changes announced today are about increasing our focus on a few key areas as we move from recovery to growth, especially when it comes to things that matter most to our people and our customers.\" 'Investing in digital is a huge part of our plans to keep improving customer experience. \" \"That's why we are adding responsibility for technology to the chief customer officer's portfolio.\"",
