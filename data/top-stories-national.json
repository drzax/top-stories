Speaking in Canberra about the figures, Mr Chalmers said the 1.2% September increase was consistent with Treasury forecasts, but warned further volatility in inflation is likely in coming months in response to oil markets and fuel prices. \"Production cuts and disruptions in global oil markets are a key driver of inflation in the global economy and here at home, with Australians facing higher fuel prices at the bowser,\" he said. \"Petrol prices increased 7.2% in the [September] quarter, contributing a quarter of a percentage point to quarterly inflation. \"We shouldn't be surprised to see some volatility in inflation figures going forward, particularly given the global uncertainty from the conflict in the Middle East and the war in Ukraine. \"We understand that inflation and higher interest rates that are already in the system are biting households hard and we're acting to make things a little easier.\"",
