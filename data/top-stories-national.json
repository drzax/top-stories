Only four countries of the 15 UNSC members joined Russia in voting for the resolution. Four countries, including the United States, voted against it. Six countries abstained. Russia's UN ambassador, Vassily Nebenzia, had urged support for the resolution to respond to the \"unprecedented exacerbation\" of the situation, citing the council's inaction since the October 7 attack by Hamas. A vote on a rival resolution from Brazil that would condemn the Hamas attack was delayed. The Russian draft resolution would have called for \"an immediate, durable and fully respected humanitarian cease-fire\" and \"strongly condemns all violence and hostilities directed against civilians and all acts of terrorism\". The Brazilian draft resolution calls for \"humanitarian pauses\" and also \"firmly condemns all violence and hostilities against civilians and all acts of terrorism\". But it also \"unequivocally rejects and condemns the heinous terrorist attacks by Hamas\". AP",

The video was posted on Hamas' Telegram channel and shows a young woman with a bandaged arm speaking Hebrew. She says her name is Mia Schem, she is 21 years old and from Shoham, near Tel Aviv. In the video she asks to be returned to her family as quickly as possible. A representative of the family, which was among a group of French families that appealed last week to President Emmanuel Macron to help free their missing relatives, confirmed her identity to Reuters. The Israel Defense Forces reacted to the video and said that Schem's family was notified of her abduction last week and that they are in continuous contact with them at this time. \"In the video, Hamas is trying to portray itself as a humane organization, while it is a responsible for the murder and abduction of babies, women, children, and elderly,\" the IDF statement said.

Antony Blinken has been in discussions with Israeli leaders, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. He says the US and Israel \"have agreed to develop a plan that will enable humanitarian aid from donor nations and multilateral organisations to reach civilians in Gaza\". \"It is critical that aid begin flowing into Gaza as soon as possible,\" Mr Blinken says. \"We share Israel's concern that Hamas may seize or destroy aid entering Gaza or otherwise prevent it from reaching the people who need it. \"If Hamas in any way blocks humanitarian assistance from reaching civilians including by seizing the aid itself, we'll be the first to come to condemn it and work to prevent it from happening again. \"The president very much looks forward to discussing it further when he's here on Wednesday.\" Other talking points flagged by Mr Blinken include the US reaffirming its commitment \"that Israel has the right to defend its people from Hamas\". He says Mr Biden will send a \"crystal clear message\" that no other nation should \"take advantage of this crisis to attack Israel\". \"To that end, [Mr Biden] has deployed two aircraft carrier groups and other military assets to the region,\" Mr Blinken says. The release of hostages and a \"comprehensive brief on Israel's war aims and strategy\" are also on the agenda. White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby says Mr Biden will travel to Jordan after his trip to Israel to meet with King Abdullah, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas.",

Here are some of the key points he made: Last week we categorised the November board meeting as 'live'. And we ascribed a 40% probability to a 25bp rate increase. The October board minutes confirm that the November board meeting is 'live'. Indeed, the minutes today have a slightly more hawkish tone than the September board minutes. The minutes today confirm that the board once again considered two options for monetary policy in October: raising the cash rate target by a further 25bp or holding the cash rate target steady. These two options have been considered at each of the last six board meetings. We believe the minutes today were used as a vehicle to keep markets on notice that the tightening cycle is not necessarily over given \"the monthly CPI indicator suggested that progress in lowering services price inflation remained slow\". The minutes reiterated the RBA's hiking bias from the September board minutes. Namely, that \"some further tightening of policy may be required should inflation prove more persistent than expected.\" But importantly, today's minutes contained a new line, which was hawkish. Specifically that, \"the board has a low tolerance for a slower return of inflation to target than currently expected.\" This aligns with what we stated last week. The RBA is willing to take a little longer than other central banks to return inflation to the target band to preserve as many of the gains in the labour market as is possible. But the board are not willing to let inflation sit above the target band for too long.",

As a result, the board reiterated that some further tightening may be required to bring inflation down Rates have already risen by 400 basis points to an 11-year high and the RBA judged the full effects of that tightening were yet to be felt. A recent rise in petrol prices could influence inflation expectations. The key inflation report for the third quarter is out on October 25. Markets currently imply only a 16 per cent chance of a hike in November, but that would increase should inflation surprise on the high side. The board was also concerned that the sustained rebound in housing prices could be a signal that the currency policy stance was not as restrictive as had been assumed and could be supporting household consumption. On the other side of the arguments, the labour market has reached a turning point, output growth has slowed and it would take some time for the full effects of the tightening so far to be observed in the data. Required mortgage payments increased to 9.9 per cent of the household disposable income in August, above the previous estimated historical peak. With Reuters",
