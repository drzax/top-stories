The Israeli Defense Force's (IDF) high command had difficulty getting a picture of what was going on because the militants had simultaneously attacked all the military outposts along the border, including the headquarters of the Gaza Division. But within a few days, the estimate rose to 1,500 to 2,000 militants entering through 20 points across the 58-kilometre border fence. Now, after interrogating captured militants, the IDF has a clearer picture of the sheer scale of the attack. It estimates that some 3,000 members of Hamas's military wing infiltrated Israel through dozens of points along the border fence as well as by air (in the form of a paraglider) and sea. This number does not include Gazan civilians who crossed through the torn down fence at about 11am in the second mass wave, some of whom killed people, took hostages and looted. By the time Israel regained control two days later, the security forces had killed 1,000 militants and captured 200. The rest either managed to return to the Gaza Strip or their bodies are still laying around the Israeli border communities. The IDF expects to finish collecting the militants' bodies in the coming days after making sure they aren't booby-trapped.",

He said 23 people, including 20 Australians, had registered with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and left Gaza through the Rafah border crossing. “They were met by Australian consular officials who are on the ground in Egypt who were able to provide assistance with ongoing travel arrangements,” he said. “Crossings like this are the result of an enormous effort from Australian consular officials and diplomats in the region.” He said the 20 Australians were in contact with consular services but did not say if they would fly back to Australia or elsewhere. “I have heard from so many Australians how much it means to hear an Australian accent, someone from their home country to help them out,” he said. There are no planned repatriation flights for those still stuck in Gaza, with the government saying they can only point to commercial flights for those people.",

The new offer is pitched at a total of approximately $9.53 per share (depending on exchange rate movements) and is the bidder's \"best and final\" offer. The bidders say it's an 8% increase on their previous offer of $8.81 and a 70% premium to Origin's share price a year ago, before the takeover speculation began. The bid was increased after some major shareholders had indicated they would reject the previous offer. Origin's board is recommending shareholders vote in favour of the deal. \"We are pleased to have agreed with the Consortium a significant increase in the cash consideration, reflecting the value of Origin's assets, people, and the company's strategic positioning for the energy transition,\" wrote Origin chair Scott Perkins. \"The revised consideration is now above the top end of the Independent Expert's 30 June 2023 valuation range, allowing all shareholders to receive a certain cash value for their Origin shares. We encourage all shareholders to vote in favour of the Scheme.\" The revised offer clearly hasn't pleased all current investors, with some choosing to sell out today, pushing Origin's share price down 1.8% to $8.91. Shareholders will vote on the deal at a meeting on November 23 .",

The most interest rate sensitive sectors, such as real estate, financials and technology are amongst the top gainers. That's after markets interpreted the Fed's post meeting comments and Jerome Powell's press conference as making another US rate hike very unlikely. In turn, a perceived peak in US rates takes one source of pressure off the Reserve Bank of Australia to raise its cash rate next week. Utilities and energy were the only two sectors in the red, and only slightly.

Former RBA economist and now economics lecturer Dr Zac Gross has penned an interesting article on his blog about why some of those market measures may currently be skewed and slightly understating the market odds for a rate hike. \"The crux of the issue lies in the contractual language of the interbank cash rate futures the foundation of the ASX's published probabilities,\" Dr Gross explains. \"The cash rate futures pay out according to the value of the cash rate averaged over the calendar month — not what the RBA actually targets the cash rate to be. \"Historically the actual cash rate has tracked the target very closely. For instance, if the RBA aims for a cash rate of 4.10%, the monthly average cash rate would typically aligned almost exactly with that 4.10% target. But the introduction of quantitative easing has disrupted this close sure fire aim. The gap between the target cash rate and its actual average opened up during COVID as shown in the bottom panel of the chart below. \"The RBA's recent note on this issue highlights that this gap has reduced to an average of 3 basis points and predicts it will eventually revert to zero once quantitative tightening is fully implemented. \"This seemingly minor gap of 3 basis points can significantly alter the probabilities when determining the likelihood of a 25 basis point movement in the cash rate, a standard unit for an interest rate adjustment. \"Incorporating this spread into the ASX's calculations, the probability shifts from an even 50-50 implied probability to a 65% likelihood of a rate hike .\" It is not clear how this affects the Refinitiv and Bloomberg calculations on interest rate probability, typically used by us at the ABC, and which themselves usually differ slightly between each other.
