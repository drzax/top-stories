The report finds that government contracting \"disproportionately favours larger, politically connected firms\" and that whatever the level of government of the sector the winners have certain things in common. \"They’re old, they’re big, and they make major contributions to political parties.\" The new report Political Economy: The market for government contracts and influence reveals that over the last decade, the value of government contracts in Australia has more than quintupled, to $190 billion in 2022. The contracts are going to the already-big, according to e61 Institute. Nearly 80% of contracts were awarded to firms with over $100m in annual revenue in 2022, up from around 65% in 2014. The total contract value awarded to old firms (20+ years old) has climbed from around 45% in 2014 to 60% in 2022. In 2022, 75% of the value of government contracts went to firms that had won a contract in the previous year. Report author Dan Andrews (not the Victorian premier) says it's a problem because competition keeps prices down. \"There are significant barriers preventing new, innovative firms from securing government contracts. Increasingly, it’s a few select firms to take on these major contracts, and stifling competition in the process.\" \"Frequently these firms are the ones that have secured government contracts in the past. In fact, in 2022 75% of the value of government contracts went to firms that had won a contract in the previous year .\" And for dominant firms — those in the top 10 by revenue — their dominance is being cemented. In 2014 those firms won over 35% of contract value in the professional services industry. By 2022 it was 40%. \"New firms that secure government contracts are more likely to succeed, and thereby increase pressure on existing firms to improve their offerings. But what we’re seeing is a complete entrenchment of a few big players.\" Donation influence The report makes a further controversial point: that government contracts are increasingly going to firms that donate to major political parties. \"Being      a political donor was associated with winning just under $1.5 million more      in contracts in 2014-15, while it was associated with around $11 million      more in contracts in 2021-22,\" the report states.",

Australians have lodged 96,987 complaints with the financial ombudsman in the last year — the most complaints the ombudsman has ever recorded. The top five issues Australians complained about here: Delays in insurance claims (+76%) Unauthorised transactions (+69%) Service quality (-4%) Insurance claim amount (+42%) Denial of insurance claim due to exclusion/condition (+51%) AFCA's chief ombudsman David Locke said he was \"deeply concerned\" about the sheer volume of complaints made by Australians in the last financial year. \"It's not fair on consumers and not good for business. We need to see a significant improvement from firms,\" he said. There was also a 46% increase in scam-related complaints to AFCA in the last financial year. Mr Locke also said there has been a link between the rise in complaints and the impact of financial stress due to rising interest rates and living costs. He said complaints rose significantly towards the end of the financial year — across April, May, and June — when the RBA increased its cash rate target to 4.1%. Financial difficulty complaints alone rose by 9% over the year, but were 31% higher compared to those same three months in the previous financial year (before the RBA began to lift rates).

But the central bank has also hinted that it could pause its current rate hiking cycle at its next meeting, with data suggesting a downturn could be looming in the European economy. The benchmark rate of 3.75% is also the highest its been since the euro was launched back in 1999, and was only this high for borrowing costs in 2000. \"Inflation continues to decline but is still expected to remain too high for too long,\" the central bank said in a statement. \"The developments since the last meeting support the expectation that inflation will drop further over the remainder of the year but will stay above target for an extended period. \"While some measures show signs of easing, underlying inflation remains high overall.\" ECB president Christine Lagarde said there could be a pause in the near future, which would be the first time since it first started lifting rates a year ago. \"We have an open mind as to what the decisions will be in September and in subsequent meetings,\" she said. \" We might hike [or] we might hold .\" As for rate cuts? \"That is a definite no,\" Lagarde said.",
