A grand jury in the state of Georgia is hearing about a two-and-a-half-year investigation into his alleged election interference attempts, including his phone call to Georgia's secretary of state asking him to \"find\" more Trump votes. For days, American media outlets have been reporting live from an Atlanta courthouse on the comings-and-goings of witnesses and jurors and speculating on the timing of an indictment. And a document that was reportedly uploaded to the court's website on Monday lunchtime (local time) made it appear charges had already been filed. A copy of that document, published by the Reuters news agency, lists 13 new charges against Donald Trump. They include violating Georgia's anti-racketeering law, which is punishable by up to 20 years in prison, violation of oath by a public officer, conspiracy to commit impersonating a public officer, conspiracy to commit forgery in the first degree, and filing false documents. Reuters reported the document was removed from the court's website soon after its publication, without explanation. The district attorney's office quickly clarified no charges had been laid. And the office of the Fulton County court clerk has just issued a statement labelling the document as \"fictitious\". \"The Office of the Fulton County Clerk of Superior and Magistrate Courts has learned of a fictitious document that has been circulated online and reported by various media outlets related to The Fulton County Special Purpose Grand Jury,\" it says. \"There have been no documents filed today regarding such.\" Trump, meanwhile, has fired off a series of Truth Social posts protesting his innocence and attacking the prosecutors and judges involved in his multiple court cases. In one of them, he says: \"I UNDERSTAND THROUGH ILLEGAL LEAKS TO THE FAKE NEWS MEDIA THAT PHONEY FANI WILLIS, THE D.A. OF FULTON COUNTY, GEORGIA, WANTS DESPERATELY TO INDICT ME ON THE RIDICULOUS GROUNDS OF TAMPERING WITH THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION. \"NO, I DIDN'T TAMPER WITH THE ELECTION! THOSE WHO RIGGED & STOLE THE ELECTION WERE THE ONES DOING THE TAMPERING, & THEY ARE THE SLIME THAT SHOULD BE PROSECUTED. I MADE A PERFECT PHONE CALL OF PROTEST. WHY WASN'T THIS FAKE CASE BROUGHT 2.5 YEARS AGO? ELECTION INTERFERENCE!\"",

The new indictment from prosecutors accuses the 31-year-old former billionaire of using stolen customer funds to make more than $US100 million ($154 million) in campaign contributions ahead of the 2022 US midterm elections. Bankman-Fried is facing seven counts of conspiracy and fraud over the collapse of FTX, and has previously pleaded not guilty. He was sent to jail last week after having his bail revoked, and is due to face a fraud trial on October 2 over FTX's collapse. The US Attorney's office in Manhattan had initially charged him with violating US campaign finance laws, but dropped that charge in late July after the Bahamas said it had never intended to extradite Bankman-Fried to the US on that charge. FTX was based in the Bahamas and Bankman-Fried was arrested there in December 2022.",

Companies reporting profit results today include vaccine maker CSL, jobs website Seek and Treasury Wine Estates.
