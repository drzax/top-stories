              "plaintext": "Fuel retailer Ampol has reported a 54% drop in first-half refining margins at its Lytton refinery in Queensland, impacted by a five-week long outage at the plant and weaker pricing of its products. The outage prevented Ampol from producing petrol from late March to early May. For the half-year ended June 30, Ampol's Lytton refinery margin was $US10.29 per barrel (compared with $US22.35 per barrel a year ago). Ampol, however, said that the Lytton refinery margin for June improved to $US12.69 per barrel (reflecting an improved production mix as the refinery returned to normal operations by the end of May as planned). The company also reported $575 million in unaudited earnings before interest and taxes on a replacement cost basis (RCOP EBIT) for the first half. It was significantly lower than the previous year's RCOP EBIT of $693.1 million.",

It's expected to give startups and other businesses a powerful free-of-charge alternative to pricey proprietary models sold by OpenAI and Google. The new version of the model, called Llama 2, will be distributed by Microsoft through its Azure cloud service and will run on the Windows operating system, Meta said in a blog post, referring to Microsoft as \"our preferred partner\" for the release. The model, which Meta previously provided only to select academics for research purposes, also will be made available via direct download and through Amazon Web Services, Hugging Face and other providers, according to the blog post and a separate Facebook post by Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg. \"Open source drives innovation because it enables many more developers to build with new technology,\" Zuckerberg wrote. \"I believe it would unlock more progress if the ecosystem were more open.\" Making a model as sophisticated as Llama widely available and free for businesses to build atop threatens to upend the early dominance established in the nascent market for generative AI software by players like OpenAI, which Microsoft backs and whose models it already offers to business customers via Azure. The first Llama was already competitive with models that power OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google's Bard chatbot, while the new Llama has been trained on 40% more data than its predecessor, with more than 1 million annotations by humans to fine-tune the quality of its outputs, Zuckerberg said. \"Commercial Llama could change the picture,\" said Amjad Masad, chief executive at software developer platform Replit, who said more than 80% of projects there use OpenAI's models. \"Any incremental improvement in open-source models is eating into the market share.\" - Reuters",
