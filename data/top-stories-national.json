The ASX 200 was up 1 point at 7,253 around 10:15am AEST — that's point, not per cent — and the All Ords was down 2 points at 7,448. Most companies in the top 200 were doing well, with 131 in the black and only 65 in the red. But the mining sector, notably the big iron ore miners, were among those losing ground, weighing on the index as a whole. BHP (-1.7%), Rio Tinto (-1.4%) and Fortescue (-1.6%) were all down after spot iron ore prices dropped below $US100 a tonne, continuing recent trends on signs of Chinese economic weakness. QBE was another big company dragging on the market — investors clearly not impressed with its first quarter performance update, despite 11% growth in gross written premium. The company did warn about the cost of a number of natural disasters, which is already creeping towards its first half catastrophe allowance with a couple of months yet to go. QBE shares were down 5.1 per cent to $14.39. Healthcare, education and consumer cyclicals were today's leading sectors, with energy joining mining as the laggards. The big four banks were up between 0.2 and 1 per cent, with Westpac leading. Five biggest gains on ASX 200: News Corp: +4.1% to $25.81 GrainCorp: +2.6% to $8.015 Sayona Mining: +2.4% to $0.215 Imugene: +2.1% to $0.1225 Polynovo: +1.6% to $1.4125 Five biggest losses on ASX 200: Sandfire Resources: -5.2% to $6.16 QBE Insurance: -4.8% to $14.43 Champion Iron: -3.7% to $6.20 Regis Resources: -3.7% to $2.07 Paladin Energy: -3.7% to $0.66",

              "plaintext": "There's been huge debate on this topic since Tuesday night's Commonwealth budget. A lot of economists, such as Steven Hamilton and Chris Richardson, argue measures to relieve the cost of living such as power bill subsidies will leave households with more money to spend and thus be inflationary, at least to some degree. But the Commonwealth Bank's head of Australian economics Gareth Aird, who was recently in the minority of market economists who successfully forecast the RBA's May rate hike, believes the budget may even help bring down inflation, as the Treasurer has claimed. \"The Government's Energy Price Relief Plan is expected to subtract 0.75ppts [percentage points] from headline inflation in 2023/24. Medicare bulk billing incentives along with childcare subsidies will also put downward pressure directly on measured inflation. \"It can be argued that these packages free up some consumer cash flow to spend on other goods and services. And therefore the second round impacts of the package are inflationary. But we don't subscribe to that view. \"Inflation expectations are a driver of inflation over the medium term. And inflation expectation can be heavily influenced by actual inflation. Lowering measured inflation in the short run at a time when there remains lingering concerns around inflation psychology makes a lot of sense. It is both smart politics and smart economics. \"Many wage agreements and price outcomes are set with the level of actual inflation in mind. If measured inflation recedes more quickly it can dampen down the consumer and business expectation of entrenching price rises – a welcome outcome.\" Westpac's chief economist Bill Evans has a slightly different view, but still thinks the budget will, at most, be a \"second order\" consideration for the RBA and unlikely to affect interest rates this year. \"Our analysis points to the Budget being more expansionary than we saw in any of budgets the ten years before the pandemic,\" he wrote. \"The Budget is still unlikely to be a core factor for the rate decision in August, but may delay the timing of the first rate cut in 2024.\" My colleague Kate Ainsworth had a comprehensive article earlier this week featuring both sides of the debate.",
