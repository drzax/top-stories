The Houthi's military spokesperson said they had launched \"a barrage of ballistic missiles\" at southern Israel, but did not mention drones in their statement. No-one was physically hurt in the explosion at the Eilat elementary school caused by the unidentified drone, but paramedics were treating seven people for shock, said an army spokeswoman at the scene. Emergency services confirmed the details separately. Residents clustered around the school complex, which was cordoned off by dozens of soldiers and police officers, an AFP reporter witnessed. Later on Thursday, the military said its Arrow air defence system intercepted a missile launched at Israeli territory near the Red Sea, and that its Patriot defence system had intercepted a \"suspicious target\" in the southern Negev desert. The Houthis said they launched a batch of ballistic missiles at various Israeli targets including what the group's military spokesperson described as military targets in Eilat. Houthi military spokesman Yahya Saree claimed \"direct hits\" after targeting \"various sensitive targets of the Israeli entity … including military targets in the area of Umm al-Rashrash\", the Arabic name of the town that stood where Eilat now is. Israel's military did not attribute blame for the missile launch or the target intercepted in the Negev. Israeli military spokesman Daniel Hagari told reporters the army was monitoring threats in the region, including against Eilat on the Red Sea coast. The Houthis have launched repeated missile and drone attacks on Israel since October 7 but all were either shot down or fell short. Reuters/AFP",

                "plaintext": "Israel has agreed to pause military operations in parts of north Gaza for four hours a day from Thursday (local time), the White House said. The pauses, which would allow people to flee along two humanitarian corridors and could be used for the release of hostages, were significant first steps, White House national security spokesperson John Kirby said. But as night approached, there were no immediate reports of a lull in fighting raging among the ruined buildings in the north of the Gaza Strip. There was also no direct confirmation from Israel, which spoke more generally of measures that appeared to correspond to arrangements already in place. \"We are undertaking localised and pinpoint measures to enable the exit of Palestinian civilians from Gaza City southward, so that we do not harm them. These things do not detract from the war fighting,\" Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said. However, he reiterated there would be no full ceasefire for now. \"We will not stop fighting as long as our hostages are in Gaza and as long as we have not completed our mission, which is toppling the Hamas regime and eliminating its military and governance capabilities,\" he said. Israeli forces completely encircled Gaza City in recent days and the military has been allowing civilians safe passage along the main route south for three or four hours each day, with ever-growing numbers of families opting to escape.

Optus should forfeit my next bill also... - Natty. Hey Natty, Always great to hear from you, and sorry to hear you were impacted by Wednesday's outage. A lot of Optus customers are unimpressed (to say the least) about the offer of extra data to make up for a day of no coverage, especially small business owners who couldn't operate normally. Other telcos have said Wednesday was one of their busiest days in a year, and there's plenty of anecdotal reports of people swapping providers or trying to get compensation from Optus that isn't free data. Many consumers are arguing their losses are worth much more than the compensation Optus has offered, but legally speaking, the telco might owe you nothing. So, what rights do you have, and what obligations does Optus have in return? My colleagues Leonie Thorne and consumer affairs reporter Michael Atkin have put together a guide to help you understand your rights — you can read it below:",
