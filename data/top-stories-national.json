Investors are still digesting the latest unemployment figures, and crucially, what it might been for interest rates ahead of the RBA's meeting next month. As Gareth has mentioned, some economists still think there's a red-hot chance of another hike or two coming our way from the central bank — but we will get a better picture when we get inflation data next Wednesday. Taking a look at the sectors, technology is the best performer, up 0.4%, with real estate close behind at 0.3%. Financials and consumer non-cyclicals are also up 0.1% each, while the rest of the sectors are in the red, with industrials and healthcare down 0.5% each. The top five performers so far: Mineral Resources +4.9% Flight Centre +4.1% Megaport +3.6% Ampol +2.9% Lendlease +2.9% And the worst performers so far today: Telix Pharmaceuticals -13.4% Northern Star Resources -5.4% Sayona Mining -2.8% BrainChip Holdings -2.5% Boral -2.3%",
