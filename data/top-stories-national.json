They should not be marketed to kids,\" he says. Federal crossbenchers will meet today with members of the alcohol industry, to discuss concerns around alcoholic drinks being marketed to underage drinkers and whether more regulation is needed. Independent MP Kylea Tink tells ABC News Breakfast that Hard Solo doesn't pass \"the pub test\". \"We know young Australians have a particular taste for premixed drinks. Myself and my colleagues from the crossbench are meeting with the industry to really have that conversation of, 'Where is the line? And if this product isn't passing the pub test, what happens when a product crosses that line?'\" \"My main concern is the fact this product was approved through the self-regulatory environment. I think this is a clear breach of what the intention of that self-regulatory code is all about.\"",

However, the company lamented some disappointing box office results for films including Elemental and the latest Indiana Jones adventure. It also reported another drop in subscriber numbers for Disney+ to 146.1 million, down 7.4%, mainly due to the loss of broadcasting rights for Indian Premier League cricket. The relevant Disney+ Hotstar product lost 24% of its users. Earnings per share was slightly higher on an adjusted basis, while revenue was a touch lower than typical forecasts. The broadcaster took $US2.65 billion in one-time write-downs and charges, which dragged it to a $US460 million net loss.",

It might be hard to believe that an electricity and gas company could possibly lose money given current power bills, but that's exactly what AGL did last year. It's reported a $1, 264 million net statutory loss for financial year 2023, which just ended on June 30. How did it lose so much money? There's two main reasons: It wrote down the value of its coal power plants by $680 million after deciding to close some of them earlier than previously planned. It lost $890 million from the value of various financial instruments, mostly futures contracts for electricity, after government intervention and market forces caused the wholesale price of power to drop dramatically late last year. AGL was stuck with contracts that were above the new market pricing. Excluding those write-downs, AGL's underlying net profit after tax was $281 million, up 25%. And if you think that still sounds small in a sector where retail prices have just jumped by around 20-30%, then don't worry, AGL is about to make up for it. It has reiterated its forecasts for an underlying net profit of between $580 and $780 million for the current 2024 financial year. That is somewhere between double and nearly triple this year's profit. As a 'gentailer' — a power generator who also retails to customers — AGL is benefitting from \"sustained periods of higher wholesale electricity pricing\" and expected improved power plant availability, with less forced outages. However, it says inflation, difficulty collecting debts of some customers and increased maintenance spend will cap profit growth. This blog covered AGL's June announcement about its updated profit forecasts, below.",
