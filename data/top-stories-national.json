Premier Li is China's second-highest-ranking official after President Xi Jinping, who has opted not to attend a series of global summits underway this week. There had been hopes Albanese might meet President Xi at the G20 leader's summit in Delhi this weekend, re-creating a significant meeting of the two leaders at last year's G20 summit in Bali. But with that no longer an option, it is now expected the PM will meet Premier Li instead. It's anticipated the two leaders would meet ahead of the East Asia Summit, which brings together South-East Asian leaders with leaders of countries like Australia, Japan, China, Russia and the USA. While diplomatic and trade relations between Australia and China have improved substantially in recent months, there are some substantial issues that might be raised. Trade barriers remain in place on Australian wine exports, and ministers have spoken out in recent months calling for their removal. Two Australians also remain detained in Beijing —\njournalist Cheng Lei, and writer Dr Yang Hengjun. The government has openly called for both Australians to be reunited with their families, and Foreign Minister Penny Wong yesterday told the ABC that officials were continuing that pressure. \"We are deeply concerned about Ms Cheng Lei and Dr Yang, as are so many Australians,\" she said. \"And we have continued to raise with our counterparts at every level the desire of Australia to see both Ms Cheng Lei and Dr Yang reunited with their families. \"We'll continue to make those representations.\"",
