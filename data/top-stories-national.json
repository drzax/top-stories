The Council of Foreign Relations (CFR) convened an expert panel and the first question asked was, well, what would an escalation look like? Lowy distinguished fellow in US-Middle East diplomacy at the CFR Martin S Indyk said: \"I think there's a high potential for escalation just because Israel is inevitably going to retaliate in a very strong way, possibly—I would say at this point even likely — go into Gaza. And the result of that would be a very high loss of life on the Palestinian side.\" Indyk said the role of Iran in the attack on Israel was not yet clear. \"But if this is coordinated, as I suspect it is, then I think we can see a situation where Hezbollah could well join in, and then we've got a regional conflagration the dimensions on which we have not seen,\" he said. \"Hopefully we can head that off, but it's not going to be easy. There's a potential for eruption in the West Bank. Terrorist attacks against Israeli settlers would draw another harsh response in the West Bank. \"There is a high potential for escalation.\"",

Retired General Giora Eiland, a former head of Israel's National Security Council told Reuters Israel was surprised. \"As we can see it, Israel was completely surprised, by a very well coordinated attack,\" he says. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's right-wing government has always made great play of its security credentials and taken an uncompromising stance towards the Palestinian militant factions including Hamas, which has controlled Gaza since 2007. However when the time came, Israel's security apparatus appeared to break down as a force of Hamas gunmen estimated in the hundreds by the military broke through security fences and scattered into towns. \"This was an intelligence failure; it could not be otherwise,\" says Jonathan Panikoff, the US government's former deputy national intelligence officer on the Middle East. \"It was a security failure, undermining what was thought to be an aggressive and successful layered approach toward Gaza by Israel,\" he said. An army spokesman told Reuters there would be discussions on the intelligence preparation \"down the road\" but for the moment the focus was on fighting. \"We'll talk about that when we need to talk about it,\" he says.
