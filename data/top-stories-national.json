The Commonwealth Bank lifted its variable home loan rate for the fourth time in three months, on top of Reserve Bank rate increases. The CBA increased the rate on its Wealth Package home by 0.1 percentage points for new customers according to RateCity. The lowest variable rate for CBA Wealth Package customers has risen by 0.82 percentage points since March 1, while existing customers have seen their rates rise by 0.5 percentage points. The move follows the National Australia Bank lifting variable rates for some new customers yesterday. RateCity.com.au research director, Sally Tindall says the big banks are trying to boost their squeezed profit margins. “Things are looking increasingly bleak for new customers hoping to get a loan with Australia’s biggest bank.” “The rising cost of funding is putting pressure on the bank’s (CBA's) profit margins for new customers. \" CBA has decided to protect this margin, even if it means potentially missing out on new business.\"",

The Reserve Bank of New Zealand has just raised its official cash rate again, from 5.25% to 5.5%. The RBA's cash rate here is still only 3.85%, despite 11 rate rises over the past year and a bit. The New Zealand economy has already suffered one quarter of contraction, at the end of last year, and another quarter would confirm that the RBNZ has pushed the economy into recession in its efforts to stamp out inflation. It is also worth noting that headline inflation in New Zealand was lower (6.7%) in the March quarter than in Australia (7%). That's the outcome that Australia's Reserve Bank is trying to avoid by staying on its \"narrow path\". The RBNZ's decision was not unanimous, with a summary of the meeting showing that board members voted on two options, a pause or a 0.25 percentage point rate hike. Two voted in favour of the pause, while the other five board members voted for the hike. The RBNZ does look like it is at, or getting close to, the top of its rate rise cycle, noting that the economy was already slowing down quite dramatically. \"Consumer spending growth has eased and residential construction activity has declined, while house prices have returned to more sustainable levels,\" it noted in its post-meeting press release. \"More generally, businesses are reporting slower demand for their goods and services, and weak investment intentions. \"Businesses report that a lack of demand, rather than labour shortages, is now the main constraint on activity.\"",
