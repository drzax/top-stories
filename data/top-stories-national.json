The Islamic militant group says it released 85-year-old Yocheved Cooper and 79-year-old Nurit Lifshitz for \"humanitarian reasons\" and Israel has confirmed the women are now in Egypt. Two other hostages were released over the weekend, but 220 others are still being held captive in Gaza. The Red Cross says it facilitated the release of the hostages by transporting them out of Gaza this evening. It said: \"Our role as a neutral intermediary between the warring parties makes this work possible. We are ready to visit the remaining hostages and to facilitate any future release. We are glad that these persons will be soon reunited with their families and loved ones.\"",
