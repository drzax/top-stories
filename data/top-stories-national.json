Other companies are eyeing it off. On Monday this week another lithium miner Albemarle upped its offer to buy Liontown, increasing it to $3 a share, valuing Liontown at $6.6 billion. The $3 offer was higher than Albemarle's $2.50 offer back in March - Liontown rejected that back then saying it was far too low. Liontown shares rose to about $2.89 on Monday, but this afternoon they've soared again, jumping 8.3 per cent to now be valued at that Albemarle offer of $3 a share. It's fulling speculation there may be a rival bid in the works for Liontown, with some reports saying i ron ore mogul Gina Rinehart could be behind it. She is said to hold just under a 5 per cent stake in the company already. Albemarle has been pursuing Liontown since October last year, when it made a $2.20 a share offer.",

He noted that inflation had been wildly different during his time as RBA governor â and more than it had been in two decades. When he began as RBA governor, inflation was below that sweet spot of the 2-3% range we hear about so often, and as we know, inflation rose to its highest level in more than 30 years recently. Overall, he said underlying inflation was averaging 2.7% in his seven-year term, while headline inflation was around 3%. But he does expect that inflation will swing more wildly than it has ever before because of the increased prevalence of supply shocks (like what we saw during the pandemic) plus c limate change, energy transitions and changing demographics. \"My view is that it will be difficult to return to the earlier world in which inflation tracked in a very narrow range,\" he said. That doesn't mean the end of inflation targeting, however â he remains a strong advocate for that 2-3% range.",
