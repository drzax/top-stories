The ASX 200 ended up by 0.2 per cent or 13 points. 120 of the top 200 stocks made gains, led by the top movers: Karoon Energy (+4.2%) Domino's Pizza (+4%) NRW Holdings (+3.8%) New Hope (+3.2%) Beach Energy (+3.2%) The bottom performers of the session were: ResMed (-9.3%) Block (-5.8%) Syrah Resources (-4.2%) Core Lithium (-3.8%) Sayona Mining (-3.3%) Other notable moves were in the banking space, with ANZ (+0.8%) and Suncorp (+0.6%) both finishing higher in the end. ANZ says it will be seeking an \"independent decision\" on the ACCC's move to block its acquisition of Suncorp, so expect an appeal to Australian Competition Tribunal. Iron ore miners also rose strongly, with BHP gaining 1.1 per cent. Despite the Friday gain, the benchmark index still ends the week down by around 1.1 per cent — snapping a streak of three weekly rises. We'll be back with you first thing Monday, as the Australian reporting season starts to kick into gear, with CBA results on Wednesday a big focus. In the meantime, I hope the weekend is very near.

Now, China's Ministry of Commerce has confirmed the news, which will come into effect tomorrow. The two countries reached an agreement to end the trade dispute back in April. It's the latest step in an improving relationship between Australia and China, with coal imports resuming in January and timber imports also back on the cards. Despite the size of the Chinese market, the steep tariffs didn't wipe out Australia barley growers, who turned to other markets. You can read more here:",
