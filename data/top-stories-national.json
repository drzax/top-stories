According to the press release from Attorney-General Mark Dreyfus : This paper is a direct result of feedback received through a national roundtable on personal insolvency which I chaired in March this year. As a result of this discussion my department identified the following priorities for further scrutiny: an increase to the bankruptcy      threshold; an increase to the timeframe a      debtor has to respond to a bankruptcy notice; a reduction in the period of      time for which a discharged bankrupt is recorded on the National Personal      Insolvency Index; and amending the Bankruptcy Act      1966 so that an ‘act of bankruptcy’ is not taken to have occurred      where a debtor submits a debt agreement proposal to the Official Receiver,      or where a debt agreement proposal is accepted by creditors. The Australian Government is committed to an effective bankruptcy system that serves debtors while also protecting the rights of creditors. Submissions will close on 29 September 2023 and I encourage all interested stakeholders to participate as the government finalises these important reforms. To access the review’s consultation paper and to make submissions visit the Attorney-General's Department website:",

The ABC understands it happened weeks ago, well before the recent collection of resignations that have hit the troubled company. But he has now joined Tivan Limited (ASX: TVN), a small cap critical minerals company. Tivan informed the Australian Securities Exchange of Debelle's move this morning, saying he's agreed to join the board of Tivan in the role of non-executive director, effective as of 1 September 2023. \"After leaving the RBA, Dr Debelle worked at Fortescue Future Industries as CFO and non-executive director,\" the statement says. \"Other precious positions he has held include: the International Monetary Fund, Bank for International Settlements, Australian Treasury, visiting Professor of Economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, chair of the Global Foreign Exchange Committee, chair of the Council of Financial Regulators working group on Climate Finance, chair of the BIS Markets Committee.\" Tivan says Debelle has confirmed his intention to invest $25,000 in the company by way of a private placement of shares at a price of 7.2 cents, consistent with the investment made by his fellow directors in the placement announced on 12 July 2023. It says this is subject to the approval of shareholders at the Company's 2023 annual general meeting. Dr Debelle said in a statement: \"I am excited to join Tivan who are focused on realising the great opportunity Australia has in the green transition, particularly in the critical minerals space. I am looking forward to working with the team to further enhance Tivan's inclusive and sustainable approach to developing its resources to benefit the community and deliver value for its shareholders.\"",
