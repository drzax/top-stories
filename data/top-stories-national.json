The experienced French diver on board, Paul-Henri Nargoelet, would be key to directing the other four passengers on how to keep calm and control their breathing, Owen says. The US and Canadian coast guards are still searching an area the size of about 26,000 square kilometres — that's more than twice the size of greater Sydney. The underwater \"banging\" noises picked up on Tuesday have \"yielded negative results\" so far, the US coast guard says. We'll continue to keep you updated over the next couple of hours.",

Loibl said he paid $US110,000 (about $162,500) for a dive in 2019 that fell through when the first submersible didn't survive testing. Two years later, he went on a successful voyage along with two men from England, as well as OceanGate chief executive Stockton Rush and French diver Paul-Henri Nargeolet, who are missing on the current voyage. The dive was repeatedly delayed to fix a problem with the battery and the balancing weights, Loibl said. \"I was a bit naive, looking back now,\" he said. Reporting by AP",
