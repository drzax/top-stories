He said there will be five main themes covered in the paper. \"What you'll see in the employment white paper is amongst these five themes, whether its full employment, job security and wages, productivity, growth, skills, needs and overcoming barriers to employment is a real way to try and find where there's the common ground between employers and workers, and the education system and governments at all levels ,\" he said. \"We've all got an interest in a more productive, competitive and innovative economy. \"We've all got an interest in creating opportunities and making sure that people can grasp those opportunities in more parts of Australia and you'll be hearing a lot more about that today.\" He said there will be priority areas identified in the white paper, with the aim to double apprenticeship commencements, which includes supporting TAFE centres to ensure workers can be trained and upskilled. \"We broadly know how our economy and how our society is changing, we know from the Intergenerational Report that we will need more care and support workers, that we'll need more workers in the net zero economy, we need our workers to be better able to adapt and adopt technology ,\" he said. \"And we need to make sure that we can train people to grab those opportunities, and so that employers can find the people that they need when they need them. \"So this new announcement today, turbocharging the TAFE centres of excellence, and accelerating those higher apprenticeships, is all about finding the workers that we need for the economy of the future .\" We'll find out for sure in a little less than an hour — the report is being released at midday AEST .",

There is certainly a lot of concern around what impact Russia's indefinite ban on diesel exports is going to have on oil and diesel prices globally — and we're not exempt from it here in Australia. If you're not as up to speed with the news as David, a couple of days ago Russia announced it would introduce \"temporary\" restrictions on diesel exports to stabilise fuel prices in Russia. The ban however doesn't have an end date, and came into immediate effect, and applies to all countries except for Belarus, Kazakhstan, Armenia and Kyrgyzstan. Russia is one of the world's biggest oil producers, and has been faced with a shortage of fuel, with the Russian government blaming the shortfall on exports. President Vladimir Putin has also said the government had failed to react in time to the rising oil prices on global markets. When news of the ban broke, diesel prices in Europe jumped by 5% to more than $1,000 a tonne. So with rising prices, plus already low levels of diesel inventories and no end date in sight for this ban, on top of OPEC+ production cuts, there is concern what this all might mean as the northern hemisphere begins to cool off ahead of winter. But just how deep the impact will be ultimately depends on how long this ban lasts — however right now, markets are feeling pretty negatively about it all, to say the least.",

The 12-time Grammy Award winner accepted Travis Kelce 's invitation to see the Kansas City Chiefs play the Chicago Bears at Arrowhead Stadium. Rumours have been flying recently that the global pop superstar and footballer have been seeing each other. It all began when Kelce said on his New Heights podcast that he was disappointed that he didn't have the chance to meet Swift and gift her a friendship bracelet during her stop in Kansas City on her Eras Tour. Then, during an appearance on The Pat McAfee Show, Kelce said: \"I threw the ball in her court and told her, 'I've seen you rock the stage in Arrowhead. You might have to come see me rock the stage in Arrowhead and see which one's a little more lit.'\" Swift is currently on a break from her sold-out Eras world tour, which resumes in November.",
