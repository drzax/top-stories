After edging lower yesterday, ASX futures are pointing to gains on the local share market when it opens for trade later this morning. It follows a pretty good night for global stocks — the major indices rose on Wall Street and European markets were also mostly higher. Energy was the best performing sector on the S & P 500 as oil prices rose. And shares in Mattel rose 1.8 per cent thanks to the strong opening of 'Barbie', which brought in $US155 million at American cinemas over the weekend. US investors are bracing for news on corporate earnings this week, with big tech stocks closely watched. It also comes ahead of a string of global central bank meetings this week, with the US Fed decision due early Thursday morning our time. While a rate hike is broadly expected, market pricing suggests it could be the last for a while. The European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan are also meeting in coming days. And locally, all eyes are on what St George economists are calling \"inflation D-Day\" tomorrow. \"The stickiness of inflation remains a key question. Sticky services inflation has been observed overseas and the jury is not yet out on whether our experience will be the same,\" writes St George economist Jameson Coombs. Stick with us this morning and we'll bring you plenty of markets news and some highlights from the rest of our reporting — including, just who can afford to buy property right now ?!",
