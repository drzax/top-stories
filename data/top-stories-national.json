Having already seen a raft of builders collapse during a \"profitless boom\", where surging costs and bad weather wiped out earnings from the construction surge sparked by the pandemic stimulus of HomeBuilder and ultra-low rates, now the industry is facing an historic bust. April's building approvals data shows 11,594 homes were approved for construction last month — that was down 8.1% on the previous month and by almost a quarter (24.1%) on a year earlier. That is the smallest number of new home approvals since April 2012. Both detached houses and units and town houses suffered steep falls. Approvals for standalone houses were down 3.8% month-on-month and 18.6% over the past year, while apartment approvals slumped 16.5% last month and 35.4% year-on-year. Spending on renovations was also down month-on-month. Given that HomeBuilder, by its design, brought forward a lot of building work that ordinarily would have happened over the next few years, it's not surprising that there's now a big hole in the residential development pipeline. There is a silver lining for those construction firms and workers with skills transferrable to the non-residential sector. The value of non-residential building work approved in April was $6.1 billion, and the trend for commercial and infrastructure work was at its highest level on record .",

I'm at a loss on what to watch next 😔 I actually wrote about what to watch after finishing Succession back when season three ended. At the top of my list was The Thick of It. It shares A LOT of the same writers of Succession, mainly Jesse Armstrong but also Tony Roche and Georgia Pritchett. The Thick of It is a dark comedy about the workings of Westminster and centres around the fictional Department of Social Affairs and its incompetent staff. There's a couple other shows on my list which you can check out below, but I would be so interested to see what others recommend!",
