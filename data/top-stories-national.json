              "plaintext": "Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has responded to protests which have popped up in Sydney, where he is set to host talks with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi today. There's been a small protest outside Kirribilli House this morning, and there was a protest outside a major community event featuring both prime ministers last night. Here's some of the exchange which just took place between Albanese and News Breakfast host Michael Rowland: Michael Rowland: [Modi] is accused of repressing his political opponents, the media, he is accused of discriminating against Muslims. Does any of that trouble you? Anthony Albanese: India is of couse the world's largest democracy. Here in Australia, of course people have a right to express their views in a peaceful way and — we all have different views about people in politics. Australia always stands up for human rights, wherever it occurs anywhere in the world. MR: Will you raise those issues with Mr Modi? AA: One of the things that I do is engage with people on a one on one basis. I do that consistently. What I don't do is leak text messages with other world leaders. I have a respectful relationship with Prime Minister Modi and with other leaders. MR: Australia has been at the forefront of condemning outright Russia's illegal invasion of Ukraine. Does it trouble you that Narendra Modi refuses to criticise Russia over the invasion? AA: India is responsible for its own international relations and I respect that. We have very different histories. India has been a leader of the nonaligned movement for such a long period of time. India is a great supporter of peace and security and stability in our region. India participated in not just the G7 meeting that was held on the weekend but of course the Quad leaders meeting is very important in building up that support for security stability, peace and prosperity in our region and the world. At the G20 meeting that will be hosted in India later this year, I am sure, hopefully it will be resolved by then and Russia will recognise its mistake and withdraw before then. If not I expect that there will be a similar statement to which there was at the G20 last year to which India participated.",
