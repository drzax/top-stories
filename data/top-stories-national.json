US officials have revealed further \"underwater noises\" have been detected in the search for a sub still missing in the Atlantic Ocean with five people on board. A Canadian P3 aircraft using sonar buoys yesterday picked up what two US media outlets described as \"banging\" sounds. The Coast Guard in Boston says further noises have been detected today but it's still too early to say whether or not they're connected to the sub. \"When you're in the middle of a search and rescue case, you always have hope. That's why we're doing what we do,\" Captain Jamie Frederick told reporters. \"With respect to the noises specifically, we don't know what they are to be frank with you. \"The P-3 detected noises, that's why they're up there, that's why they're doing what they're doing, that's why they put sonar buoys in the water. \"The good news is we're searching in the area where the noises were detected and we'll continue to do so.\" Captain Frederick said two remotely controlled vehicles (ROVs) are already being used in the search zone and more are on the way.",
