But new analysis from the Commonwealth Bank suggests it's likely we won't see another rate rise. How likely? They're giving it a 90% chance of no change, and a 10% chance of a 0.25 percentage point increase (which would take the cash rate to 4.1%). CBA's head of economics Gareth Aird says there are a couple of reasons behind their thinking: \"Another rate increase would require the economic data, particularly around inflation, GDP, the unemployment rate and wages/unit labour costs, to come in stronger than the RBA's updated forecasts. \"Put another way, we do not think the RBA will lift the cash rate again if the economic data prints in line or weaker than their forecasts from the May Statement on Monetary Policy (SMP). \"Since the May Board meeting the main economic data that will feed into policy deliberations at the June Board meeting has come in slightly weaker than the RBA's latest forecasts. \"The 2023 May Commonwealth Budget has also been handed down since the May Board meeting. And our assessment is that it does not add to inflationary pressures in the economy. \"The run of recent data coupled with our take on the Commonwealth Budget means at this juncture we do not think the June Board meeting is 'live'. \" Of course, this is just a prediction — but CBA was the only one of the big four banks to correctly call the shock rise this month. (And while I'm talking about the RBA, we can expect to hear more about the bank's decisions and thinking when governor Philip Lowe appears at Senate Estimates next Wednesday...)",
