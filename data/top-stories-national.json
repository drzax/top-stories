The IMF slightly upgraded its global growth forecasts in its latest World Economic Outlook, but chief economist Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas says \"yet many challenges still cloud the horizon, and it is too early to celebrate\". Mr Gourinchas says the global economy continues to gradually recover from the pandemic and the signs of progress are undeniable. However, he says interest rate rises by central banks are slowing economies and core inflation remains well above central bank targets. The IMF's World Economic Outlook predicts that global inflation is expected to fall from 8.7 per cent in 2022 to 6.8 per cent in 2023 and 5.2 per cent in 2024. But it said the threat of higher inflation due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine and extreme weather could lead central banks to hike interest rates or cause world leaders to enact more restrictive economic policies. And the IMF warned that China's slow recovery following the reopening of its economy after the pandemic \"shows signs of losing steam\", and a deeper contraction in the real estate sector remained a risk. It left its forecasts for Chinese growth at 5.2 per cent this year and 4.5 per cent in 2024. with AP/Reuters",
