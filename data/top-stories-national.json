To be eligible for the rock hall, artists must have released their first commercial recording at least 25 years before they're eligible for induction. Rock legends Rage Against The Machine have released a statement about their long road to the rock hall, after being eligible for the past five years."

                  "articleBody": "Donald Trump's lawyers say they won't call any witnesses at the New York civil trial about writer E. Jean Carroll's claims that the former US president raped her in the mid-1990s. Trump lawyer Joseph Tacopina said they decided not to put on a defence case after learning that health issues were preventing their expert witness, a psychiatrist, from testifying. Tacopina had previously said that Trump would not testify at the trial himself. Carroll's lawyers say they could finish presenting their case on Thursday. They listed five remaining witnesses, including a former People magazine writer who says Trump pinned her against a wall and forcibly kissed her at his Mar-a-Lago mansion in Florida in 2005 — an allegation he denies. They also plan on playing excerpts of a sworn deposition that Trump gave in connection with Carroll's lawsuit, as well as a the 2005 Access Hollywood tape in which Trump boasted about grabbing women's genitals. Trump denies ever touching women against their will and has said that Carroll's claims are politically motivated attempts to smear his reputation and deny him a return to the White House. His lawyers have attacked Carroll's credibility through cross-examination, questioning why she didn't scream out for help during the alleged attack and why she never went to police. Reporting by AP"

Jean Carroll's claims that the former US president raped her in the mid-1990s. Trump lawyer Joseph Tacopina said they decided not to put on a defence case after learning that health issues were preventing their expert witness, a psychiatrist, from testifying. Tacopina had previously said that Trump would not testify at the trial himself. Carroll's lawyers say they could finish presenting their case on Thursday. They listed five remaining witnesses, including a former People magazine writer who says Trump pinned her against a wall and forcibly kissed her at his Mar-a-Lago mansion in Florida in 2005 — an allegation he denies. They also plan on playing excerpts of a sworn deposition that Trump gave in connection with Carroll's lawsuit, as well as a the 2005 Access Hollywood tape in which Trump boasted about grabbing women's genitals. Trump denies ever touching women against their will and has said that Carroll's claims are politically motivated attempts to smear his reputation and deny him a return to the White House. His lawyers have attacked Carroll's credibility through cross-examination, questioning why she didn't scream out for help during the alleged attack and why she never went to police. Reporting by AP",

To be eligible for the rock hall, artists must have released their first commercial recording at least 25 years before they're eligible for induction. Rock legends Rage Against The Machine have released a statement about their long road to the rock hall, after being eligible for the past five years.",

Jean Carroll's claims that the former US president raped her in the mid-1990s. Trump lawyer Joseph Tacopina said they decided not to put on a defence case after learning that health issues were preventing their expert witness, a psychiatrist, from testifying. Tacopina had previously said that Trump would not testify at the trial himself. Carroll's lawyers say they could finish presenting their case on Thursday. They listed five remaining witnesses, including a former People magazine writer who says Trump pinned her against a wall and forcibly kissed her at his Mar-a-Lago mansion in Florida in 2005 — an allegation he denies. They also plan on playing excerpts of a sworn deposition that Trump gave in connection with Carroll's lawsuit, as well as a the 2005 Access Hollywood tape in which Trump boasted about grabbing women's genitals. Trump denies ever touching women against their will and has said that Carroll's claims are politically motivated attempts to smear his reputation and deny him a return to the White House. His lawyers have attacked Carroll's credibility through cross-examination, questioning why she didn't scream out for help during the alleged attack and why she never went to police. Reporting by AP",
