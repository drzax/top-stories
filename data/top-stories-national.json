              "plaintext": "Left-of-centre think tank The Australia Institute is hosting a revenue summit in Canberra today. Unsurprisingly, given the hosts, the key theme of the summit was the urgent need to raise more revenue to pay for government services. Probably the most interesting speaker was former finance department boss Michael Keating (no relation to former PM Paul). He says Australia needs to dramatically increase its tax take, rather than cut it (as will happen when the already legislated stage three income tax cuts take effect next July). \"Even if Australia increased its taxation revenue by as much as another 4% of GDP, as I've suggested is needed, I contend that that would not harm economic growth. \"Taxation in Australia would still only be raising about the same amount of revenue relative to GDP as the OECD average, and Australian taxation would still be lower than in Canada and the UK.\" And here's how he thinks it could be done. \"First: a high priority would be to rely more on those taxes which improve efficiency, such as a carbon tax, congestion charging and substituting a land tax for stamp duty. \"Second: Australia raises relatively little from its GST compared to other countries. [It] would be possible and arguably desirable to raise more by a combination of broadening the GST tax base and raising the GST tax rate. \"Third: resource rent tax. So the community shares some of the super profits that mining companies can make due to fortuitous circumstances not from their own effort or initiative. \"Fourth: the avoidance of company tax has become an industry. As I said, I'm not an expert, but urge close consideration of Ross Garner's proposal to substitute a tax on corporate cash flows for the present company tax. \"Fifth: loopholes in the personal income tax system, such as inadequate rate of capital gains taxation and negative gearing should similarly be closed. \"Sixth, and finally, we need more progressive income tax rates. The starting point should be to at least adjust the stage three tax cuts .\" If you don't know what the stage three tax cuts are, I did a handy primer video earlier this year with Angelique Lu. That last proposal also got support from independent MPs Monique Ryan and Dai Le. \"For the government, they really can't go ahead with it, shouldn't go ahead with it,\" said Dai Le, the member for Fowler, a traditionally Labor electorate in south-west Sydney. \"And think about it, especially for a Labor government by the way. Labor is supposed to be for the working Australians, right?\" Ms Ryan, who defeated previous treasurer Josh Frydenberg in the wealthy Melbourne electorate of Kooyong, may not be popular with some of her high-income constituents for also backing the wind-back of stage three. \"The 2019 stage three tax cuts were a booby trap for our economy,\" she argued. \"Led by Malcolm Turnbull, and by Scott Morrison and Josh Frydenberg, they were the wrong policy at the wrong time then, and worse now. \"They will be inflationary, they'll suck revenue out of a tax system at a time when we need more revenue to set up … a country for the future to drive our transition to a new clean energy economy and to find the revenue that we need for aged care, child care, disability care and medical care. \"This at a time when debt costs cost us more to service our debt than we have for a long, long time.\" Her suggestion? To retain the 37% tax rate on each dollar earned between $120,001-200,000, which is being abolished as part of stage three. I went down to Canberra to cover last year's event, and that was one of the key suggestions put forward by some of the tax experts I spoke to then.",

This ABS measure was up 1.8% for the quarter and 3.8% over the past year. While the annual figure isn't too far above the top of the RBA's 2-3% target for inflation, the reacceleration of the quarterly number would be a concern. As you can see, it's the second-highest in recent years. Basically, this measures the input costs for businesses across the economy, and as those costs go up, businesses can either pass them on to customers or absorb them via lower profits. You don't have to be a genius to guess which option businesses prefer. Rabobank's global strategists see it as yet another reason for the Reserve Bank board to hike interest rates (at least) once more. \"This adds to the case for the RBA to resume its hiking cycle at the November meeting, where we expect a 25bps lift in the cash rate to 4.35%.\" Of course, if the increases in interest rates are already working to reduce consumer demand, then many companies may struggle to pass their costs on without losing a lot of sales. So a higher PPI may mean lower profits as much as it signals higher consumer prices. This is what drove the big jump in business costs. \"Higher prices for construction outputs, petroleum and energy were compounded by broad-based price increases in services, particularly health and childcare services,\" the ABS noted. \"New financial year contract negotiations, indexation clauses, annual wage cost reviews and increasing operating costs contributed to price rises across services industries.\" So, therein lies the good news. The producer price index is not seasonally adjusted, and an awful lot of price adjustments take effect on July 1 each year (the start of the September quarter). Another interesting thing to note is that while construction output costs rose, for the first time in a long time the cost of building materials didn't. \" The cost of house building materials was unchanged in the September Quarter 2023, for the first time since before the pandemic,\" stated HIA Senior Economist Tom Devitt. \"This sees the cost of house building materials just 4.4 per cent higher over the year, compared to a 17.3 per cent annual increase in 2021/22. \"The slowing in cost of house building inputs reflects a significant easing in the materials constraints that plagued the industry during the pandemic. \"Some of the worst-affected products during the pandemic are now seeing outright declines in price. \"Last year, structural timber and reinforcing steel prices were both up by more than 60 per cent on pre-pandemic levels. In the last year, they have declined by 8.8 per cent and 5.3 per cent respectively. Steel beams and sections, which were up by more than 50 per cent a year ago, subsequently declined by 17.2 per cent.\" But it's clearly going to take a while for that to feed through into cheaper new home builds and renovations, if it ever does.",

The first is the bank's \"Wellbeing Index\", which rose very slightly in the September quarter, albeit from a two-year low. It is still below average levels, with anxiety on the rise but measures of financial stress falling for the first time in six quarters. \"Though Australians are clearly being stretched financially, many appear to be growing more accustomed to these pressures, having made deliberate spending trade-offs to manage household balance sheets and support their lifestyle in the face of inflation and higher rates,\" the report noted. For the month of September, these trade-offs don't appear to have included a massive reduction in retail spending. NAB's monthly online retail sales index rebounded with a 2.9% jump in September after a 1.1% fall in August, with online retail spending now up 11% over the year to September. Of course, inflation has accounted for about half of that growth, with average consumer prices up 5.4% over that same period. Nonetheless, NAB's chief economist Alan Oster says it's another indication of Australians' overall financial resilience in the face of big interest rate hikes. \"The growth for the largest sales category, homewares and appliances, was enough to lift year-on-year growth back to positive territory, which had been negative for over a year,\" he said. \"For the broader online series, and other categories, the improvement in year-on-year growth has been underway since May.\" But NAB's wellbeing survey again highlights that some groups are feeling the financial strain a lot more than others. \"Around 6 in 10 (57%) Australians identified living costs as the biggest cause of their stress (down slightly from 61% in Q2), still well ahead of personal financial issues, health (both physical and mental), housing costs and the economy. \"Concerns around living and housing costs are most pronounced for Australians aged 30-49 and those on lower incomes.\"",
