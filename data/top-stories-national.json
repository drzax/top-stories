The Reserve Bank has passed through four percentage points worth of rate hikes since May last year in a bid to curb sky-high inflation. That's starting to have an effect, with monthly inflation figures released last week showing another bigger-than-forecast decline to 4.9 per cent, down from 5.4 per cent in June. Most economists say this means it's likely the RBA will keep interest rates at 4.1 per cent for a third straight month. It marks the final meeting for outgoing governor Philip Lowe, who hands over to Michele Bullock later this month.",
