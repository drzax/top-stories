Security camera footage released by police, from the southern town of Berat, shows two men starting a fire. They have also been identified and arrested. \"The fire has reached a massive area of pine trees near the town of Lac and this is one of the worst wildfires this year,\" Interior Minister Taulant Balla said on social media. Local media showed video of an army helicopter pouring water in the area as a flames could be seen close to houses. Defence Minister Niko Peleshi says 50 soldiers were deployed but stopping the fire remained a challenge due to difficult terrain. In July alone, Albania identified and charged 14 people with starting wildfires, which is punishable with up to 15 years in jail. Wildfires are also raging in Greece, Spain, Italy and Portugal, as the region suffers hot, dry and windy conditions that scientists have linked to climate change.",

But Domino's Pizza has pledged to not to pass on price increases this year after customers ordered fewer pizzas because of the higher cost. The firm says that the company's margins and earnings were affected by the decision to increase menu prices amid \"extraordinary inflation\". Net profit for 2023 fell by three-quarters. Domino's says it raised prices because of high levels of inflation including food, labour and energy — the same pressures that all businesses are facing. Managing director Don Meij conceded that some customers did not like the introduction of a delivery service fee and over time and they ordered less frequently. \"I want to be clear to our customers facing cost of living pressures, we do not expect to pass on pricing increases this year.\" \"We encourage customers who haven't ordered recently, or who haven't tried us before, to put us to the test and see what great value Domino's delivers.\" Here's a quick look at the bottom line for 2023: Group revenue: +3.5 per cent to $2.35 billion EBIT: -23.3 per cent to $201.7 million Net profit: -74.4 per cent to $40.6 million Final dividend: 42.6 cents a share unfranked from 68.1 cents last year 2024 outlook: Domino's says it seeing strong sales growth so far this financial year in Europe, Australia and New Zealand.",
