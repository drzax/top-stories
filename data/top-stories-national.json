For integrated property groups such as Goodman Group, who own, develop, and manage properties, raising funds in an environment of rising interest rates can be a challenge, as is raising rents and increasing profits. \"For owners of shopping centres, such as Stockland Group who have retailers as tenants - in the current environment of soft trading updates, retailers simply cannot afford to pay higher rent. \"Furthermore, presuming the current consumer slowdown continues and costs increase (higher wages), retailers’ earnings will likely continue to fall and will soon result in profit warnings and eventually requests for rent reductions. \"All of which is a direct result of the impact of higher interest rates. As noted above, when taming inflation is the priority, nothing else matters.\" He's included this chart to show the Property Sector index has performed since the start of 2022.",
