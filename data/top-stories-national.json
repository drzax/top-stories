The Gaza Strip has been cut off from food, water and fuel supplies coming through Israel, with electricity also cut and several health facilities damaged in air strikes. \"We have seen devastating loss of innocent life since the heinous attacks on Israel by brutal terrorist group Hamas,\" Foreign Minister Penny Wong said. \"Far from representing the Palestinian people, Hamas undermines Palestinian needs and aspirations. \"We continue to call for the unconditional release of all hostages. We stand with Israel and reiterate its right to defend itself. \"President Biden has called on Israel to operate by the rules of war in its response to Hamas attacks — we join him and others in that call. \"We call for safe and unimpeded humanitarian access to civilians affected by the worsening humanitarian crisis in Gaza. \"We call for the establishment of a corridor to enable humanitarian needs to be met.
