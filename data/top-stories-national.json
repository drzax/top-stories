Victoria announced last week that all new residential properties and subdivisions which require a planning permit will only be powered by electricity from January 1. While NSW had been on the fence over the weekend, the premier has drawn a line through a similar gas ban this morning, AAP reports. \"We're not pursuing that,\" he tells 2GB. The premier's call came a day after NSW Energy Minister Penny Sharpe said her office was still contemplating a gas ban. \"We're not ruling it out all together but I've got to say it's not a priority,\" she told reporters on Sunday.",

The local currency had risen 0.4% to 66.74 US cents by 1:10pm AEST. But the Australian share market erased most of its early gains, with the ASX 200 flat at 7,406 points. China's manufacturing activity shrank for a fourth straight month in July (albeit at a slower pace), according to results of a factory survey published today by the country's National Bureau of Statistics. The official purchasing managers' index ( PMI ) was at 49.3 points this month (a slight improvement over the 49-point reading it scored in June). Any score below 50-points means the industry is contracting (while a score above 50 mean it's expanding). The world's second-largest economy grew at a slow pace in the June quarter, as demand remained weak at home and abroad, leading the Politburo - a top decision-making body of the ruling Communist Party - to describe economic recovery as \"tortuous\". Despite that, it was a strong day for Asian stock markets with the Nikkei, Shanghai Composite and Hang Seng rising by 1.5%, 0.6% and 1.5% respectively.",

The RBA is expected to lift rates once more by 0.25 percentage points on Tuesday, and pause for the rest of the year as inflation is still running well above the target, according to a slim majority of economists in a Reuters poll. Here's what Reuters is saying: Although the RBA has raised rates by a total of 400 basis points since May 2022, inflation was still running at 6% in the last quarter (double the upper end of the 2-3% target range). A record low unemployment rate and a rebound in house prices in Australia - one of the world's most expensive housing markets - suggests the RBA still needs to raise base borrowing costs. Most global central banks are inching closer to the end of an historic tightening campaign, including the US Federal Reserve, and economists also expect the RBA will be done soon. Thirty-six economists were surveyed by Reuters, in a poll taken on July 26-28. Over 55% of those economists forecast the RBA to raise its official cash rate by 25 basis points to 4.35%, the highest in nearly 12 years, at its August 1 meeting. The remaining 45% expected no change to the cash rate target. But financial markets were pricing in only a one in five chance of that happening. Among major local banks, Commonwealth Bank and Westpac expected a 25 basis points hike tomorrow, while ANZ and NAB predicted a pause.",
