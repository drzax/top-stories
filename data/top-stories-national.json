There’s been no real indication from the prosecution about if and when that will happen. But given the indictment essentially accuses the “co-conspirators” of serious criminal behaviour, a lot of people are asking why they haven’t been charged. Some legal experts think it could be that the prosecutor wants to speed things up ahead of next year’s election. Indicting seven people, instead of one, would make things far more complex and inevitably slow down the court process. Others think the threat of charges could encourage the “co-conspirators” to try to strike a deal with prosecutors. That could mean co-operating with them in their efforts to prosecute Trump. That’s a long shot, though, given these people have stayed so loyal to Trump so far. Some have explicitly said they will remain so. For example, a lawyer for John Eastman, who is believed to be “Co-conspirator 2”, has put out a statement saying his client was not involved in any plea bargaining and “if Dr Eastman is indicted, he will go to trial”.",

Ms Lambert is the third person charged in Michigan this week after a special prosecutor in that state reviewed allegations that Trump allies illegally accessed voting machines after the 2020 election. Two other Republicans, former Michigan attorney general candidate Matt DePerno, and Daire Rendon, a former state representative, made their initial court appearances on Tuesday in connection with the case.

ANZ shares are up 0.6 per cent in early trade. Boss Shayne Elliott said ANZ is \"naturally disappointed and disagree with the ACCC's decision\". \"We believe the acquisition will improve competition, which will benefit Australian consumers, particularly in Queensland,\" Mr Elliott said in the ASX statement. ANZ also noted that decisions by the ACCC could be reviewed by the Australian Competition Tribunal. And in the meantime, it \"continues its preparations for the integration of Suncorp Bank into ANZ\". Meanwhile, Suncorp shares are now down 1.9 per cent after the news. Suncorp chair Christine McLoughlin says the bank is \"surprised and disappointed\" and would \"fully support\" ANZ if it referred the decision to the Australian Competition Tribunal. \"…we believe the Tribunal will accept the merits of our case,\" she said. Federal Treasurer Jim Chalmers has also noted the decision, saying the government \"respects the independence of the ACCC and does not intend to comment further on the decision or the future of the proposal\", but noted that there is the option for the banks to take the decision to the Tribunal or Federal Court.

In his opening statement, he's made clear he doesn't see a conflict of interest, despite the two sharing text messages. \"Mr Fuller and I have a collegial, professional relationship. I describe him as a friend, and like I said in May, I consider all current and former Police Commissioners friends. My familiarity with Mr Fuller is from years of working together - including through the COVID pandemic – but it is not from socialising together. Mr Fuller and I do not have dinner at each other’s homes. We don’t play golf together. I don’t know the personal details of his life. I want to be clear about that because it is important that our professional relationship is not mischaracterised. The majority of the conversations Mr Fuller and I have are about matters relating to our former or current roles, or policing issues in general. What we have in common is dedication to service, to the community and keeping our people safe.\" Greens Senator David Shoebridge put to Commissioner Kershaw that he was involved in the early stages of the contracting process, before it was decided to award it to PwC. DS: Now you attended a meeting on the 28th of July 2022. Where you, (other staff) Mick Fuller in his position as PwC partner and other members of the PwC team... and the purpose of the meeting was said to be an introductory meeting to outline the identified need to undertake a comprehensive independent review of the AFPs delivery of policing services to the ACT government' and then this informed PwC is consideration of whether they had the capability to undertake the work and would submit a formal quote, you say that? RK: Yes. DS: Is that an accurate reflection of the meeting from your memory? RK: It was important to understand that they had had the capability to undertake that work given the importance of ACT policing, in particular challenges that they have been facing. like a lot of police forces across Australia (answer goes on). DS: Commissioner, you were in the pre contract meeting with PwC when there was a pre contract meeting, and you were there, working through with them, whether or not they got the contract? RK: I was understanding whether they had the capability. I was there, yes. The hearing continues.",

The decision is another blow for the Commonwealth Games Federation (CGF) after the Canadian city of Hamilton (which hosted the inaugural Games in 1930) suspended its bid and Australia's Victorian government last month withdrew as host of the 2026 Games due to projected cost overruns. The Alberta bid was scuttled for similar reasons, Reuters reports. \"We promised to remain transparent with Albertans about the costs of hosting international sporting events and clearly demonstrating a return on our investment for the people and communities of Alberta,\" wrote Mackenzie Blyth, press secretary to the Minister of Tourism and Sports Joseph Schow in an email to CBC. \"In the case of the 2030 Commonwealth Games, the numbers just didn't add up for our government to commit taxpayer's money with the games estimated to cost $CA2.68 billion ($3.1 billion).\"",
