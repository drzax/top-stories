Research by property marketplace Domain suggests Australia's housing market will have recovered from the 2022 downturn in the coming financial year, with some capital cities to see new record high house and unit prices. The Domain Forecast Report expects house prices in Sydney, Adelaide and Perth will reach a new record high, while unit prices will jump in Brisbane, Adelaide and Hobart. Here's a quick rundown of how much house prices are expected to rise in the capitals: Sydney: 6-9% Melbourne: 0-2% Brisbane: 1-4% Perth: 1-3% Adelaide: 2-5% Hobart: 3-5% Canberra: 2-4% Domain's chief of research and economics, Nicola Powell, says strong demand is responsible for the higher prices in the near future. \"Population pressures will lead the charge in factors driving housing demand and property prices higher over the next 12 months,\" she said. \"Australia has seen an exponential increase in temporary and permanent migration since the international border reopened in late 2021 to alleviate skills shortages. \"Of course, unlike natural population growth, those arriving from overseas aren’t already housed. \"This puts us in a position where in the next financial year alone, nearly 130,000 extra dwellings will be needed, with the Eastern Seaboard receiving the largest share of migrants.\"",

Not only have we gotten through the shortest day of the year overnight (shoutout to the winter solstice) but we've had an interesting night on the global financial front, too. Let's get the big news out of the way first — the UK's latest inflation figures have been released, which has pretty much guaranteed that the Bank of England is going to raise rates at its meeting tonight. Inflation in the UK remained unchanged at 8.7%, surprising forecasters who had expected a small drop to 8.4%. But the UK's core (or underlying) inflation figure has risen to 7.1%, up from 6.8% — making it the highest rate since 1992. As for what economists are predicting the BoE to do tonight? Another hike of 0.25 percentage points is all but certain. Across the Atlantic, and the US Federal Reserve chair has used his appearance at a House Financial Committee hearing to reiterate the FOMC's comments last week — that more monetary tightening (aka interest rate rises) are on the way. Jerome Powell said additional hikes of 0.5 percentage points are \"a pretty good guess\", saying there are likely two more rate increases of 0.25 percentage points by the end of the year. Somewhat unsurprisingly, US markets finished lower, while the US dollar fell around half a percent in response. Back home and Wall Street's slower finish looks set to translate on the local markets, with futures slightly down this morning. It's early days, but grab a coffee and let's see how the day transpires, shall we?",
