That includes a $53 million provision which accounts for costs associated with the cyber incident, including remediation costs. That figure however doesn't account for regulatory fines, potential class actions, future system changes or assumed insurance proceeds. Latitude is now expecting a profit between $ 15 million and $25 million. The company also says it has contacted all affected customers (past and present) impacted by the data breach, and there has been no suspicious activity in its systems since March 16. The incident is also under investigation by the AFP, and Latitude says they're cooperating fully with the OAIC. Latitude also says their regular business operations are now back online after around \"five weeks\" of delays. (Sidenote, but if you're a Latitude customer and want to get in touch, I've done stories in the past couple of months on the breach. Feel free to send me an email at ainsworth.kate@abc.net.au or you can use the comment button above â I won't share them on the blog.)",

After a short recess she has held off, pending legal advice. \"Thank you to all here for their thoughtful consideration of this matter,\" she said at its resumption. \"I believe there's a strong public interest in those names of those involved in recent events in PwC being in the public realm, but I accept the decision and respect the decision that we've just made as a committee that we will seek the advice of the clerk and proceed accordingly. \" I believe that the truth and the names of people involved in this event will [come] out and I think that's it's important the Australian public have that knowledge sooner rather than later. Thank you.\" Treasury has referred the former head of international tax at PwC Peter-John Collins to the Australian Federal Police for consideration of a criminal decision.
