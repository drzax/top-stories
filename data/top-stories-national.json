New Zealand had chance after chance, and even found the back of the net in the 70th minute only for VAR to find the tightest of offside calls. They had other chances, with Hannah Wilkinson heading over the bar and Jacqui Hand hitting the woodwork, and then the injury-time volley from Grace Jale that was expertly kept out by Olivia McDaniel.",
