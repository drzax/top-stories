In a statement earlier today, Australian Federal Police said they were investigating the threats against Senator Thorpe, but would not discuss the protection arrangements in place for individuals.

Some of that fire activity continues and now in the later end of the week they are working on the flood response,\" she said. She said after flood levels peak, which is expected to occur around midday, teams would be better placed to assess any damage. \"Teams will then be able to go in and assess the level of inundation, particularly in homes,\" she said. \"They've not been able to get in and do that assessment yet because the floodwaters continue to rise and a number of roads remain closed in the local community.\" The premier said the release of water at Lake Glenmaggie and Lake Eildon had been discussed at an emergency meeting last night. She said nine people had spent the night at the relief centre at Sale, and that that personal hardship payments were available for those affected by the floods. \"I want to thank local communities and local residents for heeding the warnings and making their decisions early as to how they can make themselves and their families safe in this emergency situation,\" Ms Allan said.",

Newry dairy farmer Steve Dwyer, whose property is impacted by the floods, told ABC Victorian Mornings that the peak water body should have released water from the Glenmaggie Weir earlier. “No attempt was made to drop the level of the ‘Maggie’ weir,” he says. The ABC understands water releases from Lake Glenmaggie reached 58,000 megalitres overnight. Southern Rural Water has defended its actions, stating it worked to the information available at the time. “We ran models before the events over the last couple of days and those models were based on the high end of the rainfall range in this catchment,” managing director Cameron Fitzgerald says. “The models aren't wrong, we use the best available information that we have. “And then of course, there are variations in what actually happens, where the rain falls in the particular catchment, and how that flows. He stopped short of apologising to residents, stating welfare’s been at the forefront of all decisions. “We have managed the dam in a way that has taken the peak off this flood,” Mr Fitzgerald says. “Unquestionably the dam being there has reduced the amount of flooding downstream.”",

The median weekly rent has gone up by 30.4 per cent in just three years, with people paying $137 more a week on average now than in July 2020. CoreLogic economist Eliza Owen says there is a shortfall of rental listings at a time when people are once again migrating to Australia in big numbers. \"You've got real volatility with the private rental market and with the more vulnerable lower-income households.\" My colleague Emilia Terzon has written more about this, so I've linked it below. It has a really nifty interactive chart created by colleague Kate Ainsworth showing the least and most adorable suburbs to rent in Australia. It's a bit sobering.",
