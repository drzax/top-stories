This brings the total of people helped out of Gaza by the Australian government to 25. Yesterday it confirmed 20 Australians safely fled the strip, as well as a permanent resident and two family members. It is not known whether the two who left in the past 24 hours are citizens. A DFAT spokesperson told the ABC it was still assisting 64 individuals in Gaza, composed of Australians and their families, who have requested help to depart. \"We continue to engage closely with partners in the region to ensure the remaining Australians in Gaza who wish to leave are able to do so as soon as possible,\" they said. \"Departures depend on a range of factors, and the situation in Gaza remains highlight challenging and can change rapidly. \"Overnight, a further four Australians and one family member also departed the West Bank for Jordan.\" Australians in need of emergency consular assistance should contact the Australian Government’s 24-hour Consular Emergency Centre on +61 2 6261 3305 (from overseas) or 1300 555 135 (from within Australia).",
