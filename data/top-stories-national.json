Figures from Roy Morgan reveal 1.5 million, or 29 per cent, of borrowers were at risk of mortgage stress in July 2023 — a number higher than during the global financial crisis. While the percentage of affected people is lower than in 2008, the number of Australians at risk is higher due to growth in the population and the number of people in the mortgage market. The report also shows the number of borrowers battling to pay off loans has steadily risen since the RBA began its aggressive run of interest rate rises in May last year. It comes ahead of a speech from incoming Reserve Bank governor Michelle Bullock, who will speak in Canberra tomorrow evening before she takes up the job mid-next month.

And with ASX futures pointing higher, it could be a good start to the week for the local share market in just over an hour's time. It follows US markets ending higher on Friday, as traders digested comments from Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell at a central banker summit. Speaking at the annual Jackson Hole Economic Policy Symposium in Wyoming, Mr Powell indicating that while US interest rates may need to rise further, the Fed would proceed with caution. \"We will proceed carefully as we decide whether to tighten further or, instead, to hold the policy rate constant and await further data,\" he said. \"It is the Fed’s job to bring inflation down to our 2 per cent goal, and we will do so.\" On the local front, reporting season continues with results from companies including Fortescue due today. The ABS will release retail sales figures for July mid-morning — so stick around through the day for all the latest!",
