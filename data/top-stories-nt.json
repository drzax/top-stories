              "plaintext": "So this is where inflation's now sitting. The annual rate of headline inflation fell to 6 per cent in the June quarter, down from 7 per recent in the March quarter. It's the second consecutive quarter of lower annual inflation. This is known as \" disinflation\". Market economists were expecting the headline rate of annual inflation to fall to 6.2 per cent, so it's lower than they were anticipating. And what about underlying inflation? The Reserve Bank is particularly interested in underlying inflation, because that shows us what's happening to inflation when volatile price movements are stripped out of the headline figure. The ABS refers to underlying inflation as \"trimmed mean\" inflation. And it has fallen to 5.9 per cent in the June quarter, down from 6.6 per cent in the March quarter, and the peak in December 2022 of 6.9 per cent. When the RBA talks about wanting to get inflation back down into its 2-3% target range, it's talking about underlying/trimmed mean inflation. So it's heading back towards target.",

That's a pull back from a 1.4 per cent rise over the March quarter and a 7 per cent increase over the year to March driven by gas and domestic travel.
