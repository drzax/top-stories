The Kiwi central bank unveils its latest policy decision at 12pm AEST and is forecast to keep rates on hold but that doesn't mean the pain is over for home owners. Economists at the Commonwealth Bank's NZ arm ASB expect the cash rate, which has been at its current level since May, to now remain on hold until mid-next year, when it is tipping cuts to begin. However, CBA senior economist Kristina Clifton notes, \"there is still plenty of monetary tightening to filter through to the NZ economy\". \"Around 90 per cent of mortgages in NZ are taken at fixed rates. \"Fixed rate mortgages shelter the borrower from interest rate increases until the fixed term expires,\" Ms Clifton writes. \"The effective interest rate on outstanding mortgages has risen, but at just over 5 per cent, it is still below the RBNZ’s official cash rate.\" Take a look at this chart: That's what you can see on the red line above — it's still below the official cash rate. By comparison, the yellow line, showing new fixed loan rates, is much higher. So as people roll off the rates indicated by the red line, they'll be facing a jump up to the yellow or green lines on the chart. \"As more fixed rate loans expire and roll on to much higher fixed or variable interest rates household spending is likely to slow and reduce the pressure on inflation,\" Ms Clifton says. So while the RBNZ might not raise any further, NZ borrowers are unlikely to feel rates relief for some time.",

And it looks like the ASX will follow, with futures down more than 1 per cent. Behind the negativity? Some stronger-than-expected data out of the US, showing retail sales increased by 0.7 per cent in July, raised concerns that the Federal Reserve may need to hike interest rates further to tame inflation. Meanwhile, worries about China's economic health weighed on oil prices, with Brent crude down more than 1 per cent, despite surprise rate cuts from Beijing yesterday. Locally, reporting season rolls on, with quite a few results today: Transurban Dexus Endeavour Group Mirvac Bapcor Seven West Media And at midday AEST, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand will deliver its latest interest rate decision, with the cash rate tipped to stay on hold at 5.5 per cent. Stick with us for all the latest through the session!",
