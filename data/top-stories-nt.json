Netherland goalkeeper Daphne van Domselaar has been brilliant. The good news for the Dutch, it's 0-0. They have been dominated, but have not looked completely overwhelmed. A chance to regroup and see what they can offer in the second half. One thing I'd like to see a bit more from Spain is Bonmati in attacking positions.

Jean Carroll defamed him by accusing him of rape, after a jury awarded her $US5 million for defamation and sexual abuse but not rape. The former president has asked the federal appeals court in Manhattan to overturn an August 7 decision by US District Judge Lewis Kaplan that also rejected some of his defences in a second defamation lawsuit by Ms Carroll. Both cases stemmed from Mr Trump's denials that he raped Carroll in a Bergdorf Goodman department store dressing room in Manhattan in the mid-1990s. A trial in the second lawsuit is scheduled for January 15, 2024, but Mr Trump wants it put on hold during his separate appeal against Judge Kaplan's June 29 refusal to dismiss it. Ms Carroll's lawyers opposed that request, saying she had waited long enough, and the public would be \"poorly served\" by granting Mr Trump an \"effectively indefinite delay\".",
