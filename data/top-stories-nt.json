The government has ramped up scrutiny of the gas industry, introducing price caps and proposing to expand powers to curb liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports from east coast plants to ensure sufficient supply for domestic consumers at affordable prices. Gas producers, however, have said the measures would deter investment in new supply crucial for the east coast, home to most of the country's population and gas-dependent manufacturers. The objective of the government's intervention is to have enough supply for east coast markets at a reasonable price, Anna Brakey, commissioner of the Australian Competition & Consumer Commission (ACCC), told the APPEA industry conference. \"We will now turn our focus to retailers,\" she said. Retailers are expected to pass on cheaper gas prices to consumers and if this does not happen, it will provide further recommendations to the government, Ms Brakey said. The country's top gas retailers are Origin Energy, AGL Energy and EnergyAustralia (owned by Hong Kong's CLP Holdings). \"What we really want to see is a thriving market that can serve both the domestic and international market commitments,\" she said. \"We are projecting a (gas supply) shortfall from 2027, (but) we do hope that new supply will come in to fill that gap.\" In a January report, the ACCC said forecast gas production is insufficient to meet forecast demand in the east coast from 2027.",

The local currency fell after the latest economic data from key trading partner China fell short of analysts' forecasts, adding to evidence of a sputtering COVID recovery. China's industrial output grew 5.6% in April (from a year earlier), according to official data. This missed expectations by a large margin, as economists were expecting a 10.9% increase. But it was still the quicket growth since September 2022, largely due to the recoil effect from the contraction suffered last April when the commercial hub Shanghai was under stringent COVID lockdown. Meanwhile, China's retail sales jumped 18.4% (missing forecasts for a 21% increase). But it was still much faster retail growth, comapred to the 10.6% increase in March. Fixed asset investment expanded 4.7% in the first four months of 2023 (from the same period a year earlier). Again, it missed analysts' expectations for a 5.5% rise.",
