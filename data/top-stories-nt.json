He said he has been shocked at the \"bizarre\" and \"nutty\" conspiracy theories surrounding the ballot. \"We run one of the most transparent voting systems in the world,\" he said. \"A hundred thousand members of the community, who are the eyes and the ears of the community — thousands of scrutineers who watch everything that we do. \"And please, if you've got a question ask a member of the AEC – don't believe that nonsense online.\" Mr Rodgers said whether the result of the referendum is known tonight will depend on how close the outcome is. \"If there is a very large margin, we'll know the results of that this evening,\" he said. \"[But] we've had something like 2 million postal vote applications – those votes have to come back before we can count them.\" Lines have formed outside polling booths across Canberra this morning, with two thirds of Canberrans expected to cast their votes in person today. About 119,000 Canberrans – or just over a third – have already pre-polled, in addition to the 25,000 that applied for a postal vote.",
