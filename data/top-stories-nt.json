Those include Peter Konidaris, Eddy Moussa, Richard Gregg, Pete Calleja, Sean Gregory, Peter van Dongen, Wayne Plummer and Tom Seymour — PwC Australia's CEO, who was replaced by acting CEO Kristin Stubbins in the wake of the scandal. Their exits are in addition to the former four partners, who have previously been named as Michael Bersten, Peter Collins, Neil Fuller, and Paul McNab. PwC says the investigation found a number of specific examples where professional standards were breached, regarding the misuse of confidential information or other matters reviewed by the ATO. \"Furthermore, the investigation identified a failure of leadership and governance to adequately address the matters, either at the time or whilst the matters were under investigation by the TPB or ATO. This enabled poor behaviours to persist with no accountability. These behaviours are not, and never have been, acceptable under PwC’s standards,\" the firm said in a statement.",

A media release put out by Telstra this morning says the agreement will help provide connectivity options to people and businesses who live in areas where it's difficult to connect with existing networks. \"Our network currently uses a mix of technologies to provide voice and broadband services in rural and remote Australia, including NBN fixed broadband, our mobile network and older copper and radio networks,\" it said. \"The addition of Starlink will provide an additional connectivity option for people and businesses in rural and remote locations where distance and terrain make it difficult to provide quality connectivity with existing terrestrial networks. \"We truly believe in improving connectivity for all Australians, regardless of where you live work and play. Adding LEO [Low Earth Orbit] satellites as an option both for customers and to bolster our connectivity options in regional areas brings us a big leap closer to closing this digital divide.\" The service is expected to launch sometime in late 2023, with pricing still to be confirmed.",
