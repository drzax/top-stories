With only a few hours of trade left, it's looking increasingly likely the local share market will finish roughly where it started this week. A continued slide in tech stocks is a big driver behind the ASX's dip, with the technology sector down 1.1%, and the academic and educational, industrials and financial sectors each down 0.7%. Consumer non-cyclicals are up 1.1% though, while energy has gained 0.6%. As for the top movers: Ingenia Communities +4.1% Coronado Global Resources: +2.8% Endeavour Group +2% Whitehaven Coal +1.95 Treasury Wine +1.8% At the other end, miners are among the worst performers: Mineral Resources -6.9% Lake Resources -5.5% Newcrest Mining -5.2% Syrah Resources -5.1% Imugene -5%",

CBA, Westpac and ANZ have all lifted their fixed rates in the last 10 days, and now with NAB following suit, there are no longer any fixed rates from the big four banks under 6%. Here's how today's changes from NAB affect the lowest fixed rates it offers for owner-occupiers paying principal and interest: For reference, here's the lowest advertised fixed rates with the big four banks now, per RateCity.com.au: So why the rise? Is it because of the RBA's past rate hike? Here's RateCity.com.au 's research director Sally Tindall 's take: \"Pressure on profit margins is likely to be the key motivator behind these fixed rates increases. Conveniently, a lack of interest in fixing from borrowers gives the banks the ability to hike these rates without any significant consequence,\" she said. \"These higher rates aren't washing with borrowers who are about to come off their fixed rate and looking to reassess their options. \"For the small proportion of borrowers opting to re-fix, they'd do well to look beyond the big four banks.\"",
