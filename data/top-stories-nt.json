Serenitas' portfolio comprises 27 \"lifestyle communities\" for over 50s at more than 6,200 sites across Australia. The purchase will be a joint venture in which Mirvac and Pacific Equity Partners hold about 47.5% each, with the remaining minority interest held by Tasman Capital Partners. Mirvac's Group CEO Campbell Hanan says the acquisition expands its residential offering. \"Our expansion into the living sectors comes against a backdrop of critical housing undersupply, and tailwinds including rising population growth, record low vacancy levels and affordability challenges,\" he said. Mr Hanan says there are an estimated 7.5 million people over 55 years old in Australia in 2023, with strong forecast growth in this population, projected to almost double over the next 40 years. \"This transaction immediately scales our exposure to the land lease communities sector across Australia and reinforces our position as the only residential developer in Australia delivering across the spectrum of housing typologies from rental housing, build to rent, land lease, house and land, medium density and high density living. This depth of capability leaves Mirvac well placed to benefit from the structural tailwinds supporting the broader living sector in Australia,\" he said. Mirvac will fund the transaction from existing liquidity sources and recent asset disposals.",
