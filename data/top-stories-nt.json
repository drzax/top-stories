Last year, Santos reported a half-year profit of $US1.17 billion. The company's production volume was down by 13% to 45 million barrels of oil equivalent, and sales volume also fell by 15% to 41.7 million barrels of oil equivalent. Sales revenue also fell by 21 per cent, which Santos said was the result of lower realised prices for oil and gas. Despite the fall in profits, Santos will pay a dividend of 8.7 US cents per share, which it says is 14% higher than the previous year's results.",
