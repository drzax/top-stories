All the big banks are now tipping a rate hike on Melbourne Cup Day (November 7), with Westpac switching its call to a hike, having recently said it thought the next move would be a cut sometime next year. \"I've seen enough to make my first-ever rate call to be a prediction of a hike,\" wrote its new chief economist Luci Ellis, who just left the Reserve Bank a few months ago to take up the Westpac role. \"That said, we do not think that a decision to increase rates at the November meeting is entirely clear-cut. \"There is an argument that bygones are bygones, and the upside surprise on the September quarter data will not carry through to subsequent quarters.\" Interestingly, Dr Ellis said she didn't put much store in Reserve Bank governor Michele Bullock's testimony to the Senate this morning, despite it having significantly moved market betting on the direction of rates in November. \"We do not take any signal from the governor's parliamentary testimony this morning on the interpretation of the CPI data,\" the former RBA assistant governor (economic) noted. \"Having spelled out so clearly that a material surprise to the outlook would warrant a rate increase, she simply had to be equivocal to avoid front-running the board's decision, which is still more than a week away.\" So, all four major banks are tipping a rate rise and the market is now again pricing in a 54% (Bloomberg data) or 57% (Refinitiv data) chance of a rate rise on Tuesday, November 7. Previous reports from the Westpac economics team — as recently as two days ago — had rates going down. So the inflation data changed all of that.",
