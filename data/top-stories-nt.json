The Reserve Bank of New Zealand has just raised its official cash rate again, from 5.25% to 5.5%. The RBA's cash rate here is still only 3.85%, despite 11 rate rises over the past year and a bit. The New Zealand economy has already suffered one quarter of contraction, at the end of last year, and another quarter would confirm that the RBNZ has pushed the economy into recession in its efforts to stamp out inflation. That's the outcome that Australia's Reserve Bank is trying to avoid by staying on its \"narrow path\". The RBNZ's decision was not unanimous, with a summary of the meeting showing that board members voted on two options, a pause or a 0.25 percentage point rate hike. Two voted in favour of the pause, while the other five board members voted for the hike. The RBNZ does look like it is at, or getting close to, the top of its rate rise cycle, noting that the economy was already slowing down quite dramatically. \"Consumer spending growth has eased and residential construction activity has declined, while house prices have returned to more sustainable levels,\" it noted in its post-meeting press release. \"More generally, businesses are reporting slower demand for their goods and services, and weak investment intentions. \"Businesses report that a lack of demand, rather than labour shortages, is now the main constraint on activity.\"",
