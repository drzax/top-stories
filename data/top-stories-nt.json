                "plaintext": "A new survey has found two-thirds of Australians who attend arts events and festivals are doing so less frequently. The 2022 National Arts Participation Survey asked some 10,000 people about their engagement with the sector. The results show 68 per cent of the population aged 15 or over attend live events such as concerts, theatre or festivals. That's the same figure as before COVID-19, allaying fears people may have disengaged since the last survey in 2019. But people are attending less frequently, going every few months rather than each week. The cost of living may be biting — about half of those who attend live arts want to go more often, but cost and distance are holding them back.
