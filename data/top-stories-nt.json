But that won’t stop the former president and his supporters from characterising the investigation as a witch hunt and an attempt to interfere in the 2024 election. Trump is still considered the leading candidate for the Republican presidential nomination, while Biden has declared that he’s also running for office again.",

Avatar 4 is now slated to hit theatres in December 2029, with Avatar 5 set to arrive in December 2031! If those dates hold, the Avatar film series will have stretched across the first four decades of the century. Director James Cameron, who launched Avatar in 2009, has said he may not direct films 4 and 5. By December 2031, the 68-year-old would be 77.

And we've had a pretty good lead from overseas to get us started — ASX futures are higher after the S & P 500 hit a fresh 13-month high on Wall Street. The reason for the optimism? The latest US consumer price index showed the smallest annual increase in inflation in more than two years in May. The news comes as the Federal Reserve kicks off its two-day meeting, with a decision on interest rates due tomorrow morning, our time. According to Refinitiv, market pricing puts the odds of no change to US rates tomorrow at 93 per cent. \"A cooling inflation report is fueling this bull market as the Fed should have no problem skipping a rate hike,\" OANDA senior market analyst Edward Moya wrote in a note. \"Wall Street is becoming a little bit hopeful here that an FOMC June skip could eventually become a July pause.\" So stick with us through the day to see how this all plays out.",
