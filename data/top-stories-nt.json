The proposed sale of the 14 sites — valued at $71 million — is to appease the ACCC so the takeover deal is likely to be given the green light. Along with being a fuel refiner, importer and wholesaler, Viva Energy is also a fuel retailer and operates sites across the country — including Coles Express sites. Viva also operates Puma-branded petrol stations in the Northern Territory. Viva Energy announced its acquisition of OTR back in April in a $1.15 billion deal. OTR is a South Australian based petrol station and convenience store, and has more than 160 locations across SA and Victoria. The ACCC is currently reviewing the proposed deal, with the investigation focused on whether the takeover will impact competition and lead to higher fuel or retail prices. Findings from the ACCC into the deal are set to be announced in September.",
