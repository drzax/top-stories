The ban will also cover the use of cryptocurrency and digital currencies. The Minister for Social Services Amanda Rishworth says it will protect vulnerable Australians. \"You can't use your credit card to place a bet for land-based gambling and the same rules should apply for online gambling too.\" Companies could face fines of up to $235,000 if they don't enforce the new rules. Financial Counselling Australia's (FCA) director of policy and campaigns Lauren Levin says it's a major win in the battle to reduce gambling harm. \"Digital currencies can have wild fluctuations in value, so not only do people speculate on their bets, but also on the movement in the digital currency.\" However, the FCA is disappointed online lotteries won't be included in the ban. \"Online lotteries have changed the whole situation, as the danger of losing large sums is now just as high as someone gambling on online sports betting. \"There is no good reason for online lotteries to allow people to buy a $10,000 ticket on credit, or for people to enter a $3,000 syndicate on credit. \"Gambling is gambling.\"",
