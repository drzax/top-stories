              "plaintext": "The ABC's North America bureau chief Jade Macmillan has more: Jade: There’s a familiar pattern to the way Donald Trump has responded to the three criminal cases brought against him. The former president once again broke the news of his impending indictment himself on his social media platform, Truth Social. He followed up that post with a statement accusing federal prosecutors of trying to interfere in next year’s presidential race, in which he’s still considered the leading candidate for the Republican nomination. And just like in the other two cases, his team immediately started appealing to supporters for donations. “What better way to show that YOU stood by the President’s side through *EVERY* phony indictment than your very own Limited-Edition “I STAND WITH TRUMP” T-Shirt, ” an email read. Donald Trump’s campaign says he’s raised millions of dollars since he was indicted in New York earlier this year, but reports suggest his legal fees have also put major pressure on his political action committee.

              "plaintext": "After the Reserve Bank kept official interest rates on hold yesterday at 4.1 per cent, more economists think this may be the end of the RBA's rate-hiking cycle. RBA governor Philip Lowe noted that higher interest rates were bringing down inflation, but did not rule out raising borrowing costs again with annual inflation running at 6 per cent. Barrenjoey chief economist Jo Masters has lowered her forecasts for where official rates will peak, from 4.6 per cent to 4.1 per cent. She says it is likely the RBA board thinks there have been enough interest rate rises to lower inflation to between 2 to 3 per cent by mid-2025. \"We read today’s statement as a signal that the board believes there is sufficient  tightening in the pipeline to achieve their inflation objective; that they want to be done  with the tightening cycle. \"This sets a high bar to further rate hikes, and the onus on  the data to surprise sufficiently to force the board’s hand back to the table.\" UBS chief economist George Tharenou has lowered his forecast for the terminal rate from 4.35 per cent to 4.1 per cent, although a 0.25 per cent rise in November is possible, before a cut mid next year. The Commonwealth Bank now also expects the cash rate to remain on hold at 4.1 per cent for an extended period. National Australia Bank expects the peak cash rate to reach 4.35 per cent in November. Interest rate rises are slowing the economy with weaker inflation and retail sales. The recovery in home prices is also easing. Here's more from Stephanie Chalmers on The Business.",
