Speaking to Radio National this morning, the Israeli intelligence expert and former Mossad chief said his country could not and should not stomach a situation where its citizens were being held hostage. \"We've declared war and we have to realise we cannot be choosy in some of the means we have …. to reset the balance between us and them,\" he said. When asked whether collective punishment by cutting off water and electricity was justified Mr Halevy said there are no rules when it came to terror. He also warned Israel has a lot of means for making things very difficult for Hamas. \"We cannot forget they (Hamas) are a terrorist group and in combatting terror you cannot simply go by the book,\" he said.",
