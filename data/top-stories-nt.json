The 51-year-old Australian lodged an appeal in Britain's High Court last year after the UK government signed an order authorising his extradition to the US. The court this week rejected his appeal in a three-page written decision from Justice Jonathan Swift. In a statement on Twitter, Assange's wife Stella says her husband will contest the ruling – which will be his last legal option in the UK in his long-running legal saga.

According to RateCity, the average family’s maximum borrowing capacity has shrunk by $247,700 compared to April last year, once the latest hike takes effect. The 'average' RateCity has used is a family of four, with one parent working full time, one working part time, on a combined annual income of $143,221 before tax — and that obviously doesn't account of individuals' particular circumstances. For a single person earning the average wage, with no debts, no dependents and minimal expenses, the maximum amount they can borrow from the bank will have dropped by $180,000 in the last 14 months. \"People on the hunt for a new home have been dealing with a market that's defying gravity, on a budget that gets smaller by the month,\" said RateCity research director Sally Tindall. \"Once this latest cash rate decision takes effect, the big banks' ongoing variable rates are likely to be over 6 per cent, which means borrowers will soon be stress tested at rates of over 9 per cent. \" That's a staggering hurdle to clear, particularly for first home buyers with limited savings and smaller incomes. \"If prices don't come down, potential first home buyers could end up sitting on the sidelines altogether, unless they can get a sizeable leg up from their family.\" It's also going to impact borrowers trying to refinance, as they'll be assessed on their ability to repay on the same stress-tested rates over 9 per cent — putting more people into the 'mortgage prisoner' camp, particularly those with newer or lower equity loans.",

Stephanie Chalmers here to take you through the day, and it's looking set to be a pretty positive start to the session with futures pointing higher. It follows some decent gains on Wall Street, particularly for tech stocks. Amazon rose 2.5%, while Netflix ended up 2.4%. Electric carmaker Tesla also did well, rising 4.6%. The US dollar came under some pressure as oil prices slumped, and some data on weekly jobless claims was worse than expected, which helped the Aussie dollar above 67 US cents. In Europe, markets were mostly higher but eurozone economic growth was revised lower for the first quarter, down 0.1 per cent. And since that's the second quarter of economic contraction in a row, that means a 'technical recession'. It's been a pretty massive week, with the Reserve Bank raising rates for a 12th time and Australia's economic growth slowing, so stick with us, ahead of what's a long weekend in some states (the ASX will be closed on Monday).",
