High seas are international waters that aren't controlled by any nation, and make up two-thirds of the world's oceans and cover half of the Earth's surface. That means there are almost no safeguards and they're heavily exposed to over-exploitation. Until now. Foreign Minister Penny Wong put pen to paper overnight at the UN General Assembly in New York. She says Australia will work with Pacific countries to support them to also sign the treaty. The treaty aims to achieve more cooperative management of global fisheries and deal with pollution threats. It will take effect after 60 countries ratify the agreement. Nations that sign on will have to assess the environmental impacts of any planned activities beyond their jurisdictions.",
