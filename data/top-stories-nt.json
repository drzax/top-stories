While 6.3% year-on-year growth is nothing to sneeze at, and a big improvement from the first quarter's 4.5%, it was still way off what analysts were hoping to see. The median forecast was for 7.3% growth. ANZ's Betty Wang says more detail from the GDP data will be released tomorrow, but other information highlights China's economic problems. \"More business weakness is seen in the private sector compared with their state-owned counterparts. FAI (fixed-asset investment) growth of the private sector contracted by 0.2% y/y YTD in June, the second month of decline, versus 8.1% growth of the state-owned sector,\" she noted. Fixed-asset investment not only drives growth now, but lays the foundations for future growth. \"The surveyed youth unemployment rate rose to 21.3% in June for the16-24 years age group, advancing for the sixth consecutive month since January,\" Ms Wang observed. Amid a sluggish labour market and falling property prices, Chinese residents are saving even more than usual. \"Household deposits grew 17-18% y/y in H1, the highest level in the past decade. The outstanding amount is equivalent to more than 30 months of retail sales,\" Ms Wang added. Despite a seemingly strong 6.3% headline growth rate, few indicators are pointing to a Chinese economy roaring back into life post-COVID.",
