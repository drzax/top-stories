However, the danger at this point in time has passed. People are beginning to move back into their homes which is great. \"The fires when through very, very quickly from when the evacuation was called to when the fire got there. In the hills, they just move at a great pace of knots, especially when they're fanned with the wind. \"Of course, the loss of any property would be devastating for those residents who have been affected. \"And you know, my heart goes out to those people who have lost their properties. You know that your home is your castle. You've got so many family memories in there. You know, kids and photos and all those sorts of things. So I can't begin to imagine what those people who have lost their homes are going through at the moment. \"But, you know, we didn't lose any people and you know, that's our primary concern is to make sure that our people are as safe as possible. And our Fire and Emergency Services have done a wonderful job.\"",

Crews were called back to the Bonogin Valley at 6:40am on Wednesday, following reports a fire they believe was deliberately lit yesterday reignited. Six fires were lit along a road on Tuesday, prompting crews to respond rapidly to stop them spreading in the dry, hot conditions. Chief Superintendent Alan Gillespie said crews managed to get to the fires quickly. \"We were able to scramble resources fairly quickly and they are all out but we will be quite vigilant\" Mr Gillespie said. \"It is just incredible that people are doing stupid things like that,\" he said A Queensland Fire and Emergency Services (QFES) spokesman said the reignited fire had been extinguished. Mr Gillespie says they have a number of leads, and that police are investigating. \"I just can't understand the mentality of people who go out and put the community and our firefighters on the line and under risk just for some perverse thrill of seeing vehicles responding to fires.\" Queensland Police have been contacted for comment.",

I’ve been here watching the war inside Gaza. It means we’ve been able to see the evidence of Israeli’s constant bombardment into the north – building after building that is damaged or completely destroyed. The whole area looks like a big grey pile of ash, because any of the buildings that are left standing are covered in concrete dust. It’s actually pretty eerie to look at. Almost every few seconds, we hear the battle unfolding on the ground. War planes fly overhead and then we hear a huge explosion – we see a massive plume of smoke rise into the sky. Another airstrike. Suddenly there are several loud bangs close by. Israeli tanks stationed near the Gaza border are firing from the ground into the Strip. I see several bright flashes of light, as artillery is fired. I can hear machine guns as Hamas militants are locked in gun battle with Israeli troops on the ground. It sounds like it’s coming from the north but we can’t be sure because the Israeli military isn’t really telling us a lot of information of what’s happening on the ground.",

The bank is also raising the international transaction fee on select credit cards from December 1, 2023. From today, the interest rate on eight of CBA's credit cards will rise to 20.99 per cent. These changes follow CBA's increase to the purchase rate on its Low Rate card on August 25, where the rate was hiked 0.75 percentage points to 13.99 per cent. This rate has not been changed today. \"The last thing customers carrying around credit card debt need is a higher interest rate,\" RateCity research director Sally Tindall said. \"If you're someone who can't clear their credit card bill every single month, you should not be holding a card with a rate that's over 15 per cent — even 10 per cent is too high. \" There are 14 cards on the market offering rates under 10 per cent, along with five cards that charge fees instead of interest. \"At 3.50 per cent, CBA now has one of the highest international transaction fees in the market, but only on select cards.\"",

It turns out that there are still more Aussies moving from the capital cities to the regions than vice versa, with recent years seeing the reversal of a decades long population drain from regional areas. \"In the 12 months to September 2023, capital to regional migration accounted for an 11% share of all relocations, compared to 9.1% making the move from the regions to the city,\" the report found. While newly arrived migrants from overseas overwhelmingly tend to settle in the big capitals, particularly Sydney and Melbourne, existing residents are still exiting the big smoke, especially Sydney. A stunning 80% of net capital city outflows came from Sydney, with a further 27% from Melbourne — the reason those two cities exceed 100% is that Brisbane (11%) and Perth (5%) are still attracting a lot of internal migrants. In terms of where these people are moving, it is often still reasonably close to home, with regional NSW now the most popular destination (39% of people who left a capital city moved there), followed by Queensland (33%) and Victoria (27%). As for exactly where people are moving, Queensland's Sunshine Coast continued to top the list, followed by Greater Geelong and the Gold Coast in a tie for second, then the Fraser Coast in Queensland and Moorabool in regional Victoria. Lake Macquarie in NSW is also among the most popular destinations for previous city dwellers. As for the biggest growth areas for city slickers to move to over the past year, Mackay in northern Queensland topped the list, along with Douglas and the Whitsundays from the same part of the world, with the Snowy Valleys in NSW and Ceduna in South Australia also making the list. \"The increasing popularity of these more remote regional growth hotspots, boosted by good regional job prospects and the likelihood of better house prices and availability, has seen some previously popular LGAs come off the boil,\" the report noted. \"For example, LGAs that had amongst the highest net internal migration inflows a year ago (to September 2022) but reported net outflows over the past 12 months include big regional New South Wales centres such as Wagga Wagga, Dubbo, Bathurst, Albury, Lismore, Newcastle, Byron and Orange as well as Mount Gambier in South Australia and West Tamar in Tasmania.\"",
