Gross domestic product in Germany fell by 0.3% in the first three months of the year, and followed a decline of 0.5% in the final three months of last year. An economy is defined as being in recession after two successive negative quarters of economic growth. Germany's finance minister Christian Lindner said the GDP data showed \"surprisingly negative signals\". The country's economy minister Robert Habeck said Germany's previous high dependency on Russia for energy supply led to the recession, and growth forecasts were much bleaker. Household consumption was down 1.2% quarter on quarter after price, seasonal and calendar adjustments. Government spending also decreased significantly, by 4.9%, on the quarter.",
