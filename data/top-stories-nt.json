              "plaintext": "The Australian Competition Tribunal has upheld the ACCC's decision last year to block a regional network sharing agreement between TPG and Telstra. Here's some more details of the Tribunal's reasoning from the ACCC : The Tribunal denied authorisation because it was not satisfied that the proposed arrangements were not likely to have the effect of a substantial lessening of competition or that the benefit to the public likely to result would outweigh the detriment. The Tribunal noted that the proposed arrangements would give Telstra substantial benefits and increase its market strength on the retail and wholesale mobile markets, and would undermine Optus' incentives to invest in 5G technology. Over time, this would weaken the competitive constraint on Telstra, and lead to increased prices and margins. The Tribunal found that \"the Spectrum Authorisation Agreement provides Telstra with substantial commercial and competitive benefits and would further increase Telstra's position of market strength in mobile telecommunications markets.\" Understandably, Telstra and TPG aren't too happy that their deal remains blocked and are reviewing their options. On the other hand, Optus is very pleased, calling it \"a win for Australians\". \"We are delighted that the Tribunal has upheld the ACCC’s original decision to block this anti-competitive arrangement,\" said Optus boss Kelly Bayer Rosmarin. \"This reinforces the importance of infrastructure-based competition and investment in our communications sector that will have lasting benefits for regional Australia. \"This is a good outcome for our regional communities as it will mean they will continue to benefit from competition as Optus reaffirms its commitment to providing Australia’s regional communities with a strong network and great service.\" Optus expects to spend $1.6 billion on infrastructure and services investment this year. In its statement to the market today, TPG reaffirmed its earnings guidance for the current financial year. It also said if the Telstra agreement ultimately does not proceed it may adjust its future capital expenditure plans \"for higher short-term investment at sites within its existing regional network\" which would've been decommissioned or transferred under the arrangement.",

The deal would've seen TPG decommission or transfer regional mobile sites, and then acquire mobile services from Telstra. TPG says it would've increased its mobile network coverage from 96 per cent to 98.8 per cent of the Australian population. At the end of last year, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission rejected the plans, arguing there was a real risk it would reduce investment in infrastructure. Telstra and TPG challenged the decision but now the Australian Competition Tribunal has upheld it. \"This determination entrenches the status quo for mobile coverage in regional Australia,\" TPG boss Iñaki Berroeta said today. TPG is now considering its options for a further appeal. At the time it blocked the sharing deal, the ACCC said there would be some short-term benefits in improving TPG's network coverage, but that it could lessen infrastructure-based competition. \"Competition between separate mobile networks drives companies to improve coverage for mobile users and to offer new technologies to more areas. \"For example, when Optus improves its regional network, Telstra responds by improving its network to maintain its market position,\" ACCC Commissioner Liza Carver said in December. \"Infrastructure competition is what drives investments by mobile companies in broader, deeper and faster mobile coverage… We have concluded the proposed arrangements would likely significantly weaken this competitive process.\"",

There are some falls for iron ore miners, including a 2 per cent drop for Fortescue shares. This morning Fortescue updated the market, saying executive chairman Andrew Forrest had transferred ownership of around $5 billion worth of shares (220 million FMG shares) to his philanthropic venture, the Minderoo Foundation — that's one-fifth of the family's holding in the miner. Gold mining stocks are also under pressure, including Silver Lake Resources (-4%). And TPG Telecom shares have slumped more than 8 per cent on news the Australian Competition Tribunal has blocked a regional network sharing arrangement with Telstra. Telstra shares are up 0.6 per cent. It's a better session for consumer stocks, with some retailers on the rise including Woolworths (+0.7%) and Coles (+0.9%). Here's how the sectors are faring:",
