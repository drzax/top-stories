But that aid will be a \"drop in the ocean\" and won't help as it should if Israeli bombs continue to pound the Gaza Strip, CEO of the Egyptian Food Bank Mohsen Sarhan has warned. Speaking to Radio National's David Lipson, Mr Sarhan said whatever aid was coming into Gaza now was just \"window dressing\". \"We're having a grave situation in Gaza now — doctors (have) started doing surgeries without anaesthetics and without antibiotics … people are being tortured to have surgeries without anaesthetics — it's a very bad situation,\" he said. \"People there are dying by the hundreds every day and the death has reached a level that they can't even bring their dead out from the rubble … they don't have equipment to get the dead out. They don't even have body bags to bury them, it's turning into an open graveyard.\" He said aid agencies were angry and frustrated at how long it was taking to help the people of Gaza, with many unable to operate safely. \"The killing has to stop … if the ceasefire happens and the killing stops, aid will have a meaning, but right now it's a complete mess there. We have the money and we have the supplies but the bombing doesn't stop.\"",

              "plaintext": "Israel says its aircraft struck two Hezbollah cells in Lebanon early on Monday local time that were planning to launch anti-tank missiles and rockets toward Israel as fighting flares across the two countries' shared border. Lebanon's state-run news agency NNA reported Hezbollah saying one of its fighters was killed, without providing details. NNA has also reported an Israeli air strike on the southern outskirts of Aitaroun, in southern Lebanon. It also did not provide details. The Israeli military said one cell was adjacent to the Israeli town of Mattat, around 13 km south-west of Aitaroun. It said the other was further north in the disputed Shebaa Farms area. It was not immediately clear if the two sides were referring to the same set of incidents. On social media platform Telegram, the IDF says it \"thwarted\" planned attacks from Hezbollah cells. \"A short while ago, the IDF identified two Hezbollah terrorist cells in Lebanese territory. One cell was adjacent to the area of Mattat, and planned to launch anti-tank missiles toward Israeli territory,\" the post read. \"The other, located in Har Dov, planned to launch rockets. The IDF thwarted the attacks, striking the Hezbollah terrorist cells before they fired.\" Israel says it later struck more Hezbollah targets, including a compound and an observation post. There are no immediate reports of injuries or damage. Iran-backed Hezbollah and Israel have been trading fire at the frontier with increasing frequency since Palestinian group Hamas carried out a shock attack on Israel on October 7 and Israel responded with intense air strikes on Gaza. Israel has moved to evacuate 42 communities along its northern front with Lebanon over the fighting, which Hezbollah says has killed at least 27 of its fighters since October 7. Lebanese security sources say 11 fighters with Palestinian groups in Lebanon, allied to Hezbollah, have been killed in the border area, alongside four civilians. At least five Israeli soldiers and one civilian have been killed on Israel's side of the frontier, according to Israeli military reports.",

Lieutenant Colonel Jonathon Conricus spoke to Raf Epstein on ABC Radio Melbourne a short time ago. He was asked whether it was certain that Israel would mount a ground invasion of Gaza. \"The aim here is to totally dismantle Hamas from its military capabilities. If that can be done from the air and with stand-off measures, with very limited exposure to our troops and less damage on the ground, that would be great,\" he said. \"If Hamas was to come out of their hiding places … return our hostages, all 212 of them, and surrender unconditionally, then the war would end. \"If they won't, we would probably have to go in and get it done.\" Lt. Col. Conricus also suggested protests being carried out against Israel, in Australia and abroad, were being attended by people who were \"either uninformed or really filled with hate towards Israel based on things that have nothing to do with what's going on in Gaza now.\" \"If you stand with an organisation that sent a thousand or more armed men into a sovereign country in order to execute, burn alive, rape, butcher, mutilate and behead civilians … that's where you stand,\" he said. \"Those are your morals and that is how you will go down in history.\" The vast majority of those taking part in Pro-Palestinian protests around the world are holding up signs in support of Palestinian people and against air strikes in Gaza, rather than in support of Hamas. The Gaza health ministry says at least 4,651 people have been killed in Gaza, with more than a thousand being children.",

              "plaintext": "The September quarter Consumer Price Index (CPI) from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) is going to be critical for the Reserve Bank's decision on whether it needs to raise interest rates at least once more, possibly as soon as November 7. So what are economists expecting to see at 11:30am AEDT this Wednesday when the ABS publishes CPI data for both the month and quarter of September? Westpac, which publishes a very detailed category-by-category breakdown of its forecast, is tipping both headline and 'trimmed mean' figures to come in at 1.1% for the quarter and 5.3 and 5% for the year, respectively. ( Trimmed mean is a key \"underlying\" measure of inflation preferred by the Reserve Bank because it excludes the most volatile price moves up and down). Westpac senior economist Justin Smirk says there are big uncertainties about just how much temporary electricity bill rebates and permanently increased childcare subsidies will offset price rises in those sectors, making forecasting harder than usual. \" Auto fuel is making the most significant contribution in the September quarter (+0.26ppt), closely followed by utilities (0.24ppt), food (0.17ppt), rents (0.13ppt), financial services (0.10ppt) and then dwelling purchases (0.09ppt).\" CBA's forecast for inflation is a little lower, at 0.9 and 1% for the headline and trimmed mean, respectively. It believes such a result would see the RBA sit tight in November. \"Our forecast for Q3 23 CPI is broadly similar to the RBA's implied profile from August. We believe this is consistent with monetary policy on hold in November.\" However, the bank's economists warn that the risks are to the upside for inflation, and a result much higher than forecast could see the RBA hike the cash rate by 0.25%pt next month. UBS's George Tharenou is forecasting an even higher 1.2%/1.1% headline/underlying result, which would add to pressure for a rate rise. ANZ's economists see the result as being 1.1/1.2% for headline and trimmed mean, which they say could see another rate hike. \"This outcome, particularly for trimmed mean, would cause the RBA some discomfort given its 'low tolerance for a slower return of inflation to target' than current forecasts. \"As we noted after the most recent minutes, risks of RBA action in the near-term appear to be rising. For now, we expect the cash rate to remain at 4.1%, although we'll ultimately make a call on the November Board meeting in the wake of the CPI.\" For what it's worth, the typical forecast according to a survey of economists by Reuters is for both headline and trimmed mean inflation to rise 1.1% in the quarter, or 5.3% and 5% up respectively over the past year. Financial markets are currently pricing in about a 30% chance of the RBA lifting the cash rate in a fortnight's time.",

The benchmark indices are down around 0.8% in early trade, with the ASX 200 at 6,845 points. Mining and energy are dominating the early falls, with real estate and consumer cyclical stocks also down on fears of an economic slowdown due to higher interest rates persisting for longer. In a clearly 'risk-off' day, the sectors posting solid gains are the more 'defensive' ones of consumer non-cyclicals and healthcare — the kinds of businesses we can't avoid when we're cutting spending. Treasury Wine Estates is one of the ASX 200's top gainers, up 3% to $12.12, after the Australian Government said China is undertaking a five month review into punitive wine tariffs, with a widespread expectation they will be removed early next year. The other top rises around 10:20am AEDT were: Weebit Nano +4% to $3.91 Bellevue Gold +3.7% to $1.555 BlueScope Steel +1.8% to $18.23 ARB Corp +1.8% to $30.81 The biggest falls were for: New Hope Corporation -7.7% to $5.97 Liontown Resources -3.7% to $1.83 Champion Iron -3.5% to $6.06 Pilbara Minerals -3.5% to $3.725 South32 -3% to $3.27",

              "plaintext": "The Chinese ambassador dropped a strong hint last Wednesday, and now the Australian government is saying it is hopeful the tariffs will be gone by next year. China has told Australia it intends to take five months to review its wine tariff policy on Australian exports. Treasury Wine Estates jumped around 5% last Wednesday before giving back nearly 4% over the subsequent couple of days. Treasury was up 2.6% today to $12.07 by 10:43am AEDT. UBS analyst Shaun Cousins has reiterated his buy recommendation on the stock with a price target of $13.75 after the latest news. \"A removal of duties imposed by China on Australian wine would be a positive for TWE: (1) Existing Australian Penfolds volumes to be reallocated from other markets (as well as multi-country of origin & One by Penfolds, which are both sold into China & other markets), plus Premium Brands (e.g. Rawson's Retreat) volumes as TWE noted. (2) New TWE-owned & grower volumes to be accessed over time (3-5yr wine cycle). (3) NSR/case to be higher as a modest (less than 10%) premium price in China & stronger global demand drives scarcity, which enables further global pricing growth. (4) P/E multiple re-rating (UBSe ~2-3pts) as TWE would have access to a large luxury wine market.\" In short, the removal of tariffs will be a modest positive for TWE if it happens, even if it's taking a bit longer than the removal of barley tariffs. If China doesn't drop the tariffs at the end of the five-month review, then Australia would need to resume its case at the World Trade Organisation, which would be a negative for TWE and other wine producers as it would be a lengthy process.
