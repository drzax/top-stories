US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin said he had placed additional American forces on prepare-to-deploy orders to \"increase their readiness and ability to quickly respond as required\". He did not specify how many troops. The US will also send a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system and additional Patriot air defence missile system battalions to the region, and redirect the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower aircraft carrier to the \"central command area of responsibility\". The warship will join the USS Gerald R. Ford carrier, which is currently operating in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea. \"These steps will bolster regional deterrence efforts, increase force protection for US forces in the region, and assist in the defense of Israel,\" Austin said. \"I will continue to assess our force posture requirements in the region and consider deploying additional capabilities as necessary.\" Reuters/ABC",

The Palestinian Red Crescent ambulance service said at least one Palestinian was killed and three others injured. It had earlier said that two people were killed. Israel said the compound beneath al-Ansar Mosque, in Jenin, belonged to operatives from Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad who were responsible for attacks in recent months. \"Intel was recently received which indicated that the terrorists, [who] were neutralized, were organizing an imminent terror attack,\" the military said in a statement. Jenin refugee camp, a Palestinian militant stronghold, was the focus of a major Israeli military operation earlier this year.",
