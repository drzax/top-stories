Gaza normally gets its water supplies from a combination of sources, including a pipeline from Israel, desalination plants on the Mediterranean Sea and wells. Those supplies were slashed when Israel cut off water, along with the fuel and electricity that run water and sewage plants, in the wake of the Hamas attacks. The United Nations recognises access to water as a human right. Dehydration can cause dizziness, fatigue and confusion and in severe cases lead to organ failure and death, with children, the elderly and those with health conditions particularly vulnerable. Water access is also crucial for sanitation, and a lack of clean water can lead to the spread of infections like cholera and dysentery. Diarrhoeal diseases that can be spread by unclean water are the leading cause of death for children under the age of five across the world, said Dr Tsion Firew, an emergency physician at Columbia University who has worked on water access in humanitarian settings. Healthcare settings are a particular concern as they rely on clean water to care for patients who are sick and injured. As hospitals across the Gaza Strip struggle to care for thousands of patients, the World Health Organization said the lack of water is putting lives in danger. \"Water is needed to ensure sanitary conditions on inpatient wards, in operation rooms, and emergency departments. It is essential for the prevention of hospital-associated infections and for the prevention of outbreaks in hospitals,\" it said in a statement. AP",

Only four countries of the 15 UNSC members joined Russia in voting for the resolution. Four countries, including the United States, voted against it. Six countries abstained. Russia's UN ambassador, Vassily Nebenzia, had urged support for the resolution to respond to the \"unprecedented exacerbation\" of the situation, citing the council's inaction since the October 7 attack by Hamas. A vote on a rival resolution from Brazil that would condemn the Hamas attack was delayed. The Russian draft resolution would have called for \"an immediate, durable and fully respected humanitarian cease-fire\" and \"strongly condemns all violence and hostilities directed against civilians and all acts of terrorism\". The Brazilian draft resolution calls for \"humanitarian pauses\" and also \"firmly condemns all violence and hostilities against civilians and all acts of terrorism\". But it also \"unequivocally rejects and condemns the heinous terrorist attacks by Hamas\". AP",

The video was posted on Hamas' Telegram channel and shows a young woman with a bandaged arm speaking Hebrew. She says her name is Mia Schem, she is 21 years old and from Shoham, near Tel Aviv. In the video she asks to be returned to her family as quickly as possible. A representative of the family, which was among a group of French families that appealed last week to President Emmanuel Macron to help free their missing relatives, confirmed her identity to Reuters. The Israel Defense Forces reacted to the video and said that Schem's family was notified of her abduction last week and that they are in continuous contact with them at this time. \"In the video, Hamas is trying to portray itself as a humane organization, while it is a responsible for the murder and abduction of babies, women, children, and elderly,\" the IDF statement said.
