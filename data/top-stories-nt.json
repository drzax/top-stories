Tourism Minister Don Farrell said it will be a major boost to tourism and he expects travel from China to bounce back by Christmas. \"China is terrifically important to our tourism sector,\" he told The Business. \"Pre-pandemic, China was our largest source of tourism, worth about $12 billion to the Australian economy.\" The Approved Destination Status (ADS) visitor visa allows Chinese tourists from some parts of China to travel to Australia in guided groups. They made up about a third of total group visitors from China and had spent about $581 million in Australia in 2019. Mr Farrell said he expects that by year's end \" we'll be back up to where we were pre-pandemic \". China lifted a ban on group tours to Australia in August, which some say contributed to a thawing relationship.
