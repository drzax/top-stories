Rafah, the border crossing into Gaza that Egypt had promised to open on Friday, is a few dozen kilometres to the east. It is the only crossing into the blockaded Palestinian territory that is not controlled by Israel. Ahmed Ali, head of the Egyptian Red Crescent, told AFP his organisation receives \"two to three planes of aid a day, chartered by humanitarian agencies or states\", who want to send food, water or medical supplies to the 2.4 million Palestinians in Gaza. As soon as aid is dropped off on the tarmac, the shipments are loaded onto trucks. Egyptian state-linked broadcaster Al Qahera News said the Rafa crossing would open on Friday. But later Egypt said it needed more time, to repair the roads that connect its territory to Gaza after four Israeli bombings of the crossing. In the meantime, pallets loaded with aid are stored in warehouses in El Arish, the capital of North Sinai, said Ali. As soon as the green light is given, 250 volunteers are ready to transport them to the border. The deal struck by US President Joe Biden with Israel and Egypt will allow in 20 trucks. The emergencies director of the World Health Organization has called it \"a drop in the ocean of need\". \"It should be 2,000 trucks,\" Michael Ryan said. AFP",

The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) on Friday said Peter Collins was \"not a fit and proper person to provide financial services\" and that it was in the public interest for him to be barred from working in the sector for a period. ASIC found that Mr Collins disclosed confidential information he obtained in his roles as a tax advisor to the Commonwealth Treasury and the Australian Board of Taxation. For the duration of his ban, Mr Collins cannot provide financial services, control an entity that carries on a financial services business or perform any function involved in the carrying on of a financial services business. Mr Collins has the right to apply to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal for a review of ASIC's decision.

Dr Oliver also notes that uncertainty remains high around China's economy and property markets and the US remains at high risk of a shutdown next month. \"So, the ride for shares is likely to remain volatile,\" he said. The Australian dollar was also \"at risk of more downside in the short term\". This was because of \"a less hawkish RBA and global uncertainties\". \"But a rising trend is likely over the next 12 months, reflecting a downtrend in the overvalued US dollar and the Fed moving to cut rates,\" he said.
