              "plaintext": "Consulting firm EY was in the hot seat today at the Senate inquiry into consulting firms, which was sparked by the PwC tax scandal. EY's chief executive for Oceania David Larocca told the committee that PwC's actions were \"deeply disturbing and disappointing conduct.\" \"The practices that triggered the establishment of this inquiry are not the way we do business.\" But senators concentrated on the pay of EY partners. EY Oceania boss David Larocca was forced by Labor senator Deborah O'Neill to justify his $2.8 million salary. \"So you're earning five times the value of the prime minister, does that seem like a fair recompense?\" Ms O'Neill asked. \"Firstly, I don't set my partner income. And I'm not here to compare my income with the prime minister's, with a premier, with a government secretary, with any of our clients. \"There's not a day when I don't think how privileged I am,\" Mr Larocca told the committee. The committee heard yesterday that Deloitte boss Adam Powick was paid $3.5 million, while sacked former PwC boss Tom Seymour was paid $4.6 million. EY told the committee that its revenue in 2023 was $2.75 billion, 25 per cent of which, or around $700 million, came from government contracts. You can have a listen to the committee hearing in this report from my colleague David Sparkes.",
