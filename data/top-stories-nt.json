They collect the data to help their clients figure out which stocks to buy, but they're also useful to see where a lot of inflation and cost of living pressures are coming from. The April study shows Coles has recently overtaken Woolworths for price rises, although Woolworths had been ahead for most of the past few years. Coles prices jumped sharply in April, up 10.5% over the past year, compared to a 9.1% annual rise in March. Woolworths prices eased slightly from a 9.7% annual rise in March to an 8.7% increase over the year to April. Coles had higher price rises for both fresh and dry goods, according to the UBS survey of more than 60,000 prices online. UBS analyst Shaun Cousins says the monthly data is volatile, but useful nonetheless. \"The increasing rate of food inflation is a surprise, and inconsistent with the declines reported by COL and WOW in 3Q23. \"We suggest the achievement of a new peak in food inflation (ex-tobacco) is due to ongoing cost pressures on suppliers due to commodities & the domestic supply chain including labour.\" The good news is that he expects food inflation to likely have peaked last month, with modest declines over the rest of the year. A separate regular study of food and beverage prices by his UBS colleague Evan Karatzas also found inflation for dairy, spreads, meat, fruit and vegetables was 9% over the year to April, above the general inflation rate of 7%. Again, the focus is on data useful to investors, so the study focuses on listed companies, such as Bega, Costa and Inghams. The study found average dairy and spreads prices had increased 13 per cent compared to April a year ago, meat prices were up 9 per cent and fruit and vegetable prices were flat. There was some positive news for the meat eaters amongst us, though. \" Dollar meat prices across the main categories are\nstarting to decline m/m [month-on-month], although still remain elevated relative to the prior period. \"By\nproduct Chicken prices +10% (-1% vs. Mar-23), Pork +10% (-4% vs. Mar-23),\nBeef+7% (+6% vs. Mar-23), and Lamb +11% (-4% vs. pcp). Chicken remains the best\nvalue protein for consumers.\" For dairy consumers, the next week and a bit are crunch time for prices, with processors having to tell farmers their planned farmgate milk price intentions for next financial year by June 1. Coles is planning to offer $10-11 per kilogram and Bulla between $8.80-9.60. UBS said the average farmgate price last year was $9.40/kilogram, so it looks like dairy price inflation will slow considerably from last year's huge price jumps.",

The energy sector is now the only part of the market in the black, up around 0.9%, but everything else is going backwards. Out of the top 200 companies, 136 were losing ground while only 57 companies were gaining, as of 1:10pm AEST. However, most of the falls were fairly modest, as investors seem to be waiting for some more clues about how the US debt ceiling crisis is likely to play out.

Do we sink with the great American ship? - Mitchell. Hi Mitchell, I just received a very relevant note from investment bank UBS, where its US chief economist Jonathan Pingle looks at exactly the question of what might happen if the US defaults. Here are some highlights (or lowlights might be the more apt term). But just remember, this is only the forecasts of economists at one investment bank and not any kind of financial advice. So UBS is already expecting the S & P 500 share index to drop 5% this quarter (to June 30) and finish the year flat as the US goes into recession. That's its baseline forecast. \"If the X-date is crossed without a formal default, we see the drop in Q2 deepening a further 5% to 3750, but proving temporary. \" A 1-week period of no coupon payment and default would trigger up to a 20% drop in stocks towards 3400, and keep them suppressed at those low levels through Q3 before making a partial recovery towards 3800 by year end. \"The very unlikely scenario of a month long non payment of coupon would not only cause an immediate drop of up to 30% in stocks, it would also see a very weak recovery, the S & P500 ending 5% below current levels even by end '24.\" Ouch. 20 per cent is a bear market, so any kind of default is likely to push US stocks straight into one, according to UBS. But a lot of that money is expected to go into, wait for it, US treasuries. Yes, the very thing that will have just defaulted. \" US yields will fall, not rise, even if the US defaults on its debt obligations. Treasuries\nflight-to-quality status comes more from liquidity than from credit quality, and the\ndownswing in the economic cycle should obscure the rise in term premia that likely follow missed coupons,\" Pingle writes. Here's Pingle's views on the prospects for currencies. \"Only a 1 month long impasse post the X-date is likely to cause a tightening of financing\nconditions sharp enough that it causes the dollar to rally strongly. In all other cases the\ndollar is likely to sell off amidst uncertainty. \"The worst case for the dollar is if the X-date is\ncrossed without default; de-dollarisation becomes a real threat in this case. JPY [Japanese yen] longs\nagainst AUD [Aussie dollar] and CAD [Canadian dollar] and Gold calls are the cleanest ways to hedge against a US\ndefault. We see Gold doing well through all levels of uncertainty and default .\" So that's the UBS economics team view. No doubt there are many other opinions on exact outcomes, but a strong analyst consensus that we'd be in for a very wild ride if the US passes the \"X date\" without a debt ceiling deal.",
