Lots of media are positioned here to capture images of the Israeli airstrikes, which I can hear continually. They're big, loud booms that reverberate across southern Israel and Gaza. I've also been hearing artillery fire from Israeli troops training. As I've been driving around I've been seeing dozens of troop carriers, trucks and soldiers who are amassed in the south. Interestingly there's been a massive decrease in the number of Hamas rockets being sent into Israel one the last two days. I've heard only one this morning so far.",
