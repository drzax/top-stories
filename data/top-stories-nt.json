This is as good as footy gets. For long periods of that second quarter it looked the Lions had the Pies right where they wanted them. Certainly on paper this sort of free-flowing game seemed to suit Brisbane more than Collingwood. But somehow, the Pies have dug out a half-time lead. Bobby Hill has four goals and is the most dangerous forward on the field — some doing considering how good Joe Daniher, Zac Bailey and Lincoln McCarthy have been. The Pies are leading the contested possesions but the Lions brought equalled things up in the clearances in that quarter. If Brisbane continue to work that ledger in their favour, life will start to become difficult for Collingwood. I have no idea what happens next. But I can not wait to watch it.",
