Private 2nd Class Travis King entered North Korea while on a tour of the Joint Security Area on the heavily fortified border between the two Koreas, becoming the first American detained in the North in nearly five years.

Developer and landlord Mirvac has swung to a $165 million loss in financial year 2023, down from a $906 million profit the year before. The loss has been driven by write-downs in the value of its office (-5.6 per cent ) and retail (-5.3 per cent ) property portfolios, partly offset by a +6.2 per cent revaluation of its industrial properties. The company also sold off about $500 million of \"non-core\" assets at a 2 per cent discount to their book values, excluding the cost of the sales. Mirvac said it would continue to increase its exposure to residential and industrial real estate, while reducing the share of office space on its books, as the persistence of working from home dents demand in that sector. Excluding one-off costs, the company's \"operating profit\" dropped 3 per cent to $580 million. It will pay a 5.3 cent per share final dividend .",

A review by ASIC has found that general insurers can, and should, improve their claims handling processes and dedicate more resources, after identifying a number of weaknesses. \"An insurance claim doesn’t have to be handled perfectly, but it must be handled well,\" ASIC deputy chair Karen Chester said. \"Our claims handling review found good practices and poor practices across all six insurers. \"We identified five areas where insurers can and should make immediate claims handling improvements — consumer communications, project management, identifying vulnerable consumers and complaints, resourcing of claims and complaints handling.\" The report was based on data from more than 200,000 claims lodged in the first three months of last year. Insurers included in the review included Suncorp, AAMI, Allianz, Budget Direct, QBE, IAG and Youi. Consumer advocates have welcomed the findings. \"The insurance process can be stressful, especially in the wake of the extreme weather events that are happening more often, and I am delighted ASIC is telling insurers they must lift their game especially for people who are vulnerable,\" Consumer Action Law Centre managing lawyer Philippa Heir said.

The company has reported a more than tripling in net profit from a year ago, to $64 million. Its revenue jumped 22 per cent to about $4.16 billion. Toll revenue lifted across the areas it operates: Sydney +31.9 per cent Melbourne +23.8 per cent Brisbane +15.5 per cent North America +22 per cent And while more cars on the roads are not good news for your commute, it's great news for Transubran. Transurban says it saw record traffic across its roads over the 2023 financial year, with a record 2.4 million trips, and it has more projects nearing completion, including Sydney's Rozelle Interchange and more roads that will connect into WestConnex. And it expects more \"traffic growth\" in the year ahead due to forecast population growth in its major markets — Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and the greater Washington area in the US. The company will pay a final dividend of 31.5 cents per share, taking its full-year payout to 58 cents, up 40 per cent. And it's already touting an increased payout for the current financial year, as it plans to hand back cash from WestConnex that it previously held onto during the construction — it expects an FY24 distribution of 62 cents per share, up 7 per cent. In other news out this morning from the toll road operator, current chief financial officer Michelle Jablko will take over the top job from mid-October. Ms Jablko joined the company in early 2021 and will take the helm from Scott Charlton, who has been running Transurban for more than a decade. The company says a new CFO will be announced in \"due course\".",
