The ABC has seen an email sent by Australian consular officials which says the border may open to some Australians at 9am local time (6pm AEDT) on Wednesday. The email urges recipients to \"seize this opportunity to depart Gaza\" if they \"deem it safe to do so\". Recipients have also been told to take enough food and water to last for at least five hours and expect large crowds. There are 88 Australians citizens, residents, and their families known to be in Gaza.

There are now an average of eight incidents per day, compared to three before the October 7 Hamas attack. ABC Middle East correspondent Allyson Horn reports from the village of Qusra in the West Bank, where some of the worst attacks happened. She spoke with Abedalazheim Al Wadi, who said his brother and nephew were gunned down by Israeli settlers, who live in the West Bank illegally according to international law. \"My brother has 11 children, his son was about to become a lawyer in a couple of weeks. He had a fiancée and was about to get married, and they kill him,\" he said. \"We live in fear and it's normal for us. Anger and depression is our daily life.\" Yael Ze'evi, who lives in an illegal Israeli outpost bordering Qusra, denies settlers in her community attack their neighbours or kill Palestinians. \"From my point of view, our lives come first. I walk around with a weapon, I have a handgun. If someone comes to me and threatens me, I won't hesitate to shoot him,\" she said. \"We don't enter their areas, we don't enter their villages.\" Footage from two weeks ago shows Israeli settlers shooting guns in Qusra. Ahed Mahmoud Owdi says his six-year-old niece was shot in the back when they escaped from their house. Three other Palestinians were killed. \"We did not provoke them, we had nothing to defend ourselves. We are peaceful. We are not even safe to go to work, we cannot leave our house safely\", he said. \"There is no safety.\" Allyson will be doing a Q & A on the blog at 6:30pm AEDT.

On a numerical basis, the number of people coming to Australia above those leaving is at a record high. Relative to the existing population, Mr Ottley says it's the highest in about five decades. \"The latest official figures show the Australian population increased by 0.7%/qtr in Q1 23 to be 2.2% higher through the year. In the March quarter, net overseas migration (NOM) increased by a record ~150,000 and the natural increase was ~29,000. In the year ending Q1 23, NOM was sitting at 454,400, a record high ,\" he observes. \"An expected further acceleration in the annual population growth rate to 2.6% in the year to Q3 23 would see population growth stronger than it was during the mining boom. You then have to go back to the 1970's post war immigration and baby boom to see a stronger rate of growth. \"In short, Australian population is growing faster than it has at any point in the past 50+ years .\" For all the discussion of filling skills shortages, CBA's graphs show that by far the biggest intake is the return of international students. So what effect is this having on the economy? It depends if you are a business owner or a worker, explains Mr Ottley, as illustrated in the yawning gap between business conditions and consumer confidence. \"The reason for this is more resilient aggregate economic activity due to more consumers in the economy has kept business conditions robust, allowing input cost growth to be passed on. At the same time, these extra consumers require housing and so rents and housing prices have risen.\" And because rents are surging and aggregate consumer demand is allowing businesses to keep passing on cost increases through higher prices, Mr Ottley argues this high population growth is inflationary, at least in the short term. \"Strong population growth is also boosting labour supply, which has helped to alleviate labour shortages across the country. This has the effect of dampening wages growth in some industries. In the medium term, this can have a cooling effect on inflation as input costs for firms (labour) is eased. \"In our view though, the nearer term impact that is more pertinent to the monetary policy outlook is that the population surge has been inflationary. The RBA broadly agrees.\"",

Ernst & Young (EY) has now been revealed as the consultancy company at the centre of an alleged tax avoidance scandal. It has been revealed as this after the company, it says, pushed for a suppression order on its name to be lifted. The Australian Tax Office (ATO) alleges a former EY partner promoted a tax exploitation scheme. The case has been lodged by the Commissioner of Taxation in the Federal Court seeking orders for a civil penalty or fine. That's basically all the ATO has confirmed, however. \"As the matter is before the courts and no findings have been made, the ATO is limited in making any further comments,\" they noted. \"The ATO has been working closely with the Tax Practitioners Board on this matter.\" EY said it asked for the suppression on its name to be lifted \"to demonstrate our commitment to transparency\", a statement from the firm said. \"The suppression orders remain in  place in respect of the identity of a number of other parties affected by the proceedings, including the  former partner,\" it added. More of EY's statement here: \"EY established the former partner acted in isolation and without the approval of EY, and contrary to the  firm's well-established policies and procedures. \"The former partner was terminated for cause in August 2022 after disclosing that they received in  excess of $700,000 in unauthorised financial benefits in connection with the client transactions subject  to the proceedings. \"These unauthorised financial benefits, received in relation to the transactions  described in the proceedings, gave EY cause for concerns about the former partner's transactions,  advice and conduct.\"",

According to Refinitiv data, markets are now pricing about a two-thirds chance of the RBA hiking next Tuesday. Bloomberg data has those odds closer to 56% for a rate hike, but also indicates that markets have almost fully priced in two more hikes by the middle of next year to take the cash rate to 4.6%, not just one and done. Expectations of longer term risk free interest rates are even higher, with the Australian 10-year bond closing in on passing 5% for the first time since 2011. The Australian 10-year bond (white line) has now punched above the US benchmark rate (blue line), as local rate expectations are now higher than those for further Federal Reserve rate hikes. The Fed is currently meeting, with the outcome to be announced tomorrow morning Australian time. The current target Fed funds rate in the US is 5.25-5.5%. The market is pricing in almost no chance of a rate rise at this meeting, and just 25% at the December meeting. It's also pricing in a slim chance of rate cuts as early as March and the likelihood of rate cuts by July next year.",
