My Optus NBN is still out, and I've given my equipment a couple of chances to restart in the last half hour - Nick Optus says it's customers should now have their internet back ,However we still have no Internet on hold with Optus😞 - Margaret Bay NBN in Brisbane is still not restored, contrary to what the Optus CEO is saying.
