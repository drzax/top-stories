That brings ANZ's two-year fixed-term mortgage from 5.99 per cent to 6.54 per cent. Macquarie has also raised its fixed rates by 0.36 percentage points, with more hikes than cuts to fixed-rate loans over the last month, according to RateCity. RateCity says the big four banks' lowest fixed-rate mortgages are mainly above 6 per cent, with just two fixed rates under 6 per cent. RateCity research director Sally Tindall: \"ANZ's fixed-rate hikes comes amid a distinct lack of competition in the fixed rate market and heat from funding pressure.\" Ms Tindall says bank customers should look at credit unions and mutuals which have fixed rates well under 6 per cent. Just 5 per cent of new and refinanced loans are fixed, compared to nearly half in July 2021 when interest rates were at record lows.",
