Wage Inspectorate Victoria alleges Woolworths and its subsidiary Woolstar underpaid 1,235 former employees their long service leave entitlements, with underpayments ranging from $250 to $12,000. The regulator alleges that Woolworths and Woolstar broke Victoria's Long Service Leave Act between 2018 and 2021. Failure to pay long service leave is a criminal offence in Victoria and attracts large fines. The case will begin in the Melbourne Magistrates' Court next month. Here's Robert Hortle, Victoria's Wage Inspectorate commissioner: \"Victorians expect businesses with significant payroll resources to get this stuff right. \"They’d be disappointed to see a household name facing underpayment allegations. \"Long service leave is a long standing, valued workplace entitlement in Victoria, and the Wage Inspectorate is here to ensure it is paid when it is owed. \"The amount of underpayment never tells the full story in long service leave matters.\" The Wage Inspectorate is also taking action against Optus, CommSec and Bank West alleging they broke the long service leave laws. In 2021, a Wage Inspectorate investigation found more than 4,000 former Coles workers in Victoria were underpaid almost $700,000 in long service leave entitlements.",
