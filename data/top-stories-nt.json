A lot of the big moves are happening in the mining sector, with gold producers up while coal miners have been amongst those leading the losses among the top 200 firms. Capricorn Metals (+5.9%), Silver Lake Resources (+4.6%) and West African Resources (+3.1%) were among the top gainers. On the flip side, New Hope (-4.3%) and Whitehaven Coal (-2.6%) were among the biggest losers. They were joined by graphite and battery materials firm Syrah Resources (-5.4%), and lithium miners Sayona Mining (-4.2%) and Mineral Resources (-3.8%). Outside of mining, IGA wholesaler and hardware firm Metcash was up 4.2% on positive profit results, while grain handler Graincorp was also up 3.3%. The electronic banking outage for the Commonwealth Bank doesn't seem to be hurting its share price much — it is down 0.7% to $97.82, but the other big banks are also off between 0.3-1.2%. The broader All Ordinaries index is down 0.4% to 7,258 points. The Australian dollar is edging up to 66.86 US cents .",
