About 5,500 of them are expected to give birth within a month. The ABC's team in Gaza met 24 year-old Lina Raad Hammas and her two-day old newborn twins. She fled northern Gaza to the south, and is now living on the concrete floor of an educational college building that's been turned into a refuge. Her house has since been destroyed by an Israeli airstrike. \"The situation is terrible,' she said. \"There is no food, no electricity, no water, especially when I've just had my baby. \"It is stressful. I even borrowed my mattress from the neighbours.\" Lina said she is yet to name her twins because she's too stressed and exhausted. She is worried her babies will die from starvation. \"I just need water for my babies,\" she said. \"I wanted to bottle feed them, but I could not clean the bottles. \"I kept breast-feeding them but I don't have enough milk for both of them.\"",

It was down around 0.8% at the open, and closed off the same amount, having traded in a pretty narrow range throughout the day. The big losers were the same by the end of the day as at the beginning — energy down 3.1%, led by coal miners, with the rest of the mining sector off an average 2.3%. The resilient sectors also remained the same: healthcare, up 1.8% and consumer non-cyclicals up 0.7%. On the ASX 200, 124 companies lost ground while only 61 finished in the black, with 15 going neither up nor down.

The private health insurer says the trial, designed with 4 Day Week Global and monitored by Macquarie University, is part of their wider commitment to be \"the healthiest workplace in Australia\". Workers involved in Medibank's trial will experiment with the 100:80:100 model — where employees and bosses agree to 100% of their previous pay, for 80% of the work time, while committing to 100% productivity. For full-time Medibank employees, it means they only work four days a week, while part-time employees are pro-rated. \"There are lots of pressures out there right now, whether it's cost of living or people managing their work and home commitments,\" Medibank's Kylie Bishop said. \"We're constantly thinking about how we can help balance that for our people and invest in their health and wellbeing to help prevent issues like burnout.\" Medibank's four-day week trial comes as Unilever, which makes consumer goods like Rexona, Streets and Dove, is about to wind down its year-long trial next month that around 500 employees took part in.
