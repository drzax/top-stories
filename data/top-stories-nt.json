              "plaintext": "By Declan Bowring, ABC Radio Sydney A Sydney-based Palestinian with family in Gaza says it's a matter of life and death for her relatives. Ramia Abdo Sultan told ABC Radio Sydney Mornings she had relatives sheltering at a UN-run school, which was taking 6,000 people despite only having capacity for 1,500 people. She says food is also scarce, with people at the shelter receiving three loaves of bread and three cups of water a day. \"In my lifetime, for all I've known it, I've never seen this unfold,\" Ms Abdo Sultan said. \"It's a situation of literally life or death for many who are surviving the massacre.\" Ms Abdo Sultan said she has patchy contact with her relatives who need to find solar-generated power to charge their phones. Ms Abdo Sultan says Australians who can leave Gaza have tried to exit through the Rafa crossing into Egypt but have not been able to get through multiple times. \"They've tried multiple times to leave … only to wait a couple of hours and to be left with no option but to return,\" Ms Abdo Sultan said. \"They feel like they have not had the same level of support and attention that anyone else around the world would have otherwise had.\"",

It's the first time any of the big four banks has cuts rates on a savings account during this time. It means existing customers who have had their account for more than three months will now be earning just 1.5% on any deposits. Sally Tindall from comparison website RateCity says its database shows more banks are now cutting rates than hiking them. In the past two months, 14% of banks have cut as least one savings rate. \"The cash rate has risen by 4 percentage points in the last year and a half. If the RBA moves in the next few months, it is likely to be up, not down, and yet, ANZ is cutting the ongoing Online Saver rate from a paltry 1.6% to an even more ridiculous 1.5%,\" she said. She says the big four banks' online saver rates are low. \"At a time when every dollar makes a difference, customers should make sure their savings rate starts with a '5' not a '1'.\"",
