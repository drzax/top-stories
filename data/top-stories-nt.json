The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) alleges Qantas advertised and sold tickets for thousands of flights that it had already cancelled but not removed from sale. It alleges Qantas sold tickets for flights that were scheduled to depart between May and July 2022, but which had been cancelled, and that it kept selling tickets for those flights on its website for an average of more than two weeks, and in some cases for more than a month. It also alleges that, for more than 10,000 flights set to take off between May and July 2022, the airline failed to notify ticketholders that their flights had been cancelled for an average of 18 days. Qantas said the period of time that the ACCC’s claims relate to was one of well-publicised upheaval and \nuncertainty across the aviation industry. \"We openly acknowledges \"that our service standards fell well short and we sincerely apologise. We have worked hard to fix them since \nand that work continues,\" the airline said in the statement on Monday. \"The ACCC’s allegations come at a time when Qantas’ reputation has already been hit hard on several fronts\". \"We want the community to know that we hear and understand their disappointment. We know that the only \nway to fix it is by delivering consistently. We know it will take time to repair. And we are absolutely determined \nto do that.\"",
