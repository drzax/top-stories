That comes after record half-year production of 91.3 million barrels of oil equivalent, and despite a fall in oil prices. Investors get an interim dividend of $US0.80 a share, down 27 per cent from the same time last year. Woodside says development of its major growth project, Scarborough, off the north-west coast of WA, is nearly 40 per cent complete.

We know we must do better and are resolved to strive for a return to leading safety performance.\"",
