The independent senator said she was opposed to the Voice being used as \"window dressing\" for Indigenous recognition in the constitution, which she views as insufficient to address Australia's colonial history.

Speaking at a press conference, Ms Finocchiaro says her party, the Country Liberals, is preparing policies for the 2024 NT election to help \"re-empower\" the NT's remote communities, through \"restoring community control of local government\". \"A CLP government that I lead is very committed to Aboriginal people living in the bush, in restoring, literally, their voice to our parliament,\" she said. \"Local government reform is critical, and so we're out engaging … about how we can reshape local government to give back that decision-making and that voice in our remote communities.\" At a Yes campaign on Wednesday in Alice Springs, Chief Minister Natasha Fyles criticised Ms Finocchiaro's council plan, and said she was \"simply making excuses\" for voting against a Voice.",

              "plaintext": "One of Australia’s biggest coal miners is facing an investor backlash over its plans to buy two massive mines from BHP. London-based hedge fund Bell Rock Capital Management this morning has launched a campaign to thwart Whitehaven Coal from purchasing the two Queensland operations for a reputed $US5 billion. It will attempt to mobilise shareholders to protest the purchase by voting against the executive pay deals up before the Whitehaven annual meeting in a fortnight. BHP has been steadily reducing its coal exposure with a view to a complete exit and in recent months has been in negotiations with Whitehaven to purchase the Daunia and Blackwater mines in central Queensland. Both mines are jointly owned by BHP and Mitsubishi and have been on the market since February. The London-based investor has kicked off the campaign this morning with letters to all Whitehaven shareholders and an advertising blitz in major newspapers. Bell Rock, which owns close to 5 per cent of Whitehaven, is incensed that a key hurdle for executive bonuses has been removed from this year’s AGM agenda which it claims will encourage Whitehaven executives to pursue growth via acquisitions at the expense of shareholder returns. The proposed mine purchases are likely to cost Whitehaven almost as much as the company is worth and will need to be funded by a massive increase in debt. While the Daunia mine produces metallurgical coal for steelmaking, a large portion of Blackwater’s output is thermal coal, the demand for which is declining as efforts to battle climate change escalate.",
