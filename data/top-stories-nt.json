This time, however, the warning included language telling Gaza's residents they could be identified as \"an accomplice in a terrorist organisation\" if they chose to stay. The message was delivered via leaflets written in Arabic and marked with the IDF name and logo, as well as by audio messages sent to mobile phones across Gaza yesterday. The Reuters news agency translated the message as: \"Urgent warning, to residents of Gaza. Your presence north of Wadi Gaza [a stream running through the Gaza Valley] puts your life in danger. Whoever chooses not to leave north Gaza to the south of Wadi Gaza might be identified as an accomplice in a terrorist organisation.\" Israel's military later attempted to clarify the message, writing on Twitter that the translation which had made its way across the internet was \"imprecise\", and the IDF \"has no intention of considering those who have yet to evacuate as a member of a terrorist group\". \"The IDF states, once again, for the safety of Gazan civilians, that they should evacuate to the south of Wadi Gaza. All those who remain are endangering themselves due to the Hamas' terrorist activities within civilian areas,\" it wrote.",
