As of 3:15pm AEST, its stocks were down 33% — more than double the next worst performer, the A2 Milk Company. So what's the reason for its big fall today? It's all thanks to the tech company missing its earnings estimates. Iress posted a half-year net loss of $139.8 million, while its underlying net profit after tax was down almost a third to $24.4 million. And the company isn't expecting big changes in their second-half either, saying it expects \"softening revenue growth and cost pressures\" and has lowered its expectations accordingly. The company says the reason for its losses comes back to cost pressures, namely: increases in tech infrastructure, market data, and inflationary salary costs. Iress has also suspended its interim dividend. As for how bad their share price has been affected by the news? At one point, it fell to a 10-year low of $6.60 a share before picking back up in the middle of the day, but is now trading around th e $6.70 mark .",

Elders previously had been forecasting a guidance range of $180-200 million. The company says the reason for the downgrade comes down to: lower than forecast rural product sales in recent weeks greater than forecast pressure on rural product gross margin, especially with crop protection products further weakness in cattle and sheep prices Elders also notes \"cautious customer sentiment\" in some farming regions due to uncertain weather. \"This uncertainty is now supported by the Bureau of Meteorology's long-range forecast for September to November which predicts a heightened probability of warmer and drier than average conditions in eastern and western parts of Australia and risk of an El Nino declaration,\" the statement to the ASX read. Elders also expects some variables will influence their financial outcomes ahead of September 30, including: Commodity prices Changes in value and volume of internationally traded livestock and fibre Unexpected and unforecast changes to seasons and severe weather events Potentia l supply chain disruptions, including geopolitical events General outlook and prosperity of the Australian farming sector",
