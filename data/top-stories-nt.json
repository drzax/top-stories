Workers have been arguing for better pay and rostering and had threatened to start intermittent strike action from today. But talks continue, with workers at Gorgon, Australia's second largest LNG plant, and its Wheatstone operations voting to delay any work stoppages until 6am tomorrow. The ongoing dispute which made headlines a few of weeks ago, along with Woodside workers who were also threatening to walk off the job, sent the global price of LNG soaring. Australia is the world's biggest exporter of LNG, mostly supplying customers in Asia like China, Japan and South Korea. But of course these things ripple when we're talking global markets, so the threat of industrial action by workers in Western Australia impacts prices in Europe and elsewhere. The strike action could disrupt seven per cent of the global supply of LNG. Chevron has reportedly made provisions if workers do indeed down tools. Workers at Woodside's North West Shelf reached an agreement in late August, that guarantees total pay packets of more than $300,000 a year .",

Before we hear from Philip Lowe for the last time, I thought I'd jump in with a bit more on another leadership change. No, not Qantas. That other, other leadership change that's made headlines recently. Remember last week when Andrew Forrest announced the chief executive of Fortescue Metals Group, Fiona Hick was out and Dino Otranto was now in the top job - on the same morning the top 10 ASX listed company was due to reveal it's full year results? On that day, they held their media and analyst briefing before they even published their annual results to the market (because there was a whole lot of name replacing going on in the documents) - it made for an engaging call that morning. By the way, Ms Hick is not the only exit - hardly a day has gone by since last Monday where another FMG high level executive or staffer hasn't left. But looking forward, Mr Otranto (title now CEO FMG Metals) and Mark Hutchison (CEO FMG Energy) have now held another briefing with analysts and our good friends at UBS have sent over a note from that discussion. The note from UBS analysts Lachlan Shaw, Levi Spry and Dim Ariyasinghe says: FMG explained that while former CEO Fiona Hick and CFO Christine Milne were highly regarded, the fit had not worked. A quick response was seen as in the best interests of shareholders and governance. Recent leadership changes reflected that the Board had decided the 'fit' of former CEO Fiona Hick and CFO Christine Milne was off, and saw fit from a governance perspective to move quickly to address. Management stability vs FMG's agile/ can-do decision making culture was taken into account. Until recently, FMG had allocated 10 per cent of its net profit after tax to be spent on Fortescue Future Industries projects. That has been removed, along with it the certainty of how much of the iron ore profits would be spent developing decarbonisation technologies. Mr Hutchison has been tasked with delivering five projects by the end of this year. I was chatting with a former FMG insider recently, who said even delivering one is a big ask. So I guess... watch this space. But back to the UBS, note. The analyst team's guidance is to sell FMG shares. We remain sell rated with $15.20/sh PT reflecting near term iron ore price caution on China steel production caps, and uncertainty on Energy project economics and execution risks. Fortescue shares are down slightly today - fetching about $20.33 .",

              "plaintext": "ANZ has increased interest rates on all but one of its credit cards by 0.25 percentage points overnight. Customers with the ANZ Low Rate card will see a 1.25 percentage point increase, taking the interest rate to 13.74%. All credit cards with ANZ are also seeing a 0.75 percentage point increase to its cash advance and balance transfer rates — taking it from 21.24% to 21.99%. The annual fees on three ANZ cards will also increase from November 8 — its Rewards Platinum, Rewards, and Rewards Travel. Here's a breakdown of the interest rate changes on ANZ's credit cards, courtesy of RateCity: Low Rate: +1.25% to 13.74% (Annual fee: $0 for 1 year then $58) First: +0.25% to 20.49% (Annual fee: $0 for 1 year then $30) Platinum: +0.25% to 20.49% (Annual fee: $0 for 1 year then $87, or free if spend +$20K yearly) Rewards Platinum: +0.25% to 20.49% (Annual fee: $95 — increasing to $149 on November 8) Frequent Flyer Platinum: +0.25% to 20.49% (Annual fee: $425) Rewards Black: +0.25% to 20.49% (Annual fee: $375) Frequent Flyer Black: +0.25% to 20.49% (Annual fee: $425) Sally Tindall, RateCity.com.au's research director said the credit card fees were hiked by ANZ \"in the dead of night\". \"For some ANZ card holders, this rate rise could pass them by if they’re not paying attention,\" she said. \"In the last six months we’ve seen 10 lenders hike the rates on at least one of their credit cards, while seven lenders have increased annual fees. \"This is yet another timely reminder to give your credit card a health check regardless of who the provider is.\"",
