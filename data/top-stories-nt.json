The biggest drag on the market was the consumer non-cyclicals sector, with hotels operator Endeavour Group slumping 10.3% to $5.615. The fall for Endeavour appears related to changes announced by the Victorian government to lower poker machine pre-commitment caps to $100 a day, and close pokies in clubs between 4am-10am. Healthcare, financial and technology were the sectors in the black, with Medibank Private jumping 2.8% to $3.445. Resmed, Polynovo and Sonic Healthcare were also among the ASX 200's top ten gains so far today. The Australian dollar is also down very slightly by 0.1% to 68.32 US cents .",
