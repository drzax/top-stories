As Gareth has mentioned, some economists still think there's a red-hot chance of another hike or two coming our way from the central bank — but we will get a better picture when we get inflation data next Wednesday. Taking a look at the sectors, technology is the best performer, up 0.4%, with real estate close behind at 0.3%. Financials and consumer non-cyclicals are also up 0.1% each, while the rest of the sectors are in the red, with industrials and healthcare down 0.5% each. The top five performers so far: Mineral Resources +4.9% Flight Centre +4.1% Megaport +3.6% Ampol +2.9% Lendlease +2.9% And the worst performers so far today: Telix Pharmaceuticals -13.4% Northern Star Resources -5.4% Sayona Mining -2.8% BrainChip Holdings -2.5% Boral -2.3%",

It's now sitting at 66.8% — and Sally Auld from JBWere says it would be a reason why we've seen a drop in the unemployment rate. \"The  participation rate measures the  number of people who are either  employed or actively looking for a job and the fact that was down 0.1% might have meant that in a month  where job demand or labour demand  was obviously pretty strong it  helped to push the unemployment rate lower,\" she said. \"But I wouldn't get obsessed  with small moves either way in the participation rate. \"I think the main thing is here is despite what we've seen, some of the softening of the leading indicators, the numbers are telling us the labour market remains very tight and very strong .\"",
