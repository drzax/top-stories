It came at a critical time, and signalled the beginning of the end for India. So now the Aussie top order will return to the crease looking to take the game away from India. They could happily bat for a day or more now to make it a sure thing, but on a tricky pitch that is no foregone conclusion. Big hour coming up before tea.",
