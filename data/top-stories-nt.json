Three of the big four banks are now predicting another interest rate rise when the RBA board meets tomorrow, expecting a 0.25 percentage point increase to 4.35%. The Commonwealth Bank is the only bank that isn't expecting the RBA to hike rates again tomorrow. Former RBA board member Warwick McKibbin told RN Breakfast the market needs time to respond to the rate hikes. \"Suppose we are getting a supply shock which is pushing inflation down and we keep raising interest rates we could quite easily overshoot on the downside because the response to the interest rate policies is about 6-12 months so you could make things a lot worse next year,\" he said. Mr McKibbin also says he wants to see the federal government to do more to ease inflation, in particular policies to boost productivity. \"I think what the government said before the election, I fully agreed with their productivity agenda, bringing women into the labour force etc, helping with childcare but what's been delivered so far has been very disappointing,\" he said.",

Let's get the obvious out of the way first — a new month means a new interest rate decision is squarely front of mind for the Reserve Bank of Australia. At the moment, it's looking like it could go either way, but earlier this morning markets were pricing the likelihood of a rate rise at 69%. But it's not just markets that think a hike might be on the cards — NAB and Westpac are both expecting a 0.25 percentage point rise tomorrow, which would take the cash rate to 4.35%. That's despite inflation coming down. Here's Westpac said in its thinking, which it sent out on Friday: \"With core inflation holding above 6% ; the unemployment rate holding nearly 1 [percentage point] below the NAIRU (RBA’s estimate) and the cash rate only around 1 [percentage point] into contractionary territory (we see neutral around 3%) the cash rate will need to go higher .\" Another factor that the RBA will be taking into consideration? Property prices. CoreLogic data shows they're continuing to rebound, with home prices rising by 1.1% across the nation last month, on average. Sydney is leading the gains with a 1.7% rise, while Brisbane rose 1.3%, and Peth and Adelaide were up 0.9% each. The only place where property prices fell? Hobart — they were down 0.3%. Meanwhile on the market front, we can expect the ASX to open higher, off the SPI futures trending higher. All that said, it's the first (business) day of the new financial year, so let's see what's in store.",
