While the headline national vacancy rate remained steady at a low 1.2% in May, the vacancy rate in Sydney rose to 1.5%. Vacancy rates in Melbourne (1.2%), Brisbane (1%), Adelaide (0.6%), Perth (0.6%), Canberra (2%) and Hobart (1.6%) were all quite stable, says SQM. However, perhaps surprisingly given the return of hundreds of thousands of international students, vacancy rates in the Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane CBDs increased rapidly to 5.1%, 3.7% and 2% respectively, according to the data. SQM also noted that the majority of regional markets also recorded fairly stable vacancy rates last month, although many are off the extreme low vacancy rates seen recently. \"While there has been some easing in rental conditions, especially in regional Australia, it is still very much a landlord's market for most capital cities,\" said SQM's managing director Louis Christopher. \"We note though the recent increases in CBD rental vacancy rates. Especially for the Sydney CBD. We will keep noting such areas so tenants can continue to understand areas that may now be experiencing relatively less rental stress.\"",

Major miners are doing the heavy lifting, with BHP (+2.5%) and Fortescue (+2.9%) rising substantially. On the flipside, CSL shares have dropped sharply — down 7.9 per cent, dragging the health care sector with them. The biotech firm earlier flagged a bigger profit hit from foreign currency exchange rates than previously forecast. RBC Capital Markets analyst Craig Wong-Pan said CSL's update was disappointing in terms of its guidance for the next financial year. In the retail sector, Myer shares are down by 4 per cent, which may have something to do with a drop in sales at rival David Jones, as reported by The Australian. Elsewhere in the sector, retailers are mostly higher including Harvey Norman (+0.5%), Premier Investments (+0.9%) and JB Hi-Fi (+1%).",
