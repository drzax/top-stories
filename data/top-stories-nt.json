Local television station Fox 35 says more than a dozen popular rides at the Orlando theme park were closed after the bear was sighted in a tree, including the Haunted Mansion and Pirates of the Caribbean rides. Lisa Thompson, a spokesperson for the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, said in a statement that the bear was likely searching for food in the area. \"During the fall, bears are more active as they search for food to pack on fat reserves for the winter,\" she said. \"In most cases, it is best for bears to be given space and to move along on their own. \"But given this situation, staff have captured the animal and are relocating the bear out of the park to an area in or around the Ocala National Forest.\"",

                "plaintext": "An unusually well-preserved dinosaur skeleton named \"Barry\" is expected to fetch up to 1.2 million euros ($2.1 million) at a Paris auction next month. The 150 million-year-old Camptosaurus was discovered in the 1990s in the US state of Wyoming. It was named after palaeontologist Barry James who first restored it in 2000. Italian laboratory Zoic, which acquired \"Barry\" last year, has done further restoration work on the skeleton. Alexandrew Giquello, from the auction house Hotel Drouot, says it is unusual to see a dinosaur skeleton so intact. \"To take the example of its skull, the skull is complete at 90 per cent and the rest of the dinosaur is complete at 80 per cent,\" he says. Giquello says dinosaur specimens on the art market remain rare, with no more than a couple of sales a year worldwide.",

Angus Hines from the Bureau of Meteorology says Wednesday will be hotter at 34C, and that parts of South Australia and Queensland will also feel the heat. \"Most of Australia is sitting at moderate or high fire [danger] for the next few days,\" he says. \"The south coast of NSW has a small area of extreme fire danger there, overlapping with the heatwave conditions on Tuesday.\" It's the first total fire ban for Greater Sydney since late 2020, NSW Rural Fire Service (RFS) spokesman Ben Shepherd says. The NSW Education Department has listed 20 schools that will be closed across the state's south coast today. The fire ban and school closures apply across areas that include the Bega Valley and Eurobodalla Shire. RFS Commissioner Rob Rogers says people need to be prepared. \"It's the worst risk we've faced since the Black Summer fires of 2019,\" he says. The heat is expected to shift north later in the week into parts of Queensland, the Northern Territory and Western Australia, driving maximums to 40C .",
