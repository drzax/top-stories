The US should have enough cash stashed through emergency measures to pay its bills this week, but so-called X day, when the money runs out, looms as early as potentially next week (with estimates ranging from June 1 on), so markets will be hoping Democrat and Republican negotiators make some progress. That's likely to be easier now that Joe Biden will be present for the talks — his absence at the G7 seemed to stall things, so it's probably for the best he cancelled his trip Down Under this week. Things didn't go so well on Friday, with Republican house speaker Kevin McCarthy walking out on the talks amid a continued lack of agreement on spending cuts. \"Over the weekend McCarthy said that the impasse was unlikely to be resolved while the president was still overseas,\" noted NAB's Rodrigo Catril. \"Then late on Sunday, the two parties agreed to resume talks (have we not seen this movie before?) with President Biden and McCarthy set to meet on Monday. \"Speaking over the weekend and adding urgency for a resolution, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said the US is unlikely to reach mid-June and still be able to pay its bills.\" Staffers have been talking over the weekend and Biden and McCarthy chatted on the phone in what's being reported as a more positive conversation, but the positions are still some way apart. If you're not up to speed with the US government debt ceiling and what's at stake if it isn't raised before the June deadline, my colleague Kate Ainsworth will get you there with her explainer:",
