              "plaintext": "By Brad Ryan in Washington DC There are plenty of unanswered questions about the origins of a court document â dismissed by a court as \"fictitious \" â which lists new charges against Donald Trump. As we reported earlier, Reuters published a copy of the document, saying it had briefly appeared on the website of Georgia's Fulton County court, before the court's clerk said it wasn't genuine. Fulton County â Georgia's largest county â is where a grand jury is currently considering whether to indict the president on alleged election interference attempts. In a statement released a short time ago, Trump lawyers Drew Findling and Jennifer Little say: \"The Fulton County District Attorney's Office has once again shown that they have no respect for the integrity of the grand jury process. This was not a simple administrative mistake. \"A proposed indictment should only be in the hands of the District Attorney's Office, yet it somehow made its way to the clerk's office and was assigned a case number and a judge before the grand jury even deliberated. \"This is emblematic of the pervasive and glaring constitutional violations which have plagued this case from its very inception.\" It's now almost 6pm in Georgia, but the grand jury remains in the courtroom. That could â but doesnât necessarily â mean an after-hours indictment is coming tonight. \"I guess you'll have to wait and see,\" Judge Robert McBurney told reporters at the court, according to the New York Times.",
