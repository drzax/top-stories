At one venue in the CBD, everyone who spoke to the ABC said they were voting yes. Michael Morrow said while he was originally planning to vote no, some of the \"aggressive\" campaigning \"kind of put me off a little bit\". \"I just thought about and decided vote yes,\" he said. He said he chatted to family about the referendum, but his decision was personal and \"wasn't really influenced by anybody else\". \"If it can help out, might as well [vote yes],\" he said. Fiona Futo said she voted a \"definite yes\" and held back tears as she spoke, saying she felt \"a little bit emotional about it\". \"I just think Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people have really suffered a lot … just anything we can do to help make things better, I definitely want to support that ,\" she said. She said while she was unsure exactly how the Voice to Parliament would work, she trusted elected officials. \"It is quite confusing, but I don't know what happens in Parliament House, I don't know how our day-to-day decisions are made and all the processes that happen in government but I just trust that our elected government does know how all that works and that they have made a plan of how the Voice is going to work,\" she said. \"And I don't need to worry about that, I just need to know about whether or not I want to do the right thing to support Aboriginal people.\"",

Senator Thorpe told RN's Patricia Karvelas that she believes the referendum \"gave platform for the racists\". \"The racism we've seen, the far-right Nazis coming out. All the bad behaviour from a lot of sections of our country, is part of an illness in this country that needs to be healed,\" she said. \"This is the government’s fault, this is Anthony Albanese’s fault we're seeing a rise in racism, we're seeing families split, we've seen communities divided.\" \"We should never have gone to this referendum in the first place.\" Listen to the full interview below.",

The head of Australia's domestic spy agency ASIO has warned the conflict between Israel and Gaza is \"resonating in the Australian community\", although the local terror threat is unchanged. Director-General Mike Burgess has issued a rare public statement in the wake of fiery protests across Australia, noting such activity will continue \"and are likely to feature strong emotive claims.\" He says ASIO is carefully monitoring the situation along with police. \"I remain concerned about the potential for opportunistic violence with little or no warning,\" Mr Burgess said. \"However, it is important to distinguish opportunistic violence from planned violence or acts of terrorism. \"ASIO remains well-placed to detect threats to security including potential acts of politically motivated violence or the promotion of communal violence.\" Mr Burgess also urged people taking part in protests, and commenting on them, to be careful about the tone they strike – noting that \"words matter\". \"It is important that all parties consider the implications for social cohesion when making public statements. \"ASIO has seen direct connections between inflamed language and inflamed community tensions. \"As always, ASIO is not interested in those who are engaged in lawful protest, but rather the small subset of protesters who may wish to escalate protest to violence—this includes religiously motivated and ideologically motivated extremists, or anyone who believes that violence is a means to further their own interests.\"",

'Bad apples' The clear difference between the new CEO of PwC Australia — imported from Singapore in recent months — is the willingness to blame former leaders for wrongdoing. Repeatedly, Kevin Burrowes laid the blame for failings on former CEOs Luke Sayers (2012-2020) and Tom Seymour (2020-2023). Mr Seymour did not appear before the hearings today. Greens senator Barbara Pocock put it to the current CEO that it was bad leadership, forming a certain culture, that led to bad outcomes. POCOCK: \"Switkowski's main finding is that the PwC scandal arose because of the firm's pursuit of revenue at any cost, a 'whatever it takes' culture, and a system in relation to revenue putting profit above ethics. While a small number of bad apples have been sacrificed or suffered a penalty of some form, the system persists... none of the proposed measures will fix the problem. They're window dressing. They exhort people to behave ethically, when the overwhelming requirement of the business model is to chase the business to make revenue. How do you propose to change your business model? BURROWES (New CEO): \"I would agree with your characterization of the firm historically, certainly. I think that's clear. And we need to change because that's not acceptable. It's not the way we should be doing business.\" Mr Sayers apologised overall but specifically blamed \"a number of bad actor tax partners, bad actor tax partners that behaviourally made the wrong choices\" who had shared confidential information. Misled? A persistent line of questioning — and a future headache for the firm — was about a plan to sell the business. The idea was created by former PwC boss Luke Sayers sometime around 2017-19 to spin-off the Australian, New Zealand and some of the Asian-based management consulting arms of the firm. The plan was advanced enough that Mr Sayers travelled to the US to push the idea, with a mooted figure he couldn't recall but was noted in the inquiry to be $1 billion. The deal never came off. The reason for the questions was only revealed by Labor senator Deborah O'Neill at the end of the hearing. Around the time of the deal, the Senate had been examining audits and consulting firms. A PwC Australia submission pushing back on the idea of 'structurally separating' the audit and consulting businesses rubbished it as unworkable and impossible. But according to responses today, at the same time Mr Sayers and PwC Australia were actively shopping this idea. If proven, it would mean PwC staff were saying one thing to the Senate and an entirely different thing to the market ...",

Hi Justin - great question. Bank of Queensland put out results yesterday - which I suspect may be why you've sent through your question. It posted a 70 per cent fall in profit for the year and its shares yesterday lost as much as 5.5 per cent. I had a quick scan in my inbox through some of the notes analysts have sent me. Citi has increased its position from 'sell' to 'neutral' since those results. Its research team wrote: \"It gets worse before it gets better. We forecast low single digit asset growth in FY24, a trough NIM in 1H24 and cost growth of 6%. This sees core earnings trough in 1H24 before lending momentum stabilises. \"An earlier trough, we upgrade to Neutral. With this result, we think management have reset expectations for the more difficult FY24. \"We continue to see management's targets as a bridge too far, and too optimistic on revenues. Nevertheless, the work on costs likely puts a floor under the earnings, and consequently the stock, and so we upgrade to Neutral.\" BOQ shares are reversing some of yesterday's losses today, up 3.83% to $5.55.",

Ryley Sanders is a big-bodied workhorse in midfield who dominated his under-18 year with his combination of inside grunt and outside skill. The Larke Medallist teamed up with Colby McKercher to lead the Allies to victory in the state champs and enjoyed a fantastic season with the Sandringham Dragons. He proved a commanding presence in midfield, a real leader of both sides, and quickly became a favourite among draft watchers. It's a stretch to say he plays like him, but with the blonde hair and pulled-up socks he does genuinely look like Jason Horne-Francis when he plays. He doesn't have the explosive athleticism of Horne-Francis, but he does move a bit like him and makes up for that lack of top-level pace with a fantastic work ethic. He's a little more one-paced than someone like McKercher, but he's quick enough. And when he's frame fills out further he could well be a force for any AFL midfield. North Melbourne are big fans and tried to get the AFL to let them have priority access to him via their NGA, but Sanders is available to all and sundry on the open market.",
