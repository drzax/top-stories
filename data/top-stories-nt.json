OPEC+ (which groups the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and allies led by Russia) has already been cutting supply to boost prices since November last year due to weaker Chinese demand and rising US supply. Despite that, it has failed to move oil prices outside a range of $US70 - $US80 a barrel. Saudi Arabia said it would extend its voluntary oil output cut of 1 million barrels per day (bpd) for another month to include August, adding that the cut could be extended beyond that month. Shortly after the Saudi announcement, Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak said Moscow would cut its oil exports by 500,000 barrels per day in August. The cuts amount to 1.5% of global supply and bring the total pledged by OPEC+ to 5.16 million bpd. OPEC+, which pumps around 40% of the world's crude oil, already has in place cuts of 3.66 million bpd. This amounts to 3.6% of global demand (including 2 million bpd agreed last year and voluntary cuts of 1.66 million bpd agreed in April and extended to December 2024). Brent crude futures were up 0.4% to $US75 a barrel.",

It also expects to spend more than $100 million in trasitional \"employment and operational costs\". The new entity will be called Scyne Advisory, and have around 1,750 ex-PwC staff. In a statement, Allegro said the new business will be \"fully independent\" of PwC. In recent months, PwC has been caught up in a damaging tax scandal. It led to eight senior partners being forced out, government departments refusing to extend their consulting contracts with the firm, and its senior management being grilled before Senate inquiries. The scandal involved a senior partner using secret information it obtained from the government (while advising it on on how to increase the tax paid by multinational companies), working out a loophole to get around them, and selling the plan to those companies, making millions of dollars in fees. Some commentors have compared PwC's conduct as simliar to a 'double agent'. \"Scyne Advisory will establish an independent Board of Directors to oversee a rigorous, ASX-standard of governance and integrity in the business,\" Allegro said. To allay concerns about the integrity of the new business, Allegro has hired former Federal Court judge Andrew Greenwood to join the board as a non-executive director. Mr Greenwood will chair an ethics subcommittee to check on the probity of employees joining Scyne Advisory, as well as future conflicts and code of conduct. Allegro said it expects the deal to be finalised by the end of August.",
