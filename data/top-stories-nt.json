The Gold Coast man, 45, has been charged with 136 counts of rape and 110 counts of sexual intercourse with a child under 10. AFP Assistant Commissioner Justine Gough says the AFP and its partner agencies never gave up trying to identify the alleged offender and the children involved. \"Given there were so many alleged images and videos of children recorded over 15 years on the alleged offender's devices, the process of identification took time, skill and determination,\" she says. \"While I am extremely proud of law enforcements' persistence and their unwavering dedication to identify this alleged offender, and stop further abuse, this is chilling news. \"It is with a heavy heart that the AFP and other law enforcement dedicate so much time and resources to prevent and take action against individuals who commit heinous crimes against children. \"There is not much solace I can give parents and children who have been identified under Operation Tenterfield, but I can tell you that we never gave up, and we never will when it comes to protecting children. \"This is a distressing time for families, carers and the community broadly.\" You can read more on this story at the link below.

After leaving rates on hold at 4.1% in July, the cash rate is currently the highest it's been since April 2012. Should the RBA lift interest rates by 0.25 percentage points at 2:30pm AEST, it would be take the cash rate to 4.35%, and would make it the highest rate since November 2011 (which is more than 11 and a half years ago). Here's the history of the cash rate since 1990. As you can see, when we look at the data from more than 30 years, the recent rate hikes are incredibly steep compared to past increases.",
