Applications per job increased by 6.5 per cent in August. That continues the trend we've been seeing for awhile after job ads peaked at record highs last year. More migration and a slowing economy means employers have more workers to chose from. Here's Seek managing director Kendra Banks: “After a slight rise in July, job ads declined 1.8 per cent in August driven by a drop in volumes in New South Wales. “Victoria and the Northern Territory were the only states to buck the trend, with regional job ad volumes in Victoria driving overall job ads up for the state, particularly those in retail & consumer products. \"Ads for retail & consumer products roles rose nationally for the second month, as businesses begin preparing for the Christmas season.\" “Applications per job ad continue to rise, and after six months of growth, levels are now higher than they were in July 2019, demonstrating that competition for jobs is greater than it was pre-COVID.\" However, demand for labour is still strong with the unemployment near fifty year lows of 3.7 per cent in July. Hospitality and tourism job ads were down by 3.1 per cent in August and they are down by nearly 41 per cent over the year, which suggests new migrants and international students are filling more of these jobs.",

The rise of 0.4 per cent over the June quarter, matched a 0.4 per cent increase over the March quarter. However growth pulled back over the year to June with the economy expanding by 2.1 per cent. Here's what Mr Chalmers had to say: \"The Australian economy remains steady and sturdy in the face of unrelenting pressure.\" \"Economic growth held up well despite the inevitable toll of higher interest rates, moderating inflation and continuing global uncertainty particularly as it relates to China.\" \"We know that there are challenges ahead but we face them from a position of relative strength.\" Mr Chalmers noted that the high cost of living is weighing on consumers with housing spending growing by just 0.1 per cent over the quarter. \"Australians continue to pull back on discretionary spending to make room for essentials and also to cover mortgage repayments.\" \"People are also spending less on renovating their homes and are saving less out of their incomes.\" \"We expect the economy to slow considerably over the next year and we expect the unemployment rate to tick up as well.\"",

He says the results were \"stronger than expected\" despite the weaker growth in household spending, but it \" highlights the tensions that continue to exist between monetary and fiscal policy settings in Australia \". Here's his full take on the figures and their meaning: \"National GDP grew by 0.4% in the June quarter, or a touch above the 0.3% gain expected by the market. Over the past twelve months, the economy has posted modestly below trend growth of 2.1%. \"Yet within the national accounts, household consumer spending grew by a mere 0.1% in the June quarter, to be up only 1.5% over the past year. Higher interest rates, courtesy of the RBA, are certainly doing their part in slowing down the consumer, which is a big chunk (50%) of the economy. \"Higher interest rates, along with ongoing labour and material shortages, have also helped slow housing construction, which fell 0.2% in the quarter and by 1.1% over the past year. \"Yet countering this effect has been strength in public demand. In particular, new public investment spending rose by 5.5% in the quarter, which as the ABS notes, reflects \"ongoing large-scale transport, health and education projects across a number of states .\" Indeed, major public infrastructure programs are also likely contributing to the labour and material shortages in the housing sector — adding to inflationary pressure and \"crowding out\" much needed growth in housing supply. \"While federal and state government commitment to infrastructure programs is usually a welcome development, the present timing of this public investment boom is unfortunate – as it runs contrary to the RBA's efforts to slow the economy and bring down inflation. \"All that said, today's stronger than expected GDP report is not expected to change the outlook for the RBA just yet .\"",
