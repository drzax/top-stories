The latest reading on CPI inflation indicates that while goods price inflation has eased further, the prices of many services are continuing to rise briskly. While the central forecast is for CPI inflation to continue to decline, progress looks to be slower than earlier expected. CPI inflation is now expected to be around 3.5 per cent by the end of 2024 and at the top of the target range of 2 to 3 per cent by the end of 2025. The Board judged an increase in interest rates was warranted today to be more assured that inflation would return to target in a reasonable timeframe. Ms Bullock also said the RBA may need to increase rates further, however \"whether further tightening of monetary policy is required to ensure that inflation returns to target in a reasonable timeframe will depend upon the data and the evolving assessment of risks .\"",

              "plaintext": "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says that Israel would consider \"tactical little pauses\" in the fighting in Gaza to facilitate the entry of humanitarian aid or allow the exit of hostages held by Hamas militants. But the Israeli leader reiterated his country's rejection of a ceasefire without the release of all people being held captive in the Hamas-ruled Palestinian enclave. Mr Netanyahu made the comments in an interview with the US ABC News. \"Well, there'll be no ceasefire, no general ceasefire in Gaza without the release of our hostages,\" he said. \"As far as tactical little pauses — an hour here, an hour there — we've had them before. \"I suppose we'll check the circumstances, in order to enable goods, humanitarian goods, to come in, or our hostages, individual hostages, to leave.\" He was also asked who should govern Gaza after fighting is over. \"I think Israel will for an indefinite period ... have the overall security responsibility because we've seen what happens when we don't have that security responsibility,\" he said. Both Israel and Hamas have rebuffed mounting international pressure for a ceasefire. Israel says Hamas should release the hostages first; Hamas says it will not free them or stop fighting while Gaza is under assault. Reuters",
