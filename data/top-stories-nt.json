The decision is another blow for the Commonwealth Games Federation (CGF) after the Canadian city of Hamilton (which hosted the inaugural Games in 1930) suspended its bid and Australia's Victorian government last month withdrew as host of the 2026 Games due to projected cost overruns. The Alberta bid was scuttled for similar reasons, Reuters reports. \"We promised to remain transparent with Albertans about the costs of hosting international sporting events and clearly demonstrating a return on our investment for the people and communities of Alberta,\" wrote Mackenzie Blyth, press secretary to the Minister of Tourism and Sports Joseph Schow in an email to CBC. \"In the case of the 2030 Commonwealth Games, the numbers just didn't add up for our government to commit taxpayer's money with the games estimated to cost $CA2.68 billion ($3.1 billion).\"",

Kershaw says while he considers Fuller a friend, the relationship is professional. \"Mr Fuller and I do not have dinner at each other's homes, we do not play golf together and I don't know the personal details of his life,\" he says. \"I want to be clear about that because it is important that our professional relationship is not miscategorised.\" You can read more on this story here:",

The August statement has given more detail about why Australia's central bank chose to leave interest rates on hold this month, surprising many economists. One thing is clear — the decision not to raise rates further was again a close call. \"At both the July and August meetings, the board considered the option of raising rates further,\" the SOMP observed. \"The board's current assessment is that the risks around the inflation outlook are broadly balanced. \"But it recognises that the crystallisation of upside risks would increase the likelihood of inflation staying high for longer and a rise in medium-term inflation expectations.\"",

Boss Shayne Elliott said ANZ is \"naturally disappointed and disagree with the ACCC's decision\". \"We believe the acquisition will improve competition, which will benefit Australian consumers, particularly in Queensland,\" Mr Elliott said in the ASX statement. ANZ also noted that decisions by the ACCC could be reviewed by the Australian Competition Tribunal. And in the meantime, it \"continues its preparations for the integration of Suncorp Bank into ANZ\". Meanwhile, Suncorp shares are now down 1.9 per cent after the news. Suncorp chair Christine McLoughlin says the bank is \"surprised and disappointed\" and would \"fully support\" ANZ if it referred the decision to the Australian Competition Tribunal. \"… we believe the Tribunal will accept the merits of our case,\" she said. Federal Treasurer Jim Chalmers has also noted the decision, saying the government \"respects the independence of the ACCC and does not intend to comment further on the decision or the future of the proposal\", but noted that there is the option for the banks to take the decision to the Tribunal or Federal Court.
