There's brewing concerns about demand growth in China as its economy slows, coupled with fears about US rates staying higher for longe r. Both the major benchmarks for West Texas Intermediate crude and B rent crude are fairly flat, with the US Federal Reserve's focus on containing inflation alongside stronger-than-expected economic data keeping the prices mostly contained. Reuters reports that investors are concerned that should the Fed leave rates higher for longer, those higher borrowing costs could stifle economic growth, and reduce overall demand — including for oil. On top of the US concerns, China's sputtering economy has added to contagion fears, which has only added to oil concerns, as it's the world's second-largest oil consumer. Back in July, China made a very rare draw on its crude oil inventories, which was the first time in 33 months it dipped into its storage, while US crude oil inventories fell by almost 6 million barrels last week.",
