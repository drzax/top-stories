We don't know what's happening from minute to minute, the fire is moving very fast.” He said their \"number one concern\" is the safety of residents. “The message is if you can get out, get out while you can because we don't want to lose lives.” An evacuation centre at Stanthorpe is ready to take any evacuees.",

The document is dated October 13 and was first published by Sicha Mekomit, a local news site.

The document proposes moving Gaza's civilian population to tent cities in northern Sinai, then building permanent cities and an undefined humanitarian corridor.

The Offshore Alliance is an alliance between The Australian Workers' Union (AWU) and the Maritime Union of Australia (MUA). It says the agreements deliver members secure jobs, fixed rosters, career progression and significant improvements in pay and conditions of employment. For Gorgon and Wheatstone Downstream, the Offshore Alliance was negotiating on behalf of its members with Chevron since the start of 2023, and since mid-2022 for its members at the Wheatstone Platform. AWU WA secretary Brad Gandy says Offshore Alliance members at Chevron never blinked during negotiations. \"Subjective behavioural standards, which have previously prevented members progressing through the classification structure, are gone. Career progression will now be competency based,\" he said in a statement. \"Forty per cent rosters are now locked in for all employees, which means those coerced by Chevron during COVID to move to a 50 per cent roster will transferred to their previous, more family friendly roster. \"Chevron employees now have union representation, arbitration of disputes in the Fair Work Commission, improved overcycle provisions and significantly enhanced training provisions, including additional payment, allowances and the right to refuse additional work.\"",
