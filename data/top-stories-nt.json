              "plaintext": "The cost of living is falling but core inflation - which strips out volatile items like petrol - remains stubbornly high. The ABS says consumer inflation rose 5.6 per cent over the year to May, down from the 6.8 per cent increase over the year to April. That's because the fuel excise was halved in April last year, so when the discount ended the rebound in petrol prices boosted inflation. The headline figure shows that prices are heading in the right direction amid 12 rises in interest rates since May last year. ABS head of price statistics Michelle Marquardt: \"This month’s annual increase of 5.6 per cent is the smallest increase since April last year. \" \"While prices have kept rising for most goods and services, many increases were smaller than we have seen in recent months.\" Housing prices rose 8.4 per cent over the year, food and non alcoholic beverages rose 7.9 per cent, and furniture, household equipment and services rose 6 per cent, while petrol prices dropped 8 per cent. But Ms Marquardt notes that core inflation remains above 6 per cent as you can see from the dark line in the graph above. \"It can be helpful to exclude items with volatile price changes from the headline CPI indicator to provide a view of underlying inflation,” Ms Marquardt said. “When excluding these volatile items, the decline in inflation is more modest. \" \"The annual increase for the monthly CPI indicator was 6.4 per cent in May, slightly lower than the rise of 6.5 per cent recorded in April and down from a peak of 7.3 per cent in December 2022.\" The Reserve Bank will be closely watching these figures when it considers interest rates next week.",

I've put your question to global affairs editor John Lyons who says: Hello David — My view is that there is no chance that Ukraine would invade Russia. Ukraine's entire support from its international partners is predicated on defending itself from an illegal invasion. It's on that basis that various countries — many of the NATO countries, Australia and others — have provided support. For Ukraine to invade another country would mean it was doing the same thing that it was defending itself from and would lead to complete chaos in the region. I think if civil war breaks out in Russia, Ukraine will sit back and watch. Some Ukrainians may be relieved as it will mean that if the Russians are fighting internally then they will not be focused on attacking Ukraine.",

I've put your question to our global affairs editor John Lyons, who says: Thanks Ann — excellent question as it cuts to the heart of the relationship now between Putin and Prigozhin. Why would Prigozhin have done it? In my assessment two reasons: he wanted to put pressure on both the Defence Minister Shoigu and Army commander Gerasimov as he believes their performance has been woeful. And secondly I think he wanted to stamp his claim to the top levels of Russian politics over coming months. Prigozhin is very ambitious, and much smarter a player than many people give him credit for. Non-one else has \"stabbed\" Putin in the back — Putin's own words — and got out of the country alive. And why not charged? In my view Putin was shaken, and wanted to defuse the situation asap. To charge Progozhin would have made something of a martyr out of him. Better to have in Belarus where Alexander Lukashenko can keep a very close eye on him.",

We now know there is at least one person bold enough and unafraid enough to publicly question Putin's authority over decisions such as who should run Russia's military and the strategy in Ukraine. This was an armed mutiny by Prigozhin, a march on Moscow, planes were shot out of the sky. It is a huge change in the dynamic inside that country. Vladimir Putin says the fact it was over within 24 hours is a sign of national unity, but power is a very delicate thing. From inside Russia, there is surprise that Yevgeny Prigozhin was even allowed to leave and wasn't met with the forces available to Putin — that he apepars to have not been punished. That will have weakened the regime. Now we should watch to see if any changes are made to the leadership of the Russian military and if any of Prigozhin's demands are met. That would be a massive victory for the man now living in exile.",
