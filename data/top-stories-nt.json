She's just talked about the impact that bank closures have on staff and the local community, saying it can be \"devastating\" for rural communities. \"Staff are often given very little notice when their bank is about to close,\" she said. She's just described in detail how bank staff can be caught in a Catch-22 situation that leads to their branches being closed. \"Frontline branch staff in most banks have targets imposed on them to migrate customers to digital banking options. \"The friendly concierge at the front door is there to guide customers to digital options to deter them from getting to a teller's station. She says branch staff have KPIs and targets imposed on them for migrating customers away from interactions with physical staff and towards digital options, and if you're good at your job then you're eventually doing yourself out of a job, because the numbers will show that staff are less and less required. \"The irony of this is that you are damned if you do and damned if you don't,\" she said.",
