It says inflation was running at an annual pace of 4.9% in July, down from 5.4% in June. And that's down from a peak of 8.4% in December. The monthly indicator is not as comprehensive as the quarterly inflation data because it doesn't capture 100% of the prices in the economy. However, economists say it provides a pretty good indication of how prices are behaving, so this will be positive news for the Reserve Bank.",
