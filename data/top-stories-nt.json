Peter, I think there is fear on both the Israeli and Palestinian sides. Everybody knows that a war can have tragic and unpredictable consequences. As for journalists, we know there’s a level of risk but we try to mitigate that risk wherever possible. As I said in an earlier post, while we’ve been doing this live blog a siren went off here in Ashdod which means we should go to a shelter. The thing you have to keep in mind in Ashdod is that you don’t have much time as it’s close to the Gaza border. Ashkelon is even closer. As soon as it went off I bolted for the stairwell, to get away from windows. In there I head two or three huge explosions – that could have been the missiles hitting or Israel’s Iron Dome system shooting down the incoming missiles. My point is that if you observe protocol – head quickly for the stairwells, etc – then you minimise your chance of something happening. That said, too many journalists are killed covering wars.",
