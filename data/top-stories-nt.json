The ABC's North America correspondent Carrington Clarke has more: Carrington: Donald Trump’s campaign was quick to note in a statement that \"President Trump has always followed the law and the Constitution, with advice from many highly accomplished attorneys\". But what might be worrying for them is that of the six so far unnamed co-conspirators listed in the indictment, four are identified as 'attorney'. The legal advice being offered and acted upon by Donald Trump will be one of the key components in the trial of Donald Trump and his co-conspirators. The co-conspirators also present an opportunity for special counsel Jack Smith and his team. If they’re able to apply the right type of pressure to flip them, they may prove to be helpful to the case against the former president.",

RBA governor Philip Lowe noted that higher interest rates were bringing down inflation, but did not rule out raising borrowing costs again with annual inflation running at 6 per cent. Barrenjoey chief economist Jo Masters has lowered her forecasts for where official rates will peak, from 4.6 per cent to 4.1 per cent. She says it is likely the RBA board thinks there have been enough interest rate rises to lower inflation to between 2 to 3 per cent by mid-2025. \"We read today’s statement as a signal that the board believes there is sufficient  tightening in the pipeline to achieve their inflation objective; that they want to be done  with the tightening cycle. \"This sets a high bar to further rate hikes, and the onus on  the data to surprise sufficiently to force the board’s hand back to the table.\" UBS chief economist George Tharenou has lowered his forecast for the terminal rate from 4.35 per cent to 4.1 per cent, although a 0.25 per cent rise in November is possible, before a cut mid next year. The Commonwealth Bank now also expects the cash rate to remain on hold at 4.1 per cent for an extended period. National Australia Bank expects the peak cash rate to reach 4.35 per cent in November. Interest rate rises are slowing the economy with weaker inflation and retail sales. The recovery in home prices is also easing. Here's more from Stephanie Chalmers on The Business.",

Fitch says the downgrade reflects the expected fiscal deterioration over the next three years, a high and growing general government debt burden, and the erosion of governance. In May, Fitch threatened to cut the AAA credit rating because of the US debt ceiling standoff. \"In Fitch's view, there has been steady deterioration in standards of governance over the last 20 years, including on fiscal and debt matters, notwithstanding the June bipartisan agreement to suspend the debt limit until January 2025.\" \"The repeated debt limit political standoffs and last minute resolutions have eroded confidence in fiscal management.\" Fitch is also predicting a mild recession for the US economy later this year and early next year because of high interest rates, weakening business investment and a slowdown in spending. It expects the Federal Reserve to lift interest rates one more time to 5.5 per cent to 5.75 per cent by next month. Standard and Poor's downgraded the US credit rating from the top AAA rating in 2011 after the US managed to avoid a debt default. Moody's Investors Service has maintained the US credit rating at AAA. Credit ratings are used by investors to assess a country or company's ability to repay their debts. The reality is a AA+ credit rating is still very high and won't have much impact on the borrowing costs of the US. But not every one agrees with Fitch's decision including former Treasury secretary Larry Summers.",
