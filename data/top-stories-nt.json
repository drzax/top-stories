The report shows the reliance on the age pension will reduce, because of growing superannuation balances. Mr Chalmers says it shows that super is achieving its purpose of providing retirement support. \"Spending on the pension, age pension and service pension will go down from about 2.3 percent of the economy last year to 2 percent at end of IGR period. that is an absolutely stunning outcome when you consider the aging of our population.\" It's important to note though that tax breaks associated with superannuation will exceed pension spending by the 2040s and reach 2.4 per cent of GDP by 2063.

Assistant Minister for Competition Andrew Leigh says Australia's productivity growth has slowed over the past decade and reduced competition has contributed. The review will look at competition laws, policies and institutions and a competition task force has been established in Treasury. The review will look at: Proposals put forward by the Australian      Competition and Consumer Commission around merger reform, as well as other      competition law issues Options for coordinated reform with states      and territories, to be progressed through the Council on Federal Financial      Relations Non-compete and related clauses that      restrict workers from shifting to a better-paying job Providing advice on competition issues      raised by new technologies, the net zero transformation and growth in the      care economy Former ACCC chair Rod Sims and current ACCC chair Gina Cass-Gottleib have called for stronger laws to stop mergers that entrench market power. \"We always need to get the balance right on merger reform,\" said Mr Leigh. \"The ACCC's proposals ... are serious proposals deserving of careful scrutiny\"",
