White phosphorus is a chemical element that ignites when it comes into contact with air, making it useful for producing aerial markers or smokescreens, but also dangerous to civilian populations as it can cause serious burns. Its use as a weapon against civilians is illegal under the 1983 Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons. \"We deny those allegations. We have not made use of white phosphorus — not in Gaza and not in Lebanon,\" an IDF spokesman said in a statement. The accusation was levelled by the international NGO Human Rights Watch, which published an investigation into the reported use of white phosphorus munitions in Lebanon and Gaza on October 10 and 11, respectively. It cited analysis of video footage as well as interviews with two people who witnessed the strikes. Israel has previously pledged to limit its use of white phosphorus after coming under heavy criticism for firing shells containing the chemical over Gaza in 2008.",
