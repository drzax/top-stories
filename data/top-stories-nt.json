Nineteen Australian citizens are known to be in Gaza. The Department Foreign Affairs and Trade has sent a message to Australians in the area to move to the crossing in southern Gaza if they “assess it to be safe”, citing media reports that the crossing will be open to Australian citizens. “The situation is fluid and unpredictable but if you assess it to be safe, we strongly encourage you to move quickly to the Rafah crossing area now,” the DFAT message states. “We do not know when there will be another opportunity for you to depart Gaza or how long the crossing may be open.” Australians have been told they will be given more information once they have reached Egypt. “Do not delay your departure because you are uncertain of arrangement after you cross into Egypt,” the message said. “The Australian Government will provide details to you about the support that will be available to you in Egypt.” DFAT has told Australians that the Australian Government is seeking permission for other passport holders who are family members of Australian citizens to depart Gaza but “cannot guarantee authorities will permit other passport holders to exit”.",
