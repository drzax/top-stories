As my colleague Daniel Ziffer explains, the Australian Federal Police (AFP) are investigating a former PwC partner over potential crimes. PwC also holds lucrative contracts with the AFP, as its auditor. Senate documents reveal PwC is by far the AFP's preferred firm, with more than $20 million in contracts since 2021. Senator Barbara Pocock is concerned that the contract muddy the investigation: \"We really can't have confidence when that level of contracting is so high to PwC. \"The contamination of the process, and the perception of contamination can happen on both levels in terms of contracts and personnel.\" The AFP has said it is confident it can manage a criminal investigation into PwC despite the contracts.
