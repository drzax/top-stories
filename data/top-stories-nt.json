There was also some good news in there showing inflation is easing, according to early analysis by Westpac. (How do these economists get out analysis so early?) In response, Wall Street... dropped significantly. As it stands, it looks like the S & P 500 is headed for quite a correction. Showing you that good news is sometimes bad news. It appears investors think this latest set of strong economic data means the Fed will keep hiking rates. On the flip side, 10 year Treasury yields have dropped marginally. So who really knows? Potentially, the CEO of deVere? He says the economic future in the US is not that rosy despite the latest GDP data. Here is one of Nigel Green's reasons: “The bond market is sending red-flag signals that it believes a recession is looming. For more than a year now, we’ve seen an inverted yield curve, which is when the yield on the two-year Treasury has overtaken that of the 10-year note. “From the 1960s to today, every time the long-term rate was lower than a short-term rate, a recession followed. It’s happened for the last eight recessions – and it's never been wrong.” Over in Europe, the ECB has kept rates on hold for the first time in 10 months. That was widely expected and the markets didn't really react that much. The central bank's statement also all but confirmed that's the end of their tightening cycle, with economic conditions there remaining weak. And here in Australia, we are headed for a subdued open. We've had a lot of appearances by the RBA this week. Here is Nassim Khadem's wrap of their new governor in front of Senate Estimates yesterday. Grab a cup of coffee. It's Friday!",
