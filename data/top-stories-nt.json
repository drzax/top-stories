The All Ordinaries and ASX 200 are also up about +0.3 % (at 12.00pm AEST). BDO Economics Partner Anders Magnusson says a low unemployment rate usually indicates that things are good for households. \"However, this is currently accompanied by high multiple job holdings and increasing hours worked per employee, which suggests otherwise. With costs rising more quickly than wages, Australians are working more jobs and longer hours to make ends meet.\" It all means there is unlikely to be further interest rate hikes from the Reserve Bank next month. Mr Magnusson says he expects inflation to continue decreasing. \"Simultaneously low unemployment should be viewed by the RBA as a good thing rather than an inflation risk. Especially as wages have continued to grow by less than inflation over the last year.\"",
