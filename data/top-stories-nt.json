The late Gumatj clan leader and former Australian of the Year passed away earlier this year at age 74. Mr Dutton was speaking at a press conference in Adelaide, where he made a link between Yunupiŋu's achievements in helping improve economic outcomes for his Yolŋu people, and how that was a reason Australia should vote against the \"Canberra-based bureaucracy\" of an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Voice to Parliament. Indigenous Australians Minister Linda Burney called for Mr Dutton to apologise, accusing him of using the late leader's \"name in vain\" and of making inaccurate references to East Arnhem Land. Yunupiŋu's brother and now-leader of the Gumatj clan Djawa Yunupiŋu released a short statement in relation to Mr Dutton's comments, via the Yothu Yindi Foundation. \"It saddens our family to see my brother's name and legacy twisted like this,\" Mr Yunupiŋu said. \"He was a strong advocate for the Voice, and Mr Dutton knows that. \"He heard the same message loud and clear when he met with the 13-clan leadership of the Dilak Council, who also support a Voice.\" Djawa Yunupiŋu and the Dilak Council offered their unequivocal support towards a Voice to Parliament at the Garma Festival in north-east Arnhem Land earlier this year. Mr Dutton has been approached for further comment. NOTE: Yunupiŋu's surname and image are used in accordance with the wishes of his family.",

This is a big one, and could open up a whole bunch of other possibilities. Let's go through it club by club: Melbourne get pick 11 for picks 14, 27 and 35 Adelaide get pick 14 and Chris Burgess for picks 23 and 26 North Melbourne get pick 18 for a future end-of-first-round pick Gold Coast get picks 23, 26, 27, 35, and a future end-of-first-round pick for picks 11, 18 and Chris Burgess Now we're talking.
