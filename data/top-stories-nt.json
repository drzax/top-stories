Gaza's health ministry spokesman said 170 patients and hundreds of displaced Palestinians were in the hospital building at the time. He said several Palestinians were wounded in the strike. But an Israeli military spokesperson, when asked about the claim, said: \"There was no IDF (Israel Defense Forces) strike on the Shifa hospital.\" Earlier, Al Jazeera TV and Hamas-affiliated Al Aqsa radio said Israeli forces had targeted a solar panel system at the hospital complex. Chief IDF spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari, asked about those reports during a briefing with reporters, said: \"We didn't attack, to the best of my knowledge, solar panels in the Shifa hospital.\" Israel's military has previously presented alleged evidence showing the hospitals are used by Hamas as bases of operation.

Senator Janet Rice raised a printed page showing the Palestinian flag as they walked out. Mr Shorten this morning said no one thinks this move helps. \"I don't think the Greens walking out helps a single soul anywhere. I think that is just political grand standing. I don't know how that helps,\" he said \"I think that the Government has the right line of length. We want to make sure that we are supporting the humanitarian pause. \"We want to see relief get through to innocent Palestinian civilians. \"But you know, with the Greens … they don't walk out over Hamas. So I think that these guys are opportunists.\" He said the Australian government's messaging on the issue is right. \"This most recent shocking conflict was triggered by Hamas crossing the borders into Israel,\" he said. \"I think the government has made its position clear that Israel has a right to defend itself. \"We also want to make sure that, to the extent that it is possible, the rules of war are followed. \"That means these civilians, these Palestinian civilians, it's not their fault. It's shameful. What we're seeing is very difficult too.\" You can read more about what transpired yesterday here:",
