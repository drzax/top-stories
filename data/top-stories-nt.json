The broader Topix rose 1.3 per cent to 2,436 and is on course to post a 3.3 per cent weekly gain. \"First of all, the market rose because Wall Street was strong,\" said Shoichi Arisawa, general manager of the investment research department at IwaiCosmo Securities. \"And the strong debut of Arm has raised investor sentiment and prompted them to buy chip-related shares.\" US stocks ended sharply higher overnight as robust economic data failed to budge expectations that the Federal Reserve will leave its key interest rate unchanged next week. Adding to positive sentiment, SoftBank Group's Arm was valued at nearly $US60 billion in a strong Nasdaq debut overnight, with the chip designer's shares soaring nearly 25 per cent in their first day of trading. Shares in SoftBank Group rose as much as 5 per cent earlier in the session but trimmed most of their gains to end the morning session up 1.7 per cent.",

The ASX 200 index climbed 1.8 per cent to 7,315 points by 12:26pm AEST and looked set to post its sharpest daily rise since mid July, if gains held. The benchmark has risen 1.6 per cent so far in the week, heading for its best week in nearly two months. Investors worldwide were awaiting a slew of data from China, which has been struggling to prop up its economy after a brief post-COVID recovery. Back home, data released on Thursday showed that Australian jobs surged in August. However, it did not dent hopes for the country's central bank to stand pat on interest rates next month. Heavyweight miners led the gains, rising 3.3 per cent in their biggest intraday percentage climb since July 25 on strong metal prices. Mining giants BHP and Rio Tinto climbed 3.8 per cent each, while Fortescue was up 4.4 per cent. Financials rose 1.4 per cent, with the \"big four\" banks up between 1 per cent and 1.6 per cent. Energy stocks advanced 2.1 per cent as oil prices rose to their highest level in 2023. Sector major Woodside Energy was up 1.9 per cent.",
