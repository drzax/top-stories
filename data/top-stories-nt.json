              "plaintext": "An overall gloomy update to their economic forecasts from CBA's economics team. Odds of a recession in 2023 at 50%; Forecasts based on one more RBA cash rate rise to 4.35%, but risk of two more to 4.6%; Unemployment rate to end 2023 at 4.4% and to be 4.7% by mid-2024. But it's not all bad: The annual rate of inflation to decline to 3.8% by late 2023 (CBA forecast is for underlying inflation to be 3.6%/yr in Q4 23); CBA expects 1.25 percentage points of rate cuts in 2024. CBA's head of Australian economics Gareth Aird expects consumers to drive the downturn, with household consumption falling per capita, and possibly outright, this year. While the Reserve Bank has focused on the stock of savings Australians accumulated during the pandemic, Mr Aird says they are concentrated amongst people who don't need to spend them, and probably won't as the economy tanks. \"A large stock of savings were accrued during the pandemic. But the savings were not distributed evenly. The bulk of the savings amassed during the pandemic sit within the older cohort of society. \"We do not expect this demographic to draw down on their savings swiftly. Rather they are likely to spend these savings in a protracted way over many years. The upshot is that we do not anticipate a speedy injection of the accrued savings back into the economy. \"Households as a collective tend to draw down on savings when they are feeling positive about the economic outlook. That is not the case right now.\" And for households with mortgages — especially those with large, recent mortgages, like the 35-44-year-olds who bought a home during the pandemic and saw their savings decline — things will be tougher than they have ever been before. But, while CBA expects 2023 to be something of an annus horribilis for the Australian economy, Mr Aird is more upbeat about our prospects when we get through to the other side in 2024. \"Readers may feel like there is a pessimistic tone to this note. That is understandable. Economists don't take pleasure in downgrading the outlook for economic growth and upwardly revising their forecasts for unemployment. But there is light at the end of the tunnel. \"Once the proverbial 'inflation dragon' is slayed monetary policy will be able to move away from a deeply restrictive setting to a more neutral one. Rate relief will arrive to the household sector in the future and we expect that to happen in early 2024. \"As interest rates are cut it will free up cash for those borrowers that have a mortgage. And the demand for credit will begin to lift. As this happens economic momentum will start to pick up and the upward trend in the unemployment rate will wane. Consumer sentiment and spending will lift. \"Our expectation is that the unemployment rate will peak at 4.7% in mid 2024 before grinding back down to 4.5% in late 2024 .\" So, batten down the hatches, try and make it through this year, and hopefully that light at the end of the tunnel for 2024 isn't an oncoming train. Gareth Aird has spoken to Rachel Pupazzoni about his latest forecasts. Keep an eye out for the interview on Close of Business and the ABC News YouTube channel.",

Because APRA removed a 7% floor on its mortgage serviceability test, many borrowers were offered loans during the pandemic period based on whether they could afford repayments if their mortgage rate rose to 5%, in some cases perhaps even less than that. A typical variable mortgage rate is now closer to 6% after the RBA's latest rate hike, so that leaves these borrowers paying more than the maximum they were tested to be able to afford. I wrote about the problems this was likely to create late last year, before the RBA added a further percentage point to the cash rate so far in 2023. One way to try and close that gap is by refinancing to one of the cheaper rates in the market. But to do that, you have to meet the serviceability test again. But this time, instead of being tested on whether you can afford rates around 5%, you'll be tested on whether you can still pay your mortgage at 9% interest rates. Research from RateCity has found a family of four, where one parent works full-time and the other part-time at half the wage, on a combined annual income of $143,221 before tax, will have seen their maximum borrowing capacity drop by $247,700 as a result of the 12 RBA hikes and the current serviceability test. That leaves many people in mortgage prison, stuck on an uncompetitive rate but unable to switch lenders to a better deal. Today APRA has written to the banks, credit unions and building societies that it regulates warning them not to be too generous with serviceability test exemptions that could help some borrowers get out of mortgage prison. \"APRA requires banks to have prudent policies and processes for dealing with exceptions to policy. \"Large volumes of exceptions can create risks by weakening banks' risk profiles and increasing the vulnerability of their loan books to future shocks. \"Historically, serviceability policy exceptions have accounted for a small share of banks' total housing lending, at between 2 and 3 per cent. \"It is important that exceptions are used in a prudent and limited manner, so as not to undermine the intent of the core policy. \"In using exceptions, APRA expects banks to make a prudent assessment of repayment capacity so that there is a good outcome for borrowers and the financial system.\" Given that estimates from some of the major banks and leading bank analysts put between 15-25% of borrowers in this situation, it seems most will remain stuck in mortgage prison for quite a while yet.",
