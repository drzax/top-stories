The nine-metre boat was on its way from Vanuatu to Cairns when both hulls were damaged in several shark attacks. The group activated an emergency beacon at 1:30am, and the Australian Maritime Safety Authority requested the assistance of a nearby vehicle carrier along with the Cairns-based Challenger Rescue Aircraft. The vehicle carrier, Dugong Ace, collected the group. They are due to arrive in Brisbane on Thursday.",

Economists are predicting the economy will have flatlined from April to June with economic growth predicted to expand by just 0.3 per cent over the quarter, and by 1.8 per cent from a year ago. The Reserve Bank expects the Australian economy to grow by just over 1 per cent this year. Mr Chalmers has told RN Breakfast that the global economy is in an uncertain place and China is slowing down. \"We've seen, particularly in their property sector but also in relation to their retail and in relation to their exports, that the Chinese economy has been slowing quite considerably. \"And that's obviously important to us.\" Mr Chalmers says the combination of China's slowdown and higher interest rates is putting pressure on the Australian economy. \"The challenges to our economy are substantial.\" But Mr Chalmers maintained the government's view that Australia was expected to avoid a recession.
