The 46-year-old was unveiled today as the new Tigers coach, after just beating interim coach Andrew McQualter. Yze has tasted premiership success as an assistant coach with both Hawthorn and Melbourne. He says he wasn't deterred from applying for the Richmond position, despite missing out on several senior coaching jobs including Essendon and the Giants last year. “We‘re not going to put a ceiling on where we can finish,” Yze says. “I get huge upside watching what other teams have done ... not to say that that’s what we’re going to do but that’s what we’re going to strive to do. “I want our players walking into the footy club thinking that they can make the top four next year. We won’t put a ceiling on it. “There might be some bumps along the road and as a footy club we’ll be really strong during that period. Can’t wait to get started.”",

Figures from the AEC reveal almost 98 per cent of eligible Australians have registered to vote in the Indigenous Voice to Parliament referendum next month. A Voice to Parliament would act as an independent advisory body for First Nations people. Australian Electoral Commissioner, Tom Rogers, says the registration figures are a great result. \"It's criticial that all Australians have their chance to have their say,\" he says. \"Youth enrolment is at the highest rate its ever been for an electoral event and the same for estimated indigenous enrolment so it's a great outcome for all Australians and it means that it will be a solid event and a solid outcome.\" Rogers says the referendum vote is a huge logistical event. \"We'll be visiting well over 750 remote communities. I think last week we dispatched 160,000 ballot papers to our overseas missions - the largest in-person overseas vote that we've seen. \"Big postal process is underway. I think as of yesterday we've had something like about 1.2 million applications for postal votes.\"",
