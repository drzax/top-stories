Lieutenant Colonel Jonathon Conricus spoke to Raf Epstein on ABC Radio Melbourne a short time ago. He was asked whether it was certain that Israel would mount a ground invasion of Gaza. \"The aim here is to totally dismantle Hamas from its military capabilities. If that can be done from the air and with stand-off measures, with very limited exposure to our troops and less damage on the ground, that would be great,\" he said. \"If Hamas was to come out of their hiding places … return our hostages, all 212 of them, and surrender unconditionally, then the war would end. \"If they won't, we would probably have to go in and get it done.\" Lt. Col. Conricus also suggested protests being carried out against Israel, in Australia and abroad, were being attended by people who were \"either uninformed or really filled with hate towards Israel based on things that have nothing to do with what's going on in Gaza now.\" \"If you stand with an organisation that sent a thousand or more armed men into a sovereign country in order to execute, burn alive, rape, butcher, mutilate and behead civilians … that's where you stand,\" he said. \"Those are your morals and that is how you will go down in history.\" The vast majority of those taking part in Pro-Palestinian protests around the world are holding up signs in support of Palestinian people and against air strikes in Gaza, rather than in support of Hamas. The Gaza health ministry says at least 4,651 people have been killed in Gaza, with more than a thousand being children.",
