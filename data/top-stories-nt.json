He noted that inflation had been wildly different during his time as RBA governor — and more than it had been in two decades. When he began as RBA governor, inflation was below that sweet spot of the 2-3% range we hear about so often, and as we know, inflation rose to its highest level in more than 30 years recently. Overall, he said underlying inflation was averaging 2.7% in his seven-year term, while headline inflation was around 3%. But he does expect that inflation will swing more wildly than it has ever before because of the increased prevalence of supply shocks (like what we saw during the pandemic) plus c limate change, energy transitions and changing demographics. \"My view is that it will be difficult to return to the earlier world in which inflation tracked in a very narrow range,\" he said. That doesn't mean the end of inflation targeting, however — he remains a strong advocate for that 2-3% range.",
