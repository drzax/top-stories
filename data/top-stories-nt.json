              "plaintext": "Australian shares have risen in afternoon trade, helped by gains in energy and financial stocks, while traders awaited the US central bank's policy meeting this week for further interest rate clues. The ASX 200 index advanced 0.3 per cent or 20 points, to 6,793 by 1:37pm AEDT after hitting a more than one-year low on Monday. The US Federal Reserve is expected to leave policy rates on hold at the end of its two-day meeting starting later in the day. Market participants will focus on the message from Fed policymakers to gauge the interest rate outlook. Meanwhile, retail sales in Australia rose at the fastest pace in eight months in September, suggesting resilience in consumer spending which would add to the case for an interest rate hike at the Australian central bank's policy meeting on November 7. Investors are also looking out for a survey of purchasing managers in China's manufacturing segment later in the day to assess the economic recovery of Australia's top trading partner. A Reuters poll showed China's manufacturing activity likely expanded for a second straight month in October. In Sydney, interest rate-sensitive financials rose 0.7 per cent, with the big four banks gaining between 0.5 per cent and 0.7 per cent. Energy stocks jumped 0.3 per cent, with Woodside Energy and Santos up 0.8 per cent and 0.9 per cent, respectively. Technology stocks .AXIJ tracked their Wall Street peers higher, gaining 0.1 per cent. Shares of Xero jumped 0.3 per cent. Gold stocks slid 1.3 per cent, with miner Northern Star Resources losing 2.7 per cent. Among individual stocks, Origin Energy fell 0.6 per cent after superannuation fund AustralianSuper said it plans to vote against a Brookfield-led consortium's $US9.78 billion takeover offer for the company.

In a speech on emerging threats to financial stability on Tuesday, RBA assistant governor Brad Jones said supply shocks, a higher and more volatile bond term premium, and reduced smoothing from price-insensitive buyers were the potential contributing factors to a structurally higher interest rate volatility, despite that much of the past two decades saw long-term interest rate volatility either decline or languish at unusually subdued levels. He said a period of structurally higher interest rate volatility would present several challenges to financial system stability. \"Banks of all sizes will have to manage overall duration risk more intently,\" Mr Jones said. \"Over much of the past few decades, growth in incomes consistently exceeded the level of interest rates. This dampened credit risks for lenders. But debt servicing among borrowers with high debt levels will be more challenging – and credit risks will increase as a result – in an environment where interest rates periodically exceed the growth in incomes. \"The post-GFC era of exceptionally low interest rate volatility gave rise to a new generation of investment business models and strategies. \"It remains to be seen how market functioning could be affected in a regime of higher inflation and interest rate volatility, including where open-end fixed-income funds encounter liquidity stress, margining is more tightly enforced than in the past, and broker-dealers are unable or unwilling to supply liquidity.\"",
