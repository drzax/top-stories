In a statement to the ABC, a Chevron spokesperson says the comapny's received notices of protected action at its Gorgon and Wheatstone facilities, off the coast of Western Australia. \"While we don't believe that industrial action is necessary for agreement to be reached, we recognise employees have the right to take protected industrial action and we will continue to take steps to maintain safe and reliable operations in the event of disruption at our facilities,\" a Chevron Australia spokesperson said. \"We will also continue to work through the bargaining process as we seek outcomes that are in the interests of both employees and the company.\" In a Facebook post, the Offshore Alliance said its members \"won't be intimidated\" and slammed the bargaining process. According to Reuters, European natural gas prices surged overnight following the news of the stoppages late yesterday, as Gorgon and Wheatstone account for more than 5 per cent of global LNG production capacity. Last week, strikes were averted at Woodside's offshore LNG projects after a pay deal was struck.",
