It's warned it would resume a case at the World Trade Organisation if there is a further delay. Australia agreed to temporarily suspend the case in April after Beijing agreed to finish the review in three months, with a possible fourth if required. \"China has now requested this one-month extension, which we have agreed to,\" a spokesman for Foreign Minister Penny Wong and Trade Minister Don Farrell said. \"While we are disappointed China's review could not be completed within the initial three months, we remain hopeful the impediments will be lifted in the near future.\" Diplomatic tensions between China and Australia have eased since the Labor Government came to power last year. In 2020, China imposed tariffs of 80.5 per cent on Australian barley imports for up to five years as part of a trade row. Reuters",
