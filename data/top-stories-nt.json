The hospital, which doctors say has been under intense fire, suspended operations on Saturday after running out of fuel to power it. The World Health Organization says it \"is not functioning as a hospital anymore\". But hundreds of patients and doctors are still there. \"It's my hope and expectation that there will be less intrusive action relative to the hospital,\" Biden told reporters here in Washington. \"The hospital must be protected,\" he added. The Gazan health ministry says 32 patients, including three babies, have died since the hospital lost power. It says 36 babies are among patients at risk of dying because life-saving equipment, including incubators, can't function. The premature babies have been wrapped in foil and placed next to hot water to keep them alive, the director of the medical center, Dr Muhammad Abu Salmiya, has told CNN. \"There is no more water, food, milk for children and babies… the situation in the hospital is catastrophic.\" Israel has repeatedly claimed there is a Hamas command center under the hospital. Hamas and hospital officials say this is untrue. Reporting with AP",

              "plaintext": "Palestinian militant group Hamas says it told Qatari mediators the group was ready to release up to 70 women and children held in Gaza in return for a five-day truce with Israel. \"Last week there was an effort from the Qatari brothers to release the enemy captives from women and children, in return for the release of 200 Palestinian children and 75 women detained by the enemy\" Abu Ubaida, the spokesman for the armed wing of Hamas, al-Qassam Brigades, said in an audio recording posted on the group's Telegram channel. \"The truce should include a complete ceasefire and allow aid and humanitarian relief everywhere in the Gaza Strip,\" he said. He accused Israel of \"procrastinating and evading\" the price of the deal. Israel has previously rejected international calls for a ceasefire, which it says would only prolong the suffering by letting Hamas regroup. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has consistently said that there will be no ceasefire without the return of all of the more than 240 hostages captured by Hamas during its October 7 terrorist attack on southern Israel. US President Joe Biden's national security adviser Jake Sullivan said the White House would like to see longer humanitarian pauses for days in the context of a hostage release.

The country's biggest lender said its quarterly cash net profit after tax was $2.5 billion (same as the year before). A string of rate hikes since last year have boosted interest incomes and margins at Australian banks as they charged more on customer loans. But rising cost of repayments has intensified competition in the mortgage market, capping profit margins and hindering credit growth. CBA's home loan balances declined $4.5 billion in the quarter. \"This reflects a disciplined approach to pricing which ensures marginal shareholder returns remain above the cost of capital in a highly competitive market,\" the lender said in a statement. Net interest margin was lower in the quarter, mainly due to continued competitive pressure in deposits and customers switching to higher yielding deposits, CBA added. Its common equity tier 1 ratio, a measure of spare cash, stood at 11.8% as of September-end.",

The Australian share market is likely to start its day with solid gains, with ASX futures up 0.9%. That’s despite Wall Street’s main stock indexes making very little progress in either direction (ie. flat) as investors await the latest US inflation figures (on Wednesday AEDT). This data will determine whether the US Federal Reserve will keep interest rates elevated, and its timing for a rate cut – which the market is betting will happen next year. Traders have priced in a nearly 86% chance that the Fed will hold interest rates in December, according to the CME Group's FedWatch tool. Meanwhile, the Australian dollar was slightly higher at 63.8 US cents (after rising 0.2% overnight). Later this morning, NAB and Westpac will release their business conditions and consumer sentiment reports, which provides a useful snapshot of how the economy is tracking. However, the key Australian data to look out for is the ABS’s Wage Price Index and Labour Force report (out on Wednesday and Thursday). Oil prices jumped overnight after the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) published a monthly report which eased worries about waning demand in the United States and China. Brent crude futures rose 1.2% to $US82.43 a barrel. In its report, OPEC said oil market fundamentals remained strong and blamed speculators for a recent drop in prices. OPEC made a slight increase to its 2023 forecast for global oil demand growth and stuck to its relatively high 2024 prediction.",
