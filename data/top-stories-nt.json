About 1 million Palestinians in Gaza may have been displaced from their homes since the beginning of the war, due to air strikes and the order to evacuate the northern part of the enclave, the United Nations said in an update posted earlier. More than 2 million registered Palestinian refugees already live in Jordan, according to United Nations data. ABC with Reuters and AP",
