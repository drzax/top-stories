The next one of those will come on July 4 and, yes, the markets predict there is a better than 50 per cent chance of rates rising. But there is the release of the minutes from the RBA's most recent meeting, where it surprised by raising rates to 4.1% even though the market had priced in less than a 40% chance of rates rising. Those come out at 11:30am AEST. Following that, assistant governor Christopher Kent is part of a panel discussion at a derivatives conference, so probably unlikely to mention too much about rates and the economy. Later in the day, at 1:30pm AEST, deputy governor Michelle Bullock will give a speech on the topic of Achieving Full Employment to the AiGroup (a business group) in Newcastle. That sounds like a topic that will attract a lot more interest, especially given last week's much stronger than expected jobs numbers.",
