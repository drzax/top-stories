Australia is one of a slew of countries being hit with the price hike by the music streaming service, which includes lifting the price of an individual premium membership from $11.99 to $12.99. Existing subscribers will get a one-month grace period before the charge increased comes out of their account. In an announcement, Spotify trumpeted its latest innovations, including its new 'AI DJ', in explaining the decision. During trade on Wall Street overnight, Spotify shares fell 4.7 per cent on the news, which comes ahead of its quarterly earnings report to be released Tuesday US time. But hey, it wasn't all bad news according to analysts from JP Morgan, who expect a 10 per cent increase in annualised revenue for the streaming giant. So out of your account and into Spotify's!",

The survey of more than 1000 people found that nine in 10 had come across at least one suspected scam in the past year. It comes as the ACCC warns of a new scam targeting customers of loyalty points programs. The text message scam is circulating to customers of the Qantas Frequent Flyer, Telstra and Coles' loyalty programs, according to the National Anti-Scam Centre, which has received more than 200 reports of the issue in the last few months. The ACCC warns people not to click on any links in text messages and to instead access websites or apps independently, including in the loyalty scam, which tells recipients their points are expiring. \"Many of us are worried about our friends and family members becoming victims of scams,\" Choice CEO Alan Kirkland says. \"The overwhelming majority of people in Australia want the government to force businesses to do more to protect people from scams. \"We welcome the government's commitment to consult on these issues over the coming months.\"",
