              "plaintext": "Superannuation fund AustralianSuper said on Tuesday it plans to vote against a Brookfield-led consortium's $US9.78 billion takeover offer for Origin Energy, casting doubt on the future of the bid. AustralianSuper owns a 13.68 per cent stake in Origin Energy and said the offer was \"substantially below\" its estimate of long-term value for Australia's biggest energy retailer. Origin shares were down 0.9 per cent in early trade on Tuesday at $9.10 each, which was above the $8.81 offer price. The deal requires 75 per cent support from the votes cast at a shareholder meeting, meaning AustralianSuper's holding could be enough to scupper the bid if not all shareholders vote. Brookfield-consortium's offer price of $8.81 per share has been deemed fair by an independent expert's report, however, it outlined a \"roll forward\" calculation that says Origin's shares could be worth an additional 40 Australian cents by the time a potential takeover is due to occur. The Brookfield-led consortium has given no indications publicly it is considering upping the value of its bid. \"No doubt the negotiations between the bidders and key shareholders like AustralianSuper are ongoing,\" said Max Vickerson, analyst at stockbroker Morgans. \"Given that AusSuper felt the need to go public it suggests that maybe they're not that close to a deal. It's hard to say definitively that the takeover won't happen as someone could still blink before the vote but it’s not a good sign.\" Origin shares have been trading above the offer price since the deal got an approval from the country's competition regulator on October 10. Origin shares closed at $9.17 on Monday, 4.1 per cent above the offer price. AustralianSuper, which engaged consultancy firm Frontier Economics to review the independent expert's report, said the firm was also of the opinion that the assumptions used to come at a business valuation were \"unrealistically low\". \"The current offer from the Brookfield and EIG-backed consortium remains substantially below our estimate of Origin's long-term value,\" the firm said. Brookfield and EIG's MidOcean Energy did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. Reuters",
