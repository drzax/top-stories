              "plaintext": "Morning Michael. Now inflation is starting to ease, is there any indication when energy prices will follow suit? - David. Great question David. It certainly feels like the laws of physics rarely apply to free market economics — when it comes to prices, what goes up frequently stays up. According to the experts we've spoken to, there's a couple of factors as to why Australian electricity prices are still rising sharply in the coming financial year, even though the cost of the fossil fuels used to produce the majority of that energy have plunged in recent months. Director of the Monash Energy Institute, Ariel Liebman, said electricity bills are comprised of several charges. The biggest components are wholesale prices, network and retail costs. \"Their [energy retailers'] net profits aren't particularly great. It's expensive to compete in a big market, attracting customers, marketing, and all the information systems,\" he explained. So the whole cost of electricity — still mainly burning stuff to turn steam turbines — is only one part of our power bills. And, while plunging coal and gas prices have lowered wholesale energy costs on the spot market, energy retailers tend to lock in longer-term contracts, to 'hedge' the risk of being stung by short-term price spikes. \"The strategy, known as hedge contracts, fixes the wholesale price retailers pay for electricity over a long period — up to several years,\" Mr Liebman said. \" The price set in hedge contracts struck over the past year or so was influenced by Australia's domestic gas crisis in 2022, which caused massive rises in wholesale electricity prices.\" So that was before the $12 price cap on gas and caps on coal pricing. Then add in to that that the gas price cap doesn't appear to be working, according to Bruce Robertson, an energy finance analyst for gas and LNG at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA). \"Gas sets the price of electricity in the national electricity market. And the price we pay for gas is insanely high,\" Mr Robertson. \" They're laughing at the government over the gas price cap, because the gas price cap is $12. And [Tuesday] in Sydney, the gas price is $19. And in Victoria, it's $21. \"So there really isn't a cap at all. The gas industry is charging prices that aren't just high … they're obscenely high prices.\" \"We're talking about five to seven times the price of gas in the US today, we're talking prices higher than the importing countries of Europe, about 50-60 per cent higher. \" We actually produce gas in Australia. And this is a key point — it should be far cheaper here than it is in other countries. It should be more like the levels of the US, for example.\"",

The Fed seems very divided by those 'hawks' who believe rates need to keep going up until inflation falls back much closer to target and 'doves' who believe that the current level of rates will do that job, given some time. This from ANZ research's morning note, compiled by John Bromhead : \"Fed officials were divided at the May meeting over whether further hikes would be needed. \"Some were concerned that inflation was not falling fast enough, warranting further hikes, while others noted the full effects of past tightening are yet to be felt and tighter credit conditions from recent banking sector stresses could be equivalent to one or two hikes. \"Officials stressed that future decisions will be dependent on the incoming data, supporting what has been said by Fed speakers in recent weeks. Markets are currently pricing in a 29% chance of a hike in June.\" Meanwhile, a report from the AFR's political correspondent Phillip Coorey (paywalled) suggests another Philip, Lowe, is not done with raising interest rates in Australia. Apparently, the RBA governor gave a very pessimistic private briefing to members of the House of Representatives economics committee, saying the odds of staying on the \"narrow path\" between avoiding recession and getting inflation down were not great. He also reportedly said that he doesn't have any tolerance for inflation remaining high for a long time and will do what he believes needs to be done to get it back down.",

It's been a sense of, 'we've seen this movie before', with the US approaching default a few times over the past dozen years and a deal being struck at the last minute to avert catastrophe. But, while positive noises continue to emerge from Washington DC, traders are now getting a bit jittery that a deal still seems some way off from emerging. Overnight, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen confirmed that the latest estimates have the US running out of emergency measures to keep paying the bills by June 1, known as the X-date. The main markets on Wall Street fell between 0.6-0.8% overnight. European markets actually had much bigger falls, with the FTSE and Eurostoxx down 1.8%. The ASX will not be immune, with the futures down 0.4% at 7,196 points .",
