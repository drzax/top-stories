A commonly accepted technical definition of recession is two consecutive quarters of declining gross domestic product (GDP), which is the key measure of a country's economic activity. Stats NZ reported a 0.1% fall in GDP over the first three months of this year, backing up a downwardly revised 0.7% slump in economic activity during the final three months of last year. New Zealand's economy still grew 2.9% over the past year, due to strong growth in the June and September quarters, but a rapid string of interest rate rises has taken all the momentum away over more recent months. The Reserve Bank of New Zealand's (RBNZ) cash rate currently sits at 5.5% and it was amongst the first central banks to start raising rates to combat inflation. The RBNZ started raising rates from a record low of 0.25% in October 2021, more than half a year before the Reserve Bank of Australia started raising rates here in May 2022.",

We've already had 0.2 of that. \"So we're basically saying no growth in the rest of the year, unemployment goes up a little bit, but it's exactly what the Reserve Bank is trying to do. \"It's trying to essentially take money out of households, and get them to spend less, and therefore hopefully get inflation down a bit quicker.\" So is Australia heading for a recession? He says it depends how you define it. \"It depends on what your definition is. Two quarters of negative growth? I don't buy that. But I do buy the idea that if our employment goes up by 1% over a year, that's a bit of an issue, and our forecasts have that. \"So I think it's 50-50, it's going to look and feel recessionary to a lot of people is the bottom line.\"",
