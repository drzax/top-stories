              "plaintext": "The government is rushing to save its plan to allow patients to buy two months' worth of medicine at pharmacies after the Opposition urged the Senate to tear it up. The move, which could see 6 million Australians able to collect two months' worth of medicine for the price of one, is set to take effect from September 1. Health Minister Mark Butler says it's one of the government's key cost-of-living measures. He said many Australians were having to make difficult choices between paying their rent, mortgages, putting food on the table and considering when they could afford the medication they need. The Pharmacy Guild, is heavily against the move with concerns it could mean community pharmacies go under. The Coalition says the government hasn't properly consulted the sector on the proposal. The opposition is set to move a disallowance motion in the Senate today, trying to use the upper house to block the proposal from occurring. This will happen unless the government agrees to renegotiate a funding agreement with the community pharmacy sector. ABC Political reporter Matt Doran told News Breakfast the debate would come down to the cross bench, after the Greens took Labor's side. This is the final day that such a parliamentary manoeuvre can be used before parliament breaks for three weeks.",

It might be hard to believe that an electricity and gas company could possibly lose money given current power bills, but that's exactly what AGL did last year. It's reported a $1, 264 million net statutory loss for financial year 2023, which just ended on June 30. How did it lose so much money? There's two main reasons: It wrote down the value of its coal power plants by $680 million after deciding to close some of them earlier than previously planned. It lost $890 million from the value of various financial instruments, mostly futures contracts for electricity, after government intervention and market forces caused the wholesale price of power to drop dramatically late last year. AGL was stuck with contracts that were above the new market pricing. Excluding those write-downs, AGL's underlying net profit after tax was $281 million, up 25%. And if you think that still sounds small in a sector where retail prices have just jumped by around 20-30%, then don't worry, AGL is about to make up for it. It has reiterated its forecasts for an underlying net profit of between $580 and $780 million for the current 2024 financial year. That is somewhere between double and nearly triple this year's profit. As a 'gentailer' — a power generator who also retails to customers — AGL is benefitting from \"sustained periods of higher wholesale electricity pricing\" and expected improved power plant availability, with less forced outages. However, it says inflation, difficulty collecting debts of some customers and increased maintenance spend will cap profit growth. This blog covered AGL's June announcement about its updated profit forecasts, below.",
