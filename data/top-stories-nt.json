The stop orders relate to pet insurance products issued by the insurance via brands including: Woolworths RSPCA Petbarn Guide Dogs Medibank Bpua HCF The interim orders prohibit the insurers from engaging in retail product distribution in respect of the products for new customers. The orders are valid for 21 days unless revoked earlier. ASIC made the interim orders to protect consumers from acquiring pet insurance products that may not be consistent with their objectives, financial situation or needs. ASIC has issued the stop orders because of deficiencies in the target market determinations (TMD) for the products. The regulator says it's considering more stop orders for other insurance products. ASIC says it was concerned that the insurers did not appear to properly consider whether the key terms, features and attributes of the products would be consistent with the objectives, financial situation and needs of consumers in the target market. In particular, in defining the target market, it appears that the insurers did not properly consider the requirement for consumers to pay for veterinary expenses in full and upfront before receiving a partial reimbursement under a claim. ASIC says it expects the insurers to consider the concerns raised regarding the TMDs and take immediate steps to ensure compliance. It will consider making a final order if the concerns are not addressed in a timely manner. The insurers will have an opportunity to make submissions before a decision is made about any final stop orders.",
