Where are we going to go? \"We went to the mosques, they struck the mosques. We went to the schools, they struck them too. \"We only found Shifa [hospital] to find refuge. We thought it would be a safe place, but it also turned out not to be safe.\" She said last night she was sleeping outside the hospital under a tree with a group of people when they were woken around 3am by people warning them to find safety. \"We are calling on all the Arab countries if they had an ounce of conscience and an ounce of humanity and an ounce of bravery to stand with the Palestinian people in Gaza.\"",

It brings us closer to achieving that Australian national aspiration, 'A fair go for all'. \"We do not presume to speak for Charlie Perkins, who left us 23 years ago. But Charlie was always a passionate voice for his people, and he knew how vital it was that Indigenous Australians had a voice to speak for them. As some of those who had the privilege to accompany him on the Freedom Ride all those many years ago, we will be voting YES in his honour.\"",

It's often seen as one of the more progressive states and for a while it was one of a few that was leaning towards a Yes majority in the polls. That's now changed, according to all but one opinion poll. They're now projecting a No vote will win in Victoria. It's worth noting opinion polls have their limitation and can be wrong (and have been in the past). I spoke to Victorian lobbyist and pollster Kos Samaras about why there has been a shift in the state. He told me it's being driven by Melbourne's outer suburbs, where the Yes campaign has been less visible (compared to inner city suburbs where the Yes vote is much higher) and where some voters aren't finding the case for voting Yes succinct or clear enough. Additionally, he said some areas with higher migrant populations in the state were only being handed campaign pamphlets in English. And Kos said that when people don't understand, they're more likely to vote No. But the Yes campaign is staying positive and they are hopeful the many undecided voters will be swayed towards a Yes in the coming days. I'll have more on 7.30 tonight.",
