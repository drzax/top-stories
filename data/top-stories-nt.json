Emergency crews were called to fires in grassland near Waltham Court, Bonogin Road and Brighton Lane between 2:45pm and 4:10pm yesterday. Initial investigations indicate the fires were deliberately lit. Anyone who was in the area or who has dashcam footage, is urged to contact police. The federal Emergency Services Minister Murray Watt says arsonists are putting people in danger. \"It is so unfortunate that every fire season we see absolute nongs going around deliberately lighting fires that put other people at risk, of course if these people are caught they will be charged.\"",

Colonel Jonathan Conricus, IDF's international spokesperson, confirmed they were behind a deadly air strike, which they claim has killed a top Hamas commander. \"There was no strike on a refugee camp,\" he told ABC's Patricia Karvelas. \"We targeted a Hamas battalion commander, a very important combatant who was leading combat operations against us. \"He was hiding together with many of his terrorists, his combatants in a tunnel complex underneath civilian houses, underneath the street.\" Earlier, we reported that an IDF statement said the strike on Jabalia, Gaza's largest refugee camp, had killed Ibrahim Biari. Hamas spokesperson Hazem Qassem has denied any senior commander was there and called the claim an Israeli pretext for killing civilians. \"I can confirm that he has been killed, and so have many terrorists. That was the aim of what we have done,\" Colonel Conricus told the ABC. \"I understand that there are reports of civilian casualties. I want to emphasise the civilians are not our targets – we focus on Hamas. \"And it is because of Hamas practices of using women and children and civilians as their human shields that there are casualties.\" The Hamas-run health ministry and a hospital director say at least 50 civilians were also killed. UN Special Rapporteur for the Palestinian Territories, Francesca Albanese, responded directly to the claim, saying the Israeli strike on Jabalia could constitute a crime against humanity. \"A refugee camp inhabited by 400 cannot be a legitimate military target, and this cannot be justified. If it is it might be an extermination, which constituted a crime against humanity under international law,\" she told RN Breakfast. Follow the link below to listen to the interview:",

According to Refinitiv data, markets are now pricing about a two-thirds chance of the RBA hiking next Tuesday. Bloomberg data has those odds closer to 56% for a rate hike, but also indicates that markets have almost fully priced in two more hikes by the middle of next year to take the cash rate to 4.6%, not just one and done. Expectations of longer term risk free interest rates are even higher, with the Australian 10-year bond closing in on passing 5% for the first time since 2011. The Australian 10-year bond (white line) has now punched above the US benchmark rate (blue line), as local rate expectations are now higher than those for further Federal Reserve rate hikes. The Fed is currently meeting, with the outcome to be announced tomorrow morning Australian time. The current target Fed funds rate in the US is 5.25-5.5%. The market is pricing in almost no chance of a rate rise at this meeting, and just 25% at the December meeting. It's also pricing in a slim chance of rate cuts as early as March and the likelihood of rate cuts by July next year.",

Using its annual report into the Australian economy, the fund said that although inflation was easing, it was still too high. The RBA board meets next Tuesday, with most economists and financial markets forecasting that the cash rate will be increased by 0.25 per cent to a 12-year high of 4.35 per cent. The fund said while fiscal policy was working in line with monetary policy, higher interest rates would be necessary to bring down inflation, which has eased to 5.4 per cent but remains well above the RBA's 2 to 3 per cent target band. \"While headline inflation has peaked, its decline is slow and core inflation remains sticky,\" the IMF said in a statement. \"The authorities have implemented several policy measures which have significantly contributed to stabilizing the economy and reducing inflation, but staff assess that more is needed to bring inflation back to target and keep inflation expectations anchored. \"Continued coordination between fiscal and monetary policy is key to achieving a soft landing, while alleviating the impact of policy tightening on vulnerable households.\" It called on the federal government and state and territory governments to \"implement public investment projects at a more measured and coordinated pace, given supply constraints, to alleviate inflationary pressures and support the RBA's disinflation efforts\". \"Otherwise, interest rates would have to be even higher, putting the burden of adjustment disproportionately on mortgage holders,\" it said. Building on recent reforms, it said policymakers should continue their efforts to address climate change and need to do more to boost productivity.",
