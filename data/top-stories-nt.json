Yesterday Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu raised the prospect of Israel taking control of the administration of the Gaza Strip once Hamas is defeated. \"Clearly Israel is going to have to exercise ultimate security control over the Gaza strip, because we saw what happened when we don't\", Eylon Levy, spokesperson for the Israeli government, told Patricia Karvelas on RN Breakfast when asked to comment on Netanyahu's words. He said he could not go into detail on what \"ultimate security control\" would mean, but said the Gaza strip would have to be demilitarised. The last 20 years since Israel withdrew its troops and settlers from the Gaza Strip were a \"failed experiment\", he said. When asked by about US officials' comments against an Israeli occupation of Gaza, Levy elaborated: \"When we talk about ultimate security for the Gaza strip, we are not talking about Israeli soldiers necessarily patrolling inside and being there all the time. \"We're going to need mechanisms and safeguards to ensure that the area is not taken over by terrorists the way that it has been over the last 20 years.\" Listen to the full interview on ABC RN Breakfast below.",

At least 500 people, most of them foreigners or dual nationals and their dependents passed through Rafah, the only crossing that does not border Israel, Egyptian security sources said. Evacuations through the crossing were suspended on Saturday and Sunday after an Israeli strike on an ambulance that was heading to Rafah. Egyptian security sources said Egypt was continuing to press for increased aid and fuel into the strip and security for ambulances. Jordan's foreign ministry said 262 Jordanians were evacuated on Tuesday, out of a total of 569 that had been stuck in Gaza following the outbreak of fighting there. Canada said 59 of its citizens, permanent residents and family members were evacuated. Nineteen Gazans needing medical treatment were also allowed through, a medical source said, to join dozens of others who are being treated in Egyptian hospitals. Other countries with citizens cleared to leave on Tuesday included Romania, Germany, Moldova, Ukraine, the Philippines and France, according to the Gaza border authority. Reporting with Reuters",

The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) launched legal action against the airline in August, accusing Qantas of failing to address accusations it sold thousands of tickets for cancelled flights between May and July 2022. The watchdog alleges Qantas engaged in false, misleading, or deceptive conduct by advertising and selling tickets for more than 8000 \"ghost flights\" which had already been cancelled. It alleges that the airline kept selling tickets on its website for an average of more than two weeks, and in some cases for up to 47 days, after the cancellation of the flights. The consumer watchdog also alleges that for more than 10,000 flights scheduled to depart in May to July 2022, Qantas did not notify existing ticketholders that their flights had been cancelled for an average of about 18 days, and in some cases for up to 48 days. Qantas has denied breaking consumer laws, saying while it \"fully accepts it let customers down during the post-COVID restart, including with high cancellation rates\" and \"while mistakes were made, the ACCC's legal case ignores the realities of the aviation industry — airlines can't guarantee specific flight times\". The court heard the parties will aim to agree on the facts of the case before holding a hearing on the question of Qantas' liability next year. At a brief case management hearing in Melbourne on Wednesday, it was agreed they will return to the court on February 28 next year. The ACCC is seeking orders in the Federal Court for the alleged misconduct, including penalties, injunctions, declarations, and costs. The controversy has seen Qantas's share price take a hit in recent months and at its annual general meeting last week shareholders delivered a significant protest vote against the board's plan for executive pay, with 83 per cent of shareholders voting against management plans.",

Bloomberg data show financial markets pricing in no chance of a rate hike next month and about a 34% chance of a rate hike in February. The market is pricing in a cash rate below the current 4.35% target by November next year. The Australian dollar has fallen half a cent from around 64.8 US cents just ahead of yesterday's rates announcement to 64.3 this morning. Saxo Asia-Pacific market strategist Charu Chanana says many traders are of the view that the RBA is now done with rate rises, as are most other developed economy central banks. \"What is clear from (yesterday's) meeting is that the RBA is done — the market will look to price in rate cuts now for next year. \"Any softening in data will push the rate cut pricing to H1 [first half] or even Q1 [first quarter] next year. \"As such, AUD [Australian dollar] has seen the end of gains driven by the RBA pricing. From here on, China's recovery will become the key driver for AUD once again, along with the global risk sentiment.\"",
