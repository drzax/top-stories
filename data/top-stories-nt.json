Former RBA economist and now economics lecturer Dr Zac Gross has penned an interesting article on his blog about why some of those market measures may currently be skewed and slightly understating the market odds for a rate hike. \"The crux of the issue lies in the contractual language of the interbank cash rate futures the foundation of the ASX's published probabilities,\" Dr Gross explains. \"The cash rate futures pay out according to the value of the cash rate averaged over the calendar month — not what the RBA actually targets the cash rate to be. \"Historically the actual cash rate has tracked the target very closely. For instance, if the RBA aims for a cash rate of 4.10%, the monthly average cash rate would typically aligned almost exactly with that 4.10% target. But the introduction of quantitative easing has disrupted this close sure fire aim. The gap between the target cash rate and its actual average opened up during COVID as shown in the bottom panel of the chart below. \"The RBA's recent note on this issue highlights that this gap has reduced to an average of 3 basis points and predicts it will eventually revert to zero once quantitative tightening is fully implemented. \"This seemingly minor gap of 3 basis points can significantly alter the probabilities when determining the likelihood of a 25 basis point movement in the cash rate, a standard unit for an interest rate adjustment. \"Incorporating this spread into the ASX's calculations, the probability shifts from an even 50-50 implied probability to a 65% likelihood of a rate hike .\" It is not clear how this affects the Refinitiv and Bloomberg calculations on interest rate probability, typically used by us at the ABC, and which themselves usually differ slightly between each other. You can read Zac's full post on his blog .",

Mr Chalmers responded to last week's Consumer Price Index (CPI) by saying it hadn't \"materially\" altered the outlook for inflation. That was the day after RBA governor Michele Bullock had delivered a speech at a Commonwealth Bank hosted event saying: \"The board will not hesitate to rate the cash rate further if there is a material upward revision to the outlook for inflation.\" But this morning Mr Chalmers said he was referring to Treasury forecasts about inflation, which had not changed significantly after the latest CPI data, while the Reserve Bank is independent and will arrive at its own set of forecasts. \"Treasury was already preparing for a modest revision of the near-term inflation forecasts before last week's new numbers, recognising the upward pressure which came from earlier decisions by global oil producers to wind back supply,\" Mr Chalmers told the audience at the beginning of a speech that was otherwise about the clean energy transition. \"In particular, global oil prices have remained higher than Treasury had expected since the end of the September quarter. \"Combined with the escalating conflict in the Middle East, this means that inflation is likely to be more volatile in the near term. \" But there was nothing additional or unexpected in the September quarter CPI which materially altered Treasury's expectations for when inflation will return to the target band. \"Which is why I said the September quarter result didn't represent a material change to Treasury's outlook for inflation – While being really careful not to speak for the Reserve Bank, which will come to its own view on the outlook for inflation, independently and appropriately and in time. \"That independence is important, which is why I'm implementing the RBA Review recommendations which seek to strengthen it.\" Mr Chalmers said he has a constructive relationship with the new RBA governor, who he appointed in July to take over the role when Philip Lowe's term ended in September. \" The Governor and I talk regularly, we met again on Tuesday – \"And we've been working closely together: bedding down the response to the RBA Review; renewing our approach to full employment; ensuring fiscal and monetary policy are complementary, not in conflict.\"",
