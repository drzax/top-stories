It's an unlikely suspect to be bridging the gender pay gap — but that's exactly what's happening after the company made deliberate changes to get more women into roles traditionally dominated by men. The company has since narrowed its gender pay gap to just 9.9% — less than half of what it is at most businesses in Australia. So how have they done it, and are other companies going to follow suit before mandatory reporting comes into effect next year? My colleague, business reporter Daniel Ziffer took a closer look at how the gender pay gap can be fixed, and you can read his story below:",
