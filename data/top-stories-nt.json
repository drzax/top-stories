One of today's keynote speakers was Kenneth Hayne, the former High Court justice who presided over the banking and financial services royal commissio n of 2018. Mr Hayne spent a great deal of his keynote address focused on the issue of remuneration and its connection to misconduct. \"Income, profit and sales can all be measured and monitored, but compliance with the law and ethics cannot be measured in the same ways,\" he observed. \"If an individual is remunerated according to income or profit generated, or sales made, the individual's pursuit of higher remuneration may swamp other relevant considerations including considerations of compliance with the law and compliance with basic standards of probity.\" Mr Hayne same back to the topic later in his address. \"Remuneration and incentives tell employees what an entity values. Remuneration both affects and reflects culture.\" They say he who pays the piper calls the tune, but it's also true that how he pays them affects the way in which they play.",
