The coalition has called for an increase of five to 10 hours to the time people on JobSeeker can work before their payment benefits are removed. As AAP reports, Dutton says the opposition proposal amounts to about half the cost of the government's plan to boost JobSeeker payments by $40 a fortnight. The opposition leader says the coalition is yet to formally consider whether it will support the government's $40-a-fortnight boost to JobSeeker. However, he is hopeful there will be cross-party support for lifting the working hours threshold. \"We want a discussion with the government to properly consider what we're putting forward because it's put forward in a genuine spirit of bipartisanship,\" he tells ABC Radio. \"We want to see the government properly consider what it is we're putting forward before we say what the next step is, and it's a lot of money … any policy change within the welfare space is expensive.\"",

According to a court filing, the Virgin Islands issued a subpoena to Musk on April 28. The filing says Musk, one of the richest people in the world, may have been referred to JPMorgan by Epstein. Musk is yet to comment. The US Virgin Islands accuses JPMorgan of missing red flags about Epstein's abuse of women on Little St. James, a private island he owned there. The bank says it should not be held liable for a former top executive's relationship with Epstein, who was found to have died by suicide in 2019 in a Manhattan jail cell while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. The subpoena is calling for all communications between the entrepreneur and JPMorgan regarding Epstein as well as communications between Musk and Epstein. The subpoena also sought all documents regarding fees that Musk paid to Epstein or to JPMorgan. It also asked Musk for all documents reflecting or regarding Epstein's involvement in human trafficking and his procurement of girls or women for commercial sex. Musk was pictured with Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein's confidante, at a 2014 Vanity Fair Oscars Party. But Musk in 2020 tweeted that he did not know Maxwell, and she \"photobombed\" the billionaire at the event.",

              "plaintext": "Microsoft has won EU antitrust approval for its $US69 billion acquisition of video game maker publisher Activision. It's a significant boost that could prompt Chinese and South Korean regulators to follow suit — despite UK regulators blocking the deal. It has until May 24 to appeal a decision by Britain's Competition & Markets Authority (CMA) to block it. A final decision may take months. The US Federal Trade Commission's case against the deal is also pending at the agency, though Japan approved it in March. The European Commission said the transaction was pro-competition due to Microsoft's agreement to licence popular Activision games such as \"Call of Duty\" to rival game streaming platforms. Such licences are \"practical and effective\", Europen Union antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager told reporters. \"Actually they significantly improve the condition for cloud game streaming compared to the present situation, which is why we actually consider them pro-competitive,\" she added, contrasting with the UK position that the deal would hit competition in that part of the market. In rejecting the deal, the UK watchdog was seen as flexing its muscle on the global regulatory stage since Brexit. Microsoft has in recent months signed licensing deals with Nvidia, Nintendo, Ukraine's Boosteroid and Japan's Ubitus to bring Activision games to their platforms should the deal go through. \"The European Commission has required Microsoft to license popular Activision Blizzard games automatically to competing cloud gaming services,\" said Microsoft President Brad Smith. \"This will apply globally and will empower millions of consumers worldwide to play these games on any device they choose.\" Activision's shares closed 1.2% higher, while Microsoft's were little changed.",

Wall Street's main indexes finished trading with modest gains after the latest manufacturing data came in much worse than expected and raised concerns about a potential recession in the United States. The New York Federal Reserve's \"Empire State\" index, a gauge of manufacturing activity in New York State on current business conditions, tumbled to a reading of -31.8 points in May, against expectations of -3.75. \"This is always tough because we are in a period now where bad news is actually good news from a stocks standpoint and vice versa,\" said Tim Ghriskey, senior portfolio strategist at Ingalls & Snyder in New York. \"But you still get the market reacting when you get a bad number because everybody then begins to worry about a recession. \"So we want the economy to be weak enough to bring down inflation but not so weak that it causes a recession.\" Analysts cautioned that the barometer is also volatile, lessening its impact. Slowing economic data has heightened expectations for when the US Federal Reserve will pause its interest rate hike cycle as the central bank tries to stamp out high inflation. The Dow Jones and S & P 500 rose by 0.1% and 0.3% respectively, while the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.7%. Also keeping markets subdued was the wrangling in Washington between the White House and Republicans in debt-ceiling talks, with a meeting scheduled for Tuesday (local time), although it was unlikely a deal would be reached then. \"We’ve been through this before, eventually they come to their senses and do something, compromise and actually get something done instead of playing this game of chicken, it’s really who blinks first,\" Mr Ghriskey said.",
