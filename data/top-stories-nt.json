It is worth noting that central banks in most advanced economies have also been increasing interest rates for the same reasons. \"So, Australia is not alone here. \"The Board is very conscious that monetary policy operates with a lag and that the full effects of the tightening to date have not yet been felt. \"It takes time for households and businesses to adjust their spending and investment plans, and there are still significant resets of low fixed-rate loans to come. \"Given the lags, economic growth is expected to be subdued over the next couple of years and it will take time for inflation to return to target.\"",
