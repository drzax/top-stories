The consultancy firm, which was also employed by the former government, is under fire for the leaking of confidential Australian government information related to tax changes for large multinational corporations, which it shared with some of its clients. Here's what Littleproud said when asked on News Breakfast if he or members of the former government accepted any responsibility for the ballooning use of consultants, and the capping of public servant numbers: \"I think it's about balance, it's about a place for these consultants. What you can do is move with agility to be able to get a more cost effective way to bring in skills that the department doesn't have on a temporary basis. \"That means that you can get the advice, take the advice, where that couldn't be sort from the departmentmental people that you had. \"With respect, I think it's the actions of PwC subsequent to that. I think this is about where, in balancing budgets, you need to understand you're using Australian taxpayers' money and you have to do that efficiently and if you're able to be able to do that by bringing people in on a temporary basis to get the skill sets you don't have in the department and don't need full-time, that's common sense. \"But it's about making sure it's done in balance and done to the right extent, and then the actions of PwC show there should be actions taken against them for what they've done. \"I think it also demonstrates we should go further and beyond this unholy alliance. It's not just our sides. It's both sides have had, with the big four accounting firms. \"We need to think more laterally. Not all the wisdom of the world sits within the big four. Some of the smaller firms out there also have many people that could bring those skills to the Australian bureaucracy on the temporary basis that brings in greater competition and diversity of ideas that the departments and ministers are looking for.\"",

Philip Lowe will take questions at a Senate estimates hearing on a variety of matters, but the pathway for interest rates will likely dominate discussions. From May 2022, the RBA lifted interest rates 10 times in a row before pausing in April, as it aimed to slow inflation. The central bank board then opted to lift interest rates by another 25 basis points in May — a move that few were expecting after keeping rates on hold for just one month. New inflation figures are also out at 11:30am AEST today, from the Bureau of Statistics. Expectations are for a 6.4 per cent uptick in headline inflation in April, up from 6.3 per cent in March. While past its 7 per cent peak, inflation remains well above its two-to-three per cent target range. Our Business team will have all the latest on both in their upcoming live blog.",

From May 2022, the RBA lifted interest rates 10 times in a row before pausing in April, as it aimed to slow inflation. The central bank board then opted to lift interest rates by another 25 basis points in May — a move that few were expecting after keeping rates on hold for just one month. New inflation figures are also out at 11:30am AEST today, from the Bureau of Statistics.

That's the question being asked by investors about the agreement between US president Joe Biden and Republican house speaker Kevin McCarthy about the deal to allow the US government to borrow more money.

Mr Biden and Mr McCarthy are lobbying to get votes, with some lawmakers pledging to oppose the agreement, which temporarily suspends the debt ceiling and caps some federal government spending. Mr McCarthy said overnight that the deal should be \"easy\" for Republicans to vote for and was likely to pass, but some right-wing Republicans said they opposed the agreement.
