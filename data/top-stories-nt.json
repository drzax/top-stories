But behind the scenes, the league is looking into whether a referee has used a Twitter account to defend themself and other officials from online critiques. Eric Lewis, who had been chosen to officiate the finals in each of the last four NBA seasons, was not selected as one of the 12 referees for this year's finals. After some now-deleted tweets were revealed by a pair of Twitter users last week, the league opened an investigation into whether Lewis violated NBA rules by speaking about officiating in an unauthorised manner. It has not been determined if Lewis was using the account, which used the name \"blair cuttliff\". \"Regarding Eric Lewis and the social media posts, we are continuing to review the matter and he will not be working the finals,\" NBA spokesman Mike Bass says. It remains unknown what discipline from the league that Lewis could face if he broke policy by discussing officiating matters openly without approval.",
