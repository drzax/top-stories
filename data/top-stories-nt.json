China's National Bureau of Statistics says consumer prices dropped 0.3 per cent in July from a year ago, the first decline since February 2021. That's because of lower prices for food and consumer goods. However, the monthly Consumer Price Index rose 0.2 per cent from June. Producer prices — the prices received by producers for their goods — fell for the 10th month in a row, down 4.4 per cent from a year ago. Trade figures out yesterday showed that Chinese imports and exports slumped from July last year. China's economy is slowing down after the end of COVID restrictions earlier in the year boosted the economy. Commonwealth Bank's currency strategist Carol Kong says she expects more stimulus from the Chinese government to be rolled out including further interest rate cuts. \"Fading base effects and the government’s recently announced support measures suggest CPI deflation in July may be short‑lived. \"Nevertheless, we consider further easing measures are needed to support consumer demand and counter deflationary pressures.\"",
