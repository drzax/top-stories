They continue to warn that geopolitical events risk overtaking, and overwhelming, financial ones. \"Even the Federal Reserve now warns of growing geopolitical risks to the global financial system,\" they note. \"And if they are finally prepared to talk about it, markets should be concerned. \"This is going to be a very tense week. And, sadly, it's hard to see a realistic off-ramp. \"The confluence of risks in the Middle East threatens a geopolitical chain reaction that has the potential to make monetary reactions look like small beer by comparison.\" Not that there aren't some potentially worrying financial developments either. Japanese inflation finally looks to be escaping the doldrums, prompting noises that the Bank of Japan will gradually edge further away from its aggressive policies to keep interest rates ultra low. \"Evaporating monetary easing from the Bank of Japan comes at a delicate moment,\" they observe. \"The USA is running colossal deficits to finance their guns and butter spending, China is selling Treasuries to defend the CNY, and Argentina *could* be poised to elect a Libertarian President who has promised to dollarise the economy. \" The threat of a global liquidity squeeze raises questions for markets where fragilities have already been exposed by the UK pension blowup and the mini banking crisis in the USA and Switzerland. \"A scramble for cash is underway, which probably means that somebody is going to miss out. \"What does that mean for emerging markets that the USA needs to keep in the geopolitical tent? \"If the BOJ retracts the control rod of yield curve control from the monetary reactor core, will this set off a chain reaction in bond markets that will break something else?\" You can listen to more of what Michael Every has to say when he speaks with Kirsten Aiken by tuning into The Business on ABC News channel at 8:45pm AEDT or watching back on iView.",
