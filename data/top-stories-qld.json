He was told to go home and change clothes if he wanted to cast his ballot. \"We were just going around peacefully, doing our business to vote,\" Mr Brown said. In a statement, a spokesperson encouraged voters to not wear campaign clothing, as the law states people cannot campaign within 6 metres of a polling station. \"If a voter simply wears campaign material (ie a pin or shirt) into the polling place, casts their vote and leaves, it likely won't contravene the act,\" the AEC spokesperson said. \"However, if the voter wears that material into a polling place and is then seen talking with someone inside about it … that could be construed as campaigning.\"",

Speaking to ABC's Michael Rowland from Tel Aviv, Mark Regev said Saturday's attack was a declaration of war. \"The way they invaded, they butchered our people, killing innocent people in their homes, murdering children, what they did was a strategic attack on my country and they started this war and we will finish it,\" he said. Mr Ragev said while civilian casualties should be avoided at any cost, there was no way of avoiding it in this case. \"There hasn't been a war in recent history which hasn't involved collateral damage and civilians, unfortunately, getting killed,\" he said. \"If we can't hit them back, why would they stop?\" He added that Israel authorities were urging the civilian population of Gaza to move away from Hamas strongholds. \"They aren't our target, it is the Hamas military leadership and political structure,\" he said. \"That is the target. It is going to be a war and wars are messy and we will lose people ourselves.\" He said the sort of barbarism that was committed by Hamas on Saturday morning was \"reminiscent of ISIS-type terrorism\". \"We can no longer have our civilian population exposed to the sorts of barbarism violence that Hamas is capable of,\" he said.",
