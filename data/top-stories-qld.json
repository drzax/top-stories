Mr Speirs urged people to \"remain respectful and decent\" during the voting process. \"This is an important part of democracy and we ought to respect it and respect each other's views,\" he said. Mr Speirs said South Australians he had spoken to were \"confused\" about the Voice. \"They're really concerned about the serious lack of detail that has been put on the table by the prime minister. And the prime minister is going to have a lot of questions to answer on Sunday morning if, as predicted, the referendum is defeated across Australia,\" he said. Ms Liddle, an Arrernte woman, said people should focus on the facts when they make their decision, not emotion. \"It is about a whole new chapter in our constitution, in our nation's rulebook, and anything you do to our rulebook has consequences,\" she said. \"That's why Australians have been very careful historically in making any change to our rulebook — and they should be. \"And they should be really careful on this one too, because they shouldn't be voting on emotion. \"They shouldn't be voting because they feel like they're being intimidated, harassed, or ashamed or guilted. None of those things should come into play here.\"",

The group says the move is an attack on their right to demonstrate in solidarity with the people of Palestine, and it is important for them to express their views in the wake of the international community failing to intervene over the loss of human life in Gaza. Josh Lees from the Palestine Action Group says he believes the government wants to crack down on pro-Palestine protests because of \"Israel's plan to unleash atrocities on Gaza\". \"Mr Netanyahu himself said that we're only getting started. The Israeli defence minister called the Palestinian people animals and openly talked about carrying out a basic genocide in Gaza and our governments in the West are giving them carte blanche rearming them, like the United States announced this morning,\" he said. \"Our governments are complicit in the crimes that are about to be unleashed on the people of Gaza. That's why it is more important than ever the people come out to protest … This is a genocide we're talking about, that they will unleash on the people of Gaza, we have to keep protesting against that.\" Peter Slezak from Independent Jewish Voices says attempts to smear these rallies as anti-Semitic are wrong. \"I'm proud to stand as many Jews on behalf of the people who stand up for human rights and for international law to condemn what the state of Israel is doing with the complicity and the help of our own governments and the big powers around the world,\" he says.",
