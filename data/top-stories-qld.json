The ABC was not able to independently verify the situation. No comment was immediately available from the IDF. WAFA, the official Palestinian news agency, had earlier reported that Israeli forces raided the Shifa complex on Wednesday evening local time \"for the second time in 24 hours\". Bulldozers and military vehicles were used, the agency said, citing local sources. Hamas-affiliated Shehab news agency reported early on Thursday that Israeli tanks raided Al Shifa from the complex's southern side and that gunfire was heard in the area. The Israeli army said it found military equipment including weapons in their raid on the hospital. A video shared by the IDF on X showed automatic weapons, grenades, ammunition and flak jackets it said were recovered from a hospital building. The ABC could not verify the claims made in the video. \"The troops continue to search the hospital in a precise, intelligence-based, manner,\" army spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari had said at a press briefing late on Wednesday. \"We will continue to do so, in order to gather further information, to discover additional assets, and to expose the terror activities within the hospital.\" The director of the health ministry in Gaza rejected the Israeli claims, saying in a statement there were no weapons at the facility. The Israeli military made no mention of finding any tunnel entrances in Al Shifa. It previously said Hamas had built a network of tunnels under the hospital, which Hamas has denied, alongside the latest IDF statements. \"The occupation forces are still lying â¦ as they brought some weapons, clothes and tools and placed them in the hospital in a scandalous manner,\" Qatar-based Hamas senior member Ezzat El Rashq said. \"We have repeatedly called for a committee from the United Nations, the World Health Organization and the Red Cross to verify the lies of the occupation.\" The Qatari foreign ministry denounced the raid as a \"war crime\", and called for \"an urgent international investigation\" into \"the targeting of hospitals by the Israeli occupation army\".",

Looking at the sectors, seven are in the red: academic and eduational services (-1.6%), energy (-0.8%), real estate (-0.6%), financials (-0.5%), basic materials (-0.3%), technology (-0.2%) and consumer cyclicals (-0.1%). In terms of sector gains, consumer non-cyclicals and utilities are both up 0.4%, followed by industrials at 0.2%. Healthcare is flat. The biggest mover in either direction is AMP, which has fallen by 15% so far today after it downgraded its margin expectations. Graincorp is continuing to rally throughout the session, after announcing a $50 million buyback and reporting a smaller profit of $250 million in the year to September 30.

Some of the projects are: The Geelong Fast Rail Sydney to Newcastle faster rail upgrade Truro Bypass New England Highway project Commuter car parks in NSW and Queensland Funding for a number of projects has been unaffected, including: The Melbourne Airport Rail Link The Milton-Ulladulla Bypass The Tasman Bridge The government is also tipping in extra funding for 11 projects, including: South Australia: North-South Corridor Queensland: Logan-Gold Coast Faster Rail WA: Metronet Infrastructure Minister Catherine King said the projects that were cut did not have a realistic chance of being delivered with the available funding, had made little or no progress, or did not fit in with national priorities. \"From now on, the Australian government's investment infrastructure will focus on productivity, sustainability and liveability,\" she said.

So what's behind the increase? Here's an explanation from Bjorn Jarvis, who is the head of labour statistics with the ABS: \"With employment increasing by 55,000 people, and the number of unemployed people increasing by 28,000, the unemployment rate rose to 3.7% in October,\" he said. \"The large increase in employment in October followed a small increase in September of around 8,000 people. \"Looking over the past two months, these increases equate to average employment growth of around 31,000 people a month, which is slightly lower than the average growth of 35,000 people a month since October 2022.\" The participation rate also rose by 0.2 percentage points to 67% â suggesting there are more people who are actively looking for work. Mr Jarvis also said there could be signs that the labour market is starting to slow, with a much smaller gap between the growth rate of hours worked and employment growth. \"Compared with the labour market just before the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, the growth in hours worked was still greater than employment, at 10% and 9.2%,\" he said. \"However, the gap between them had recently narrowed, having been much higher for most of the period from October 2022 to August 2023. \" The recent slowdown in the growth of hours worked may suggest that the labour market is starting to slow, following a particularly strong period of growth.\"",
