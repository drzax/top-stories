              "plaintext": "Treasurer Jim Chalmers says the federal government is not considering a temporary cut to the fuel excise, despite inflation data showing fuel prices saw their highest quarterly rise since March 2022. The federal government charges 49 cents a litre on petrol purchased at the bowser, as part of a fuel excise. The previous Coalition government temporarily halved the tax in March last year for six months, after Russia's invasion of Ukraine caused a massive global spike in oil prices. The current government opted not to extend the excise cut when it expired last September, with government estimates suggesting the temporary cut resulted in about $5.6 billion of lost tax revenue during those six months. But when asked today if the government was looking at reducing the excise to ease cost-of-living pressures, Mr Chalmers said it's currently not on the table. \"Obviously in future budgets we will contemplate what measures are necessary in our economy consistent with our strict approach to fiscal discipline,\" he replied. \"But it's not something we have been working on now.\"",

              "plaintext": "There's a few questions coming in asking if fuel is the only reason for the acceleration in the consumer price index (or inflation) over the three months to September. Fuel was by far the biggest factor, but there's plenty more contributing to the increase — so let's break them down. What were the most significant contributors? Fuel prices, up 7.2% (The highest quarterly rise since March 2022) Electricity, up 4.2% Insurance, up 2.3% Rents, up 2.2% (Annual rental prices rose 7.6%, the largest increase since 2009) New house purchases, up 1.3% What was behind their increases? Fuel: Higher global oil prices Electricity: Higher wholesale prices being passed onto customers since July, partially offset by Energy Bill Relief rebates from July Insurance: Higher premiums for house, house contents and motor vehicle insurance Rents: Low vacancy rates, but moderated by increases in Commonwealth Rent Assistance New house purchases: Builders passing on labour and material costs Were there any falls? Yes — there were offsets during the September quarter for child care, fruit and vegetables, and domestic holiday travel and accommodation Child care fell 13.2%, after changes to the Child Care Subsidy increased the amount received by more than a million families in July Fruit and vegetables saw price falls of 3.7% because of favourable growing conditions Domestic holiday travel and accommodation fell 2.5% as there were no school holidays in August, reducing demand for airfares and accommodation It's also worth pointing out that the ABS says those significant contributors to inflation could have seen even higher increases had there not been support measures in place. The ABS's head of price statistics, Michelle Marquardt, says the rent assistance reduced the overall rent increases by 0.3%, while electricity prices would have increased 18.6% in the September quarter without the Energy Bill Relief rebates. Similarly, childcare prices would have increased 6.7% without the Child Care Subsidy reducing out-of-pocket costs for households.",
