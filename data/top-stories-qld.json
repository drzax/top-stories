He was told to go home and change clothes if he wanted to cast his ballot. \"We were just going around peacefully, doing our business to vote,\" Mr Brown said. In a statement, a spokesperson encouraged voters to not wear campaign clothing, as the law states people cannot campaign within six metres of a polling station. \"If a voter simply wears campaign material (ie. a pin or shirt) into the polling place, casts their vote and leaves, it likely won't contravene the act,\" the AEC spokesperson said. \"However, if the voter wears that material into a polling place and is then seen talking with someone inside about it … that could be construed as campaigning.\"",
