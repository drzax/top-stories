Israel summoned roughly 360,000 reservists to join the fight against Hamas after the attack on October 7. Many of them were living overseas and they dropped everything to return home. The ABC met up with Australian-Israeli Yaacov Travitz in Jerusalem. He was in Australia when the attack happened, and immediately hopped on a plane. \"I was not expecting to come back to fight. I hate fighting. I'm over it. I spent a lot of my life fighting, both in service as well as afterwards in private security. I thought I was done with it but I felt like I was needed and my talents could be put to good use to protect people. \" Yaacov's daughter lives in Jerusalem with his ex-partner, and being here for her was also a big reason for him to come back. \"My hope is that I can keep her safe for long enough until this is over. And then everything goes back to normal, she goes to school, her mum goes to work. And everything just goes back to normal, with people just trying to live without the hate, without the violence.\"",

It means we’ve been able to see the evidence of Israeli’s constant bombardment into the north – building after building that is damaged or completely destroyed. The whole area looks like a big grey pile of ash, because any of the buildings that are left standing are covered in concrete dust. It’s actually pretty eerie to look at. Almost every few seconds, we hear the battle unfolding on the ground. War planes fly overhead and then we hear a huge explosion – we see a massive plume of smoke rise into the sky. Another airstrike. Suddenly there are several loud bangs close by. Israeli tanks stationed near the Gaza border are firing from the ground into the Strip. I see several bright flashes of light, as artillery is fired. I can hear machine guns as Hamas militants are locked in gun battle with Israeli troops on the ground. It sounds like it’s coming from the north but we can’t be sure because the Israeli military isn’t really telling us a lot of information of what’s happening on the ground.",

              "plaintext": "An interesting report from the Regional Australia Institute and the Commonwealth Bank, based on CBA customer data that covers around 16 million Australians. It turns out that there are still more Aussies moving from the capital cities to the regions than vice versa, with recent years seeing the reversal of a decades long population drain from regional areas. \"In the 12 months to September 2023, capital to regional migration accounted for an 11% share of all relocations, compared to 9.1% making the move from the regions to the city,\" the report found. While newly arrived migrants from overseas overwhelmingly tend to settle in the big capitals, particularly Sydney and Melbourne, existing residents are still exiting the big smoke, especially Sydney. A stunning 80% of net capital city outflows came from Sydney, with a further 27% from Melbourne — the reason those two cities exceed 100% is that Brisbane (11%) and Perth (5%) are still attracting a lot of internal migrants. In terms of where these people are moving, it is often still reasonably close to home, with regional NSW now the most popular destination (39% of people who left a capital city moved there), followed by Queensland (33%) and Victoria (27%). As for exactly where people are moving, Queensland's Sunshine Coast continued to top the list, followed by Greater Geelong and the Gold Coast in a tie for second, then the Fraser Coast in Queensland and Moorabool in regional Victoria. Lake Macquarie in NSW is also among the most popular destinations for previous city dwellers. As for the biggest growth areas for city slickers to move to over the past year, Mackay in northern Queensland topped the list, along with Douglas and the Whitsundays from the same part of the world, with the Snowy Valleys in NSW and Ceduna in South Australia also making the list. \"The increasing popularity of these more remote regional growth hotspots, boosted by good regional job prospects and the likelihood of better house prices and availability, has seen some previously popular LGAs come off the boil,\" the report noted. \"For example, LGAs that had amongst the highest net internal migration inflows a year ago (to September 2022) but reported net outflows over the past 12 months include big regional New South Wales centres such as Wagga Wagga, Dubbo, Bathurst, Albury, Lismore, Newcastle, Byron and Orange as well as Mount Gambier in South Australia and West Tamar in Tasmania.\"",

              "plaintext": "New research from Roy Morgan shows a record high 1.57 million mortgage holders, representing 30.3 per cent of mortgage holders were \"at risk\" of mortgage stress in the three months to September. The figures, which cover the period of the three RBA meetings at which interest rates were left unchanged, represent a new record high — up 7,000 on a month ago. The number of Australians \"at risk\" of mortgage stress has increased by 766,000 since May 2022 when the RBA began a cycle of interest rate increases. The record high of 35.6 per cent of mortgage holders in mortgage stress was reached in mid-2008, during the global financial crisis. Other data released today by Core Logic, shows national home prices rose 0.9 per cent in October, with the biggest increases were in Perth (+1.6 per cent), Brisbane (+1.4 per cent) and Adelaide (+1.4 per cent). Ray Morgan says the number of mortgage holders considered \"extremely at risk\" — if even the \"interest only\" component of a loan is over a certain proportion of household income — is now numbered at 1.43 million (20.5 per cent) which is significantly above the long-term average over the last 15 years of 15.3 per cent. The RBA cash rate is currently at 4.10 per cent — the highest official interest rates since May 2012. Roy Morgan has modelled the impact of two potential RBA interest rate increases of 0.25 per cent in both November and December, which would take the cash rate to 4.6 per cent. It says the numbers of mortgage holders in stress would increase to 1.58 million, or 30.4 per cent — an increase of 8,000 — if the RBA increases interest rates next week. Then, if the RBA raises interest rates by a further 0.25 per cent in December to 4.6 per cent, there will be 31 per cent of mortgage holders, or 1.61 million considered \"at risk\" — an increase of 39,000. Ray Morgan CEO Michele Levine says the RBA left interest rates unchanged at its last four meetings, but with last month's inflation read higher, \"these pressures are adding to calls for the RBA to raise interest rates again and are a key factor for why we have modelled two further interest rate increases\". Mortgage stress is measured by when mortgage repayments are greater than a certain percentage of household income. Interest rates are only one of the variables that determines whether a mortgage holder is considered \"at risk\". The variable that has the largest impact on whether a borrower falls into the \"at risk\" category is related to household income — which is directly related to employment. \"If there is a sharp rise in unemployment, mortgage stress is set to increase even more,\" Ms Levine said.",
