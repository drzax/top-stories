Business conditions eased 1 point to 10 index points. Trading conditions, employment and profitability were all steady according to NAB chief economist Alan Oster. “Business conditions continued to show resilience in July and have been broadly steady in the past couple of months at above-average levels,\" he says. “Business confidence also picked up in July to be back in positive territory as well, although confidence remains low.” However, forward orders remain in negative territory, dragged down by the retail sector, and costs continue to rise for companies including for electricity and wages. “Labour cost growth rose sharply in July, likely reflecting wage rises taking effect on July 1 including minimum and award wage changes,” said Mr Oster. “Labour cost growth was strongest in recreation & personal services, transport & utilities, and retail, which aligns with where we would expect minimum and award wage workers to be most common.”",

Westpac and the Melbourne Institute says consumer sentiment dropped 0.4 per cent to 81 in August. A figure below 100 shows there are more pessimists than optimists. Westpac senior economist Matthew Hassan says the Reserve Bank interest rate pauses last month and this month have done little to lift confidence, probably because the RBA has warned that more rate rises may be needed. \"The August survey detail pointed to little or no impact from the RBA’s decision to pause. \" \"Responses showed no improvement over the course of survey week, sentiment instead declining 4.9 per cent between those surveyed prior to the RBA decision and those surveyed after.\" \"The sub-group detail also continued to show a disappointing reaction from the mortgage belt – sentiment amongst consumers with a mortgage down 7.2 per cent in the August month and, 0.8 per cent below its June level despite the two-month pause.\" \"Most consumers are still bracing for further rate rises with over two-thirds of those surveyed after the RBA decision expecting rates to move higher over the year ahead, nearly half of this group expecting a rise of over 1 percentage point.\" He says consumers are worried about inflation, including recent fuel and energy price rises, with pressure on family finances and concerns about rates and the economic outlook.",
