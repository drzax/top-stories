All three sisters came forward with abuse allegations against Leifer more than a decade ago. A jury found Leifer guilty of assaulting Ms Erlich and Ms Sapper, and not guilty of offences against Ms Meyer. Ms Erlich says as the judge outlined the profound vulnerability of her and her sister during the abuse, she felt again the \"pain of my younger self\". \"I could feel those emotions coming up as the judge was speaking, and then knowing that's not where we are anymore, that we were not powerless anymore,\" she says.",

Thanks for the question, Rick. I've passed this onto our global affairs editor John Lyons. He says: \"It's too early to tell how Wagner fighters will react to these developments. I think it depends whether a strong new leader emerges who is able to hold together the group. \"Also, if the Wagner fighters believe that Vladimir Putin was behind the crash then some may want to take revenge. But I think others will think that it's much safer to go back to Wagner's traditional business model – providing military services in Africa and Syria.\" The Institute for the Study of War, which has been monitoring the war in Ukraine since it began, has also just published its daily update — Prigozhin's presumed death is the headline news. It writes: \"Wagner PMC's future without a leader remains uncertain. A Russian news aggregator claimed that the Wagner council of commanders is currently meeting … to prepare a joint statement and announce what will happen to Wagner in the near future. \"Prigozhin and Utkin were undeniably the faces of Wagner, and their assassinations will have dramatic impacts on Wagner's command structure and the Wagner brand. \"Wagner commanders and fighters may begin to fear for their lives or become demoralised. The Russian Ministry of Defence and Kremlin's inroads into Wagner's operations and the absence of Prigozhin – who would fight for new opportunities for Wagner personnel – may further lead to the degradation of the Wagner grouping.\"",
