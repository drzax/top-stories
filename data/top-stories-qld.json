The Indigenous senator says the police failed to protect her and ministers from across the board including Prime Minister Anthony Albanese have condemned the abuse directed at Ms Thorpe. \"There is a question for the no campaign to answer about these sorts of extremists on the no side,\" says Yes vote advocate Thomas Mayo. He says it is an issue to be answered but people should not forget what the referendum is about. \"We can't be distracted. That sort of thing needs to be dealt with but this referendum is ultimately at the end of the day just about recognising Indigenous people by giving us a say,\" he said speaking on ABC News Breakfast. \"It is horrible to see that behaviour and those threats and it is something that we don't want to see in Australian politics.\" With just over a week left for the Voice to Parliament referendum vote, both sides are making the final push to secure more votes. \"We have just got to keep our focus on improving this country, building a better future for our children, for all Australians by saying yes,\" he says.",
