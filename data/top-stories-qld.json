However, he noted people still expect home prices to rise over the next year despite last week's rate hike. \"Despite the unexpected increase in the cash rate, expectations for house prices remained firmly positive,\" he said. \"Over 60 per cent of consumers expect prices to rise over the next 12 months.\"",
