The August statement has given more detail about why Australia's central bank chose to leave interest rates on hold this month, surprising many economists. One thing is clear — the decision not to raise rates further was again a close call. \"At both the July and August meetings, the board considered the option of raising rates further,\" the SOMP observed. \"The board's current assessment is that the risks around the inflation outlook are broadly balanced. \"But it recognises that the crystallisation of upside risks would increase the likelihood of inflation staying high for longer and a rise in medium-term inflation expectations.\"",

ANZ shares are up 0.6 per cent in early trade. Boss Shayne Elliott said ANZ is \"naturally disappointed and disagree with the ACCC's decision\". \"We believe the acquisition will improve competition, which will benefit Australian consumers, particularly in Queensland,\" Mr Elliott said in the ASX statement. ANZ also noted that decisions by the ACCC could be reviewed by the Australian Competition Tribunal. And in the meantime, it \"continues its preparations for the integration of Suncorp Bank into ANZ\". Meanwhile, Suncorp shares are now down 1.9 per cent after the news. Suncorp chair Christine McLoughlin says the bank is \"surprised and disappointed\" and would \"fully support\" ANZ if it referred the decision to the Australian Competition Tribunal. \"… we believe the Tribunal will accept the merits of our case,\" she said. Federal Treasurer Jim Chalmers has also noted the decision, saying the government \"respects the independence of the ACCC and does not intend to comment further on the decision or the future of the proposal\", but noted that there is the option for the banks to take the decision to the Tribunal or Federal Court.
