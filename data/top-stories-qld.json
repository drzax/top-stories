Professor Lyons says: \"The big four have enjoyed a compliant regulator … that has allowed the bastardisation of the partnership model.\" He said the big four accounting/consulting firms and their partners enjoyed a business model that was \"risk free, tax free and consequence free\". Professor Lyon pointed out that, as partnerships, the firms paid no company tax (partners and staff pay income tax on their earnings — at least in theory), no state payroll tax and are not required to publicly publish audited financial statements. But he said that, unlike other partnerships, there is a $10 million cap on liability for the accounting firms, which is then insured. \"The big four sit in every corporate boardroom across Australia but face no oversight,\" he said. Professor Lyon said he never saw a financial statement during his time as a partner at KPMG. He said that most partners do not fear potential financial or professional consequences from any misconduct.",
