Just confirming that is the logic here? - Tim. Hi Tim, You're one of a few keen commenters who have pointed this out. It sounds counterintuitive but you're right — that is exactly the logic here. RBA governor Philip Lowe told a Senate Estimates hearing in Canberra last month that higher interest rates will help alleviate some rental pressures in the short term because it would force people to \"economise\" on their housing — which translates to either living at home for longer, or getting housemates. Here's what he said: \"The way that this ends up fixing itself, unfortunately, is through higher housing prices and higher rents. \"Because as rents go up people decide not to move out of home, or you don't have that home office, you [get] a flatmate. \"The increase in supply can't happen immediately, but higher prices do lead people to economise on housing. \"That's the price mechanism at work. We need more people on average to live in each dwelling, and prices do that.\" Rents make up a solid chunk of the consumer price index (in fact, Mr Lowe says they're the \"single largest\" component) and expects rents will remain high for some time. Of course, long term we need to see an increase in housing supply — which Mr Lowe also acknowledged during Estimates. You can read the full story about Mr Lowe's justification for higher rents by my colleagues Gareth Hutchens and Rhiana Whitson below:",

I've put your question to our global affairs editor John Lyons who writes: Christa — intriguing question. I think the answer is it's hard to know. Because Putin is so hardline and ruthless, no-one has really wanted to show leadership qualities for fear that Putin might be threatened by them. People like Dmitry Medvedev have used the war to display their nationalist credentials, but hard to know. I think the various generals and oligarchs will be decisive in deciding who replaces Putin. Even now (because of the rebellion) I think behind the scenes there would be a lot of consideration of post-Putin scenarios, but most of this will be happening out of sight.",

I've put your question to global affairs editor John Lyons who says: Hello David — My view is that there is no chance that Ukraine would invade Russia. Ukraine's entire support from its international partners is predicated on defending itself from an illegal invasion. It's on that basis that various countries — many of the NATO countries, Australia and others — have provided support. For Ukraine to invade another country would mean it was doing the same thing that it was defending itself from and would lead to complete chaos in the region. I think if civil war breaks out in Russia, Ukraine will sit back and watch. Some Ukrainians may be relieved as it will mean that if the Russians are fighting internally then they will not be focused on attacking Ukraine.",
