It was the third fall in consumer confidence in a row with the confidence among the worst levels since the COVID-19 outbreak. Confidence fell in New South Wales and Victoria, but increased in Queensland, South Australia and Western Australia. ANZ says people are worried about high inflation and financial conditions. Confidence in current financial conditions fell by 5.7 points, while confidence that it was a good time to buy a major household item dropped by 0.8 per cent, after a 6.8 per cent fall in the previous week. ANZ senior economist Adelaide Timbrell says confidence among renters was at a record low, while it improved for those paying off their homes. \"The confidence level was among the five worst results since the COVID outbreak and has stayed below 80 for 20 straight weeks.\" \"The decline in the latest result was mainly driven by weaker confidence in âcurrent financial conditions\" \" Among the housing cohorts, confidence fell to a record low for those renting.\" \"It improved among those paying off their homes but remained below 70, while it fell for those who own their homes outright.\"",

He's used his final international appearance at a G20 finance meeting in India, alongside Treasurer Jim Chalmers, to warn about slowing productivity growth. Mr Lowe says falling productivity is a bigger challenge than inflation. \"The reality that most of us face is that productivity growth has slowed down in most of our economies,\" he said. \"It means lower sustainable growth in real wages, it means a limited increase in output as well. \"It means a slower expansion in the public services we want for our society and it means an increased tension in the distribution of income. \"So low productivity growth means economic and social problems. \"I agree the immediate consequence and the immediate challenge is to get inflation down. \"We really need to be successful there but I think the bigger challenge is to lift productivity growth.\" Mr Lowe ends his seven-year term as Reserve Bank governor in September after he was not reappointed by the treasurer. His deputy Michele Bullock will become the first women to lead the RBA. Here's more from ABC News.",
