She spoke to finance presenter Sue Lannin a short time ago, and says there there are signs the market is weakening. \"I would say the labour market does still look quite strong across the board, however we have seen some tick-up in the unemployment rate, the unemployment rate bottomed at at 3.4%, now it's at 3.7%,\" she said. \"The August figures are showing that underutilisation in the labour market, which is ultimately people who want to work more hours has ticked up as well a little bit. \"I think that there are definitely some signs of some weakening that's going to come in the workforce, not to mention all the leading indicators of jobs growth, things like labour hiring intentions and job vacancies, they've all come down quite significantly from levels last year. \"So the labour market is still going to show signs of slowing but it's taking a lot longer than most economists have been anticipating and what the RBA has been expecting as well .\"",
