Much stronger-than-expected jobs data out of the US on Friday (their time) saw hiring was up in September and slower wage growth. The Friday rally was also helped by strong gains in technology shares, with large cap tech names including Apple, Microsoft and Nvidia all jumping between 1.5% and 2.5%. At the close, the Dow Jones was up 0.9%, the S & P 500 picked up 1.2%, and the Nasdaq gained 1.6%. As for what it means for us here? We can expect a slightly higher start to the day, with futures up 0.8% to 7,037 points. Today will also bring a big focus on oil prices, in response to the developments in the Middle East over the weekend — it had increased by 0.6% to $US84.58 a barrel on Friday. Let's get into it and see where Monday takes us, shall we?",

On the ground in Israel, the military says it has now regained control of most infiltration points along the Gaza border that were breached during the attack. Israel says it has deployed thousands of soldiers to the southern region around Gaza and was evacuating citizens from the area. Of course the country's military has a lot of questions to answer in terms of how this attack could happen. From the southern town of Ofakim that was attacked by Hamas, Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said: \"The price the Gaza Strip will pay will be a very heavy one that will change reality for generations.\"",
