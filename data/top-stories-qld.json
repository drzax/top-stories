On Friday, they warned some market players not to hype up prices for the steelmaking ingredient in response to another price rally, and its state planner also pledged to step up its regulatory oversight of the market. China is the world's biggest producer of steel, and buys about two-thirds of global seaborne iron ore. \"Iron ore edged lower as Beijing targets market exuberance,\" ANZ commodity strategists said in a note. \"Regulators told futures companies in a recent meeting to not deliberately exaggerate the atmosphere of iron ore price rallies and to analyse the market objectively.\" China's iron ore imports in August climbed 13.8% from July, fuelled by growing demand from steel mills ramping up production ahead of peak construction months. Their excitement was also bolstered by Beijing's policy support for the domestic economy amid a stalling recovery. However, the outlook for iron ore demand beyond China's traditional September-October peak season is clouded by likely steel production cuts intended to curb carbon emissions. — with Reuters.",
