Earlier this morning, ASIC announced it was suing PayPal Australia over a contract term that gives small businesses just 60 days to dispute any fees they were charged, or they would be assumed to accept them. A spokesperson for PayPal Australia says the company is reviewing the allegations. \"We have been working in full cooperation with ASIC and take this matter very seriously,\" they said. \"It would not be appropriate to comment in detail on proceedings before the Court, however we are carefully reviewing the claims .\"",
