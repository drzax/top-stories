Wheatstone is one of the Chevron facilities affected by 24-hour workers strikes, along with its Gorgon site, with the strikes beginning over the weekend. The two LNG facilities account for over 5% of global supply, and the strikers were an escalation of what had been six days of brief work stoppages and limited bans on certain tasks. \"Chevron Australia confirms full production resumed last night (September 17) at the Wheatstone Gas Facility following a fault on September 14,\" a Chevron spokesperson said in a statement. \"During this time LNG continued to be produced at approximately 80% of usual rates, and vessel loading continued. \"There has been no change to scheduled LNG deliveries. Domestic gas facilities and supply were unaffected .\" Chevron has asked the Fair Work Commission to intervene in the ongoing dispute over wages and conditions in a bid to cancel the strikes. The commission will hold a hearing on Friday. The strikes were set to run until the end of this month but the Offshore Alliance union, a coalition of two unions, on Saturday flagged they intend to file a notice with Chevron to extend their work stoppage plans .",
