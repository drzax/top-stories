              "plaintext": "The Commonwealth Bank has updated its rate forecasts in light of yesterday's RBA decision to raise the cash rate to 4.1% and today's speech by Philip Lowe. CBA's head of Australian economics Gareth Aird said his team now expects one further cash rate rise to 4.35%, most likely at the August meeting, but with the possibility of it coming as soon as next month. He says there's a risk the RBA will make it four hikes in a row, with moves in July and August (to follow up on the rises in May and June) taking the cash rate to a possible peak of 4.6%. CBA has also pushed back the forecast timing of interest rate cuts, from the last quarter of this year to the first quarter of next, but tips 1.25 percentage points of reductions next year to take the cash rate target to 3.1 per cent by the end of 2024. Mr Aird also upped the odds of Australia sliding into recession, based on these latest forecasts. \"The Australian economy contracted on a per capita basis in Q1 23 [first quarter 2023] and we expect a per capita recession to be confirmed in the Q2 23 national accounts. \"A recession now looks a distinct possibility in H2 23 [second half 2023] and we put the chance at 50%.\"",

China's exports tumbled by 7.5 per cent from May last year amid weaker demand both at home and overseas. Imports contracted by an annual rate of 4.5 per cent, a slower pace of contraction, compared to the 7.9 per cent fall over the year to April. Official figures out last week showed China's manufacturing industry contracted for two months in a row. The latest numbers have spurred speculation of more stimulus spending by Chinese authorities. Iron ore prices rose in Singapore to $US107.80 a metric ton on the speculation. Beijing is also expected to further cut interest rates and the amount of reserves banks need to hold on their books to boost the economy. Chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management, Zhiwei Zhang, told Reuters that China needs to rely on domestic demand as the global economy slows. \"There is more pressure for the government to boost domestic consumption in the rest of the year, as global demand will likely weaken further in the second half.\"",
