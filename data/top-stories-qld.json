The US has vetoed a UN resolution to condemn all violence against civilians in the Israel-Gaza war and to urge humanitarian aid to Palestinians in Gaza, saying it was too early to craft an appropriate Security Council response to the crisis. US Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield says the council needs to allow current diplomatic efforts, including by US President Joe Biden, to unfold and to find out more facts on the ground first. She also criticised the measure for failing to underline Israel's right to self-defence. The resolution sponsored by Brazil has wide support and would have condemned all violence against civilians, including \"the heinous terrorists attacks by Hamas\" against Israel. The vote in the 15-member Security Council was 12 votes in favour and the US against, with Russia and Britain abstaining. Ms Thomas-Greenfield says Mr Biden was in the region engaging in diplomacy hoping to protect civilians, secure the release of hostages and prevent the conflict from spreading. \"We need to let that diplomacy play out,\" she says. She says the Security Council must speak out, but should be \"informed by facts on the ground and support direct diplomacy efforts that can save lives -- the council needs to get this right.\" The American ambassador criticised the resolution for not saying anything about Israel's right to self-defence following Hamas' October 7 attacks that killed more than 1,400 people in Israel.",
