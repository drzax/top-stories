                  "articleBody": "It's been a big week for bank profits, and the Commonwealth Bank is the last big bank to announce its results. CBA March quarter profit: $2.6 billion unaudited net profit, up from $2.3 billion last year $2.6 billion cash profit, up 10 per cent from December quarter Net interest income down 2 per cent because of mortgage market competition Expenses up 7 per cent because of higher compensation costs $223 million loan impairments Cash earnings were better than expected as higher home and business lending offset squeezed profit margins because of tough competition for loans. CBA says there were \"continued competitive pressure in home loan pricing and customers switching to higher yielding deposits.\" \"Competition for home loans has remained intense in Australia and New Zealand.\" Home lending rose $6.9 billion over the quarter, household deposits were up $6.2 billion, and business lending increased by $2.6 billion. But troubled and impaired assets rose to $6.7 billion, up from $6.3 billion at the end of 2023. The bank says home loan arrears remain low at 0.44 per cent (+0.01 per cent), but consumer finance arrears increased during the quarter with personal loan (+ 0.14 per cent) and credit card (+0.05 per cent) arrears rising. \"We expect to see further increases in arrears rates as the full effects of interest rate increases are borne by borrowers in the month's ahead,\" the bank said. CBA chief executive Matt Comyn says higher interest rates are hurting customers and he expects the economy to slow down. \"Many of our customers are feeling the strain of higher interest rates and the rising cost of living,\" he said. \"As higher interest rates impact the Australian economy in the period ahead, we expect economic growth to continue to moderate.\" \"Despite the challenging global economic outlook, Australia is relatively well positioned given the strength of our banking system, the economic tailwinds from a recovery in population growth, and relatively high commodity prices.\""

                  "headline": "PwC boss departs amid tax scandal",
                  "articleBody": "Hi team, Before we get lost in Budget chat, let's not let pass up big news from last night. Boss steps down Tom Seymour, the CEO of consulting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), stepped down last night in the middle of a growing scandal. Here's the summary of the mind-blowing scandal, backed up by emails published as part of a Senate inqury. What happened The government asked a PwC tax expert to help it write laws to better tax multinational companies. That expert - Peter-John Collins - used the secret knowledge to help PwC create a system for those companies to avoid paying the new taxes. The company used the scheme to make money and win new clients, and then gloated about it. Booted It came to light when former partner Peter-John Collins was banned by the Tax Practitioners Board disqualified him for a two year period because he \"did not act with integrity\" and \"failed to have in place adequate arrangements to manage conflicts of interest\". Multinational companies sometimes use a complex and expensive process of 'profit-shifting' to take money they've made in higher-taxing countries like Australia to countries like Singapore and The Netherlands where company tax rates are lower. The process is legal, but controversial. Boss gone too Mr Seymour has attempted to minimise the scope of the people involved in the scandal. New documents revealed more people - including him - were aware of the information. (Some may not have been aware of the way in which the information about the new laws came to be in their possession - through Peter-John Collins breaching confidentiality provisions). As of last night, Mr Seymour is no longer CEO. Here's some of the statement. After discussion with the PwC Australia Board of Partners, Tom Seymour is stepping down as CEO, effective immediately. We have appointed our Assurance Leader, Kristin Stubbins, to serve as acting CEO. In the coming months a new CEO will be elected by the Partners. We agreed with Tom that this is in the best interests of the firm and our stakeholders. Given the federal government is the biggest client of PwC and there's currently a Senate hearing into use of consultants by the public service the timing couldn't have been worse."

Wall Street was lacklustre overnight after Friday's stellar performance thanks to a fall in the US unemployment rate, and Apple's better than expected quarterly earnings. Disappointing company profit reports weighed on the market with drug manufacturer Catalent (-25.7 per cent) tanking after warning of a $US400 million cut to its annual revenue and profit forecasts. Meanwhile, Tyson Foods slumped (-16.4 per cent) after making a loss over the second quarter. The Dow Jones index fell 0.2 per cent, the S & P 500 was flat, while the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.2 per cent. And as Australian investors await tonight's federal budget, the ASX SPI 200 is down 0.1 per cent, indicating a slow start for the local share market. So join me today for all the markets news."

CBA March quarter profit: $2.6 billion unaudited net profit, up from $2.3 billion last year $2.6 billion cash profit, up 10 per cent from December quarter Net interest income down 2 per cent because of mortgage market competition Expenses up 7 per cent because of higher compensation costs $223 million loan impairments Cash earnings were better than expected as higher home and business lending offset squeezed profit margins because of tough competition for loans. CBA says there were \"continued competitive pressure in home loan pricing and customers switching to higher yielding deposits.\" \"Competition for home loans has remained intense in Australia and New Zealand.\" Home lending rose $6.9 billion over the quarter, household deposits were up $6.2 billion, and business lending increased by $2.6 billion. But troubled and impaired assets rose to $6.7 billion, up from $6.3 billion at the end of 2023. The bank says home loan arrears remain low at 0.44 per cent (+0.01 per cent), but consumer finance arrears increased during the quarter with personal loan (+ 0.14 per cent) and credit card (+0.05 per cent) arrears rising. \"We expect to see further increases in arrears rates as the full effects of interest rate increases are borne by borrowers in the month's ahead,\" the bank said. CBA chief executive Matt Comyn says higher interest rates are hurting customers and he expects the economy to slow down. \"Many of our customers are feeling the strain of higher interest rates and the rising cost of living,\" he said. \"As higher interest rates impact the Australian economy in the period ahead, we expect economic growth to continue to moderate.\" \"Despite the challenging global economic outlook, Australia is relatively well positioned given the strength of our banking system, the economic tailwinds from a recovery in population growth, and relatively high commodity prices.\"",

Boss steps down Tom Seymour, the CEO of consulting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), stepped down last night in the middle of a growing scandal. Here's the summary of the mind-blowing scandal, backed up by emails published as part of a Senate inqury. What happened The government asked a PwC tax expert to help it write laws to better tax multinational companies. That expert - Peter-John Collins - used the secret knowledge to help PwC create a system for those companies to avoid paying the new taxes. The company used the scheme to make money and win new clients, and then gloated about it. Booted It came to light when former partner Peter-John Collins was banned by the Tax Practitioners Board disqualified him for a two year period because he \"did not act with integrity\" and \"failed to have in place adequate arrangements to manage conflicts of interest\". Multinational companies sometimes use a complex and expensive process of 'profit-shifting' to take money they've made in higher-taxing countries like Australia to countries like Singapore and The Netherlands where company tax rates are lower. The process is legal, but controversial. Boss gone too Mr Seymour has attempted to minimise the scope of the people involved in the scandal. New documents revealed more people - including him - were aware of the information. (Some may not have been aware of the way in which the information about the new laws came to be in their possession - through Peter-John Collins breaching confidentiality provisions). As of last night, Mr Seymour is no longer CEO. Here's some of the statement. After discussion with the PwC Australia Board of Partners, Tom Seymour is stepping down as CEO, effective immediately. We have appointed our Assurance Leader, Kristin Stubbins, to serve as acting CEO. In the coming months a new CEO will be elected by the Partners. We agreed with Tom that this is in the best interests of the firm and our stakeholders. Given the federal government is the biggest client of PwC and there's currently a Senate hearing into use of consultants by the public service the timing couldn't have been worse.",

Wall Street was lacklustre overnight after Friday's stellar performance thanks to a fall in the US unemployment rate, and Apple's better than expected quarterly earnings. Disappointing company profit reports weighed on the market with drug manufacturer Catalent (-25.7 per cent) tanking after warning of a $US400 million cut to its annual revenue and profit forecasts. Meanwhile, Tyson Foods slumped (-16.4 per cent) after making a loss over the second quarter. The Dow Jones index fell 0.2 per cent, the S & P 500 was flat, while the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.2 per cent. And as Australian investors await tonight's federal budget, the ASX SPI 200 is down 0.1 per cent, indicating a slow start for the local share market. So join me today for all the markets news.",

CBA March quarter profit: $2.6 billion unaudited net profit, up from $2.3 billion last year $2.6 billion cash profit, up 10 per cent from December quarter Net interest income down 2 per cent because of mortgage market competition Expenses up 7 per cent because of higher compensation costs $223 million loan impairments Cash earnings were better than expected as higher home and business lending offset squeezed profit margins because of tough competition for loans. CBA says there were \"continued competitive pressure in home loan pricing and customers switching to higher yielding deposits.\" \"Competition for home loans has remained intense in Australia and New Zealand.\" Home lending rose $6.9 billion over the quarter, household deposits were up $6.2 billion, and business lending increased by $2.6 billion. But troubled and impaired assets rose to $6.7 billion, up from $6.3 billion at the end of 2023. The bank says home loan arrears remain low at 0.44 per cent (+0.01 per cent), but consumer finance arrears increased during the quarter with personal loan (+ 0.14 per cent) and credit card (+0.05 per cent) arrears rising. \"We expect to see further increases in arrears rates as the full effects of interest rate increases are borne by borrowers in the month's ahead,\" the bank said. CBA chief executive Matt Comyn says higher interest rates are hurting customers and he expects the economy to slow down. \"Many of our customers are feeling the strain of higher interest rates and the rising cost of living,\" he said. \"As higher interest rates impact the Australian economy in the period ahead, we expect economic growth to continue to moderate.\" \"Despite the challenging global economic outlook, Australia is relatively well positioned given the strength of our banking system, the economic tailwinds from a recovery in population growth, and relatively high commodity prices.\"",
