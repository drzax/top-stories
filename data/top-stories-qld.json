McDonald rose to prominence in rugby league in the 1960s after playing for the Manly Sea Eagles, captaining the side in their 1970 grand final loss to Souths. He played 13 Tests for Australia before becoming the Maroon's first coach, then spent 20 years as the chairman of the Queensland Rugby League. In a post on social media, his son Toowoomba Mayor Geoff McDonald paid tribute to the league great, saying his father was a remarkable individual who dedicated his life to making a positive impact on the lives of those around him. Mr McDonald said his father died peacefully yesterday afternoon. QRL chairman Bruce Hatcher said McDonald was “quite simply a remarkable individual who touched the lives of so many people around him.”",

The US-born 34-year-old was sentenced to three years in prison in 2021 after pleading guilty to helping Guzman's Sinaloa drug cartel, including conspiracy to launder money and distribute illegal drugs and engaging in financial dealings. The Federal Bureau of Prisons confirmed she had been r eleased on Wednesday (local time) from a low-security confinement institution in Los Angeles, but did not give further information, citing privacy, safety and security reasons. Coronel has two daughters with Guzman, whom she met when she was a young beauty queen and married in 2007 at age 18. Guzman is meanwhile serving a life sentence in the US after being extradited there in 2017 following two escapes from Mexican maximum-security prisons. Reuters",

              "plaintext": "French regulators ordered Apple to stop selling the iPhone 12, saying it emits electromagnetic radiation levels that are above European Union standards for exposure. Apple disputed the findings and said the device complies with regulations. The French government agency that manages wireless communications frequencies issued the order after the iPhone 12 recently failed one of two types of tests for electromagnetic waves capable of being absorbed by the body. It's unclear why the phone, which was released in late 2020, didn't pass the agency's latest round of tests and why it was only that particular model. France's digital minister said the iPhone 12's radiation levels are still much lower than levels that scientific studies consider could harm users, and the agency itself acknowledges that its tests don't reflect typical phone use. The agency recently tested 141 cellphones and found that when the iPhone 12 is held in a hand or carried in a pocket, its level of electromagnetic energy absorption is 5.74 watts per kilogram, higher than the EU standard of 4 watts per kilogram.
