It was all resolved a few weeks ago by Fair Work Commission, but then it wasn't again. The two sides are still talking and will meet again tomorrow. Workers are threatening to resume strikes from next week at Chevron's Gorgon and Wheatstone facilities in norther Western Australia. The two sites supply about 6 per cent of the world's LNG. Since the Fair Work decision, unions have now accused Chevron of reneging on certain commitments. On Monday unions said they would restart strikes on October 19. Chevron said on Monday the disagreements only concern a few issues, including reimbursement for travel and meals and it is committed to reaching a deal. Watch this space.",

A brief backgrounder for you (but it's worth clicking the link below for more). About a decade ago, the federal government asked PwC's international tax expert Peter-John Collins to help them design laws that would solve a problem: getting big overseas companies like Google, Facebook and Apple to pay their fair share of tax in Australia. Just before the federal budget in May this year, news broke that PwC had used its insider access and knowledge (from being a consultant to the federals government) about multinational corporate tax to help its business customers dodge paying some of that tax. Heads rolled. The company's Australian CEO quit, nine senior partners were stood down, and the man at the centre of the scandal was investigated by the Australian Federal Police. Being consultants for the federal government is big business for PwC — it has been awarded more than $537 million in Commonwealth contracts (read: your and my tax dollars) in the past two years alone, and that makes up about 20 per cent of its annual revenue. Labor senator Deborah O'Neill cracked it all open. Ms O'Neill summed it up using parliamentary privilege, saying Mr Collins and Mr Seymour had been involved in: \"The deception of the Australian parliament, the Australian people, and a betrayal of the ethical and professional standards they should be upholding. \"This is a major cancer on the way that information that is vital to the national interest is being undertaken by those at PwC.\" She is of course one of the Senators grilling PwC and others today.",
