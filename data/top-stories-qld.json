Mr Lowe replied by saying although they could provide short-term solutions to the problem, it would ultimately make the problem of a lack of affordable rentals worse. Here's his full response to that question: \"When housing prices were rising quickly, people were saying, 'Well, we need to give people more money to help with them,' and when rents are rising quickly, 'We need to kind of cap the rent increases.' \" They're short-term fixes that both of them, in my judgment, make the problem worse. \"So what I would like to see is a longer-term focus on this because the short-term solutions, or the short-term responses, are not solutions, and generally giving people more money or capping prices doesn't help with the balance of supply and demand in the market. \" In most cases, rent controls reduce incentive to add to supply, so it might help in the short run, it might relieve some pressure on people in the short run, and clearly that's the case, but we've got to keep the medium-term perspective on this. \"Will that add to the supply of rental accommodation over time? My judgment would be that it would not and could actually reduce it. \"It might help in the short run but create problems in the long run.\"",

The number of dwellings in the country has increased by 1.5 per cent, so there's a big gap there, and when demand is strong and supply's weak, prices go up. \"There's always a tendency to try and come up with short-term solutions, [but] there aren't short-term solutions here. \"The solution has to be putting in place a structure that makes the supply side of the housing market more flexible, and that means zoning and planning deregulation and it means state and local governments being part of the solution.\" You can watch his full response below:",

I've been involved in the interest rate setting process for a number of decades, and no politician has indirectly or directly put pressure on the bank during that period. \"It's one of the very positive things about Australia — is that the political class do not put pressure on the central bank. And we take our decisions completely independently of the political noise. \" I know what we do often is unpopular, and sometimes what I say is unpopular, but that hasn't diminished our resolve to do the right thing. \"I hope Australians understand that.\" He continued discussing how being unpopular often comes with the territory of working at the RBA: \"The reason that monetary policy has really been assigned to an independent central bank is it's very difficult for the political class to do what we're currently doing, that is putting up interest rates [and having] people hurting. \"It's very uncomfortable, and we're putting up interest rates — that is incredibly unpopular. \" I often read in the paper that I'm the most unpopular person in the country.
