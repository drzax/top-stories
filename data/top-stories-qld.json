Speaking to RN Breakfast a little while ago, he said the latest ABS data showing unemployment was at 3.5% was a \"good kind of surprise\". \"I think the fact that our jobs market has been really quite remarkably strong, I think has been a good kind of surprise,\" he told host Patricia Karvelas. \"It's broadly consistent with what we expected in the budget, maybe a little bit stronger than most people anticipated. \"But when you consider what's coming at us from around the world, it really is quite a remarkable thing, that we've got unemployment at 3.5%. \"And under the life of this government, the first 13 months of this government, something like half a million new jobs have been created, so that's a real source of strength. \"Our jobs market is really holding up despite the economy slowing considerably elsewhere.\" Karvelas then followed up by asking if it would put pressure on the RBA to raise rates again next month, but Chalmers said it would depend on a range of economic factors. \"They'll [the RBA] weigh up a whole range of factors that weigh up global uncertainty,\" he replied. \"Some of the other data has been a bit softer, the national accounts for March were certainly relatively flat, and so they'll have the opportunity to consider the jobs market but also in the context of all of these other indicators that show that our economy is slowing. \"But our labor market that jobs market is holding up really well.\"",

Senator Pocock is on the committee investigating the consulting giants, with the sector facing a number of scandals, including PwC's tax leak fiasco. EY and Deloitte faced questioning at the Senate committee this week, but Senator Pocock told News Breakfast they were not forthcoming with information. \"It felt like trying to get blood from a stone, to be honest,\" she said. \"We had given a lot of notice to some of these big companies that are partnerships about their appearance, EY and Deloitte. \"We asked them to tell us about their partnership arrangements, their rule book, the way they run, and deal with a number of matters that have been raised publicly through questions on notice, and we're left wanting. \" We really need to know much more about the way in which these organisations pursue their consultancy incomes and we also heard a lot from two very significant people who've spent years inside these companies talking about the culture, the culture that arises from a business model that goes hard after money and makes that the primary reason for existence and that really affects the way in which people live the culture inside the organisation, very pressured. \"And it means that ethics are often the casualty of the pursuit of the contract.\" You can watch Senator Pocock's full interview below:",

That's despite the firm's second quarter distributable earnings (or what it can pay to shareholders in dividends) dropping by 39% because of a slump in asset sales. Its distributable earnings fell to $US1.2 billion from nearly $US2 billion last year. As for how big that asset sale slump has been? Blackstone's net profit from asset sales fell by 82%, down to $US388.4 million from $US2.2 billion a year ago — and that's because of high interest rates, sticky inflation, and broader economic uncertainty. Blackstone had originally planned to reach the $1 trillion milestone by 2026, meaning they've hit their goal three years ahead of schedule. It's also well ahead of its biggest rival, Brookfield Asset Management, which has $US825 billion in assets.",
