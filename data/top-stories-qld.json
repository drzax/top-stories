But before then, Ms Bullock will give her first speech since being appointed as the first female governor in the central bank's history tonight. She'll be giving a speech titled \"Climate Change and Central Banks\" at the Australian National University in Canberra, which is set to begin at 5:40pm AEST. Ms Bullock will also be taking questions after her speech, where it's expected she'll share some insights about how the RBA sees interest rates affecting the economy, what its forecasts are for inflation, and what they might do at next Tuesday's meeting. We'll bring you Ms Bullock's speech and the Q & A later on in the day, in a special Live Moment. If you're unsure what that is — open (or download!) the ABC News app on your phone or tablet, head to your settings, tap on \"Notifications\" and scroll down to ensure you're signed up for \"Live\" category. Once that's done, wait until we get closer to 5:40pm AEST and keep an eye on your device — all will be revealed then!",

Qantas has set the end of the year as the deadline for when outstanding flight credits — totalling at least $470 million — need to be claimed. Of that amount, $370 million is owed to Australian Qantas customers, and $100 million is owed to Jetstar customers. Yesterday Qantas executives Alan Joyce, Steph Tully and Andrew McGiness could not say the value of flight credits owed to overseas customers, but it was less than $100 million. Qantas said its goal is to have \"zero\" flight credits remaining by December 31. Speaking in Perth, Mr Albanese said customers should be given a choice to get a refund or credit on products they buy, but don't use. \"They [Qantas] need to look after their customers ... and there is no question that that needs to occur when people have made bookings in good faith,\" he said.",
