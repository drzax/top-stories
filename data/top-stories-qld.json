Mr Mayo says despite the polls pointing to a no vote, he hasn't lost hope. \"I am optimistic. It is a different feeling on the ground. I have been leafleting and train stations and I have been door knocking and phone banking for a long time,\" he said speaking on ABC News Breakfast. \"There is a different story out there and I hope that comes to a happy conclusion, where we recognise Indigenous people as we should have done long ago and we enshrine the ability for us to be heard,\" he says. \"That is the key to closing the gap in life expectancy which in remote communities is something like 20 years difference, broadly it is around eight years, but we need to do better and I think that a yes vote gives us that opportunity. A no vote is just more of the same.\" When asked how how many Australians are undecided and will potentially make their decisions at the polling booths, Mr Mayo says: \"it is around 30 per cent and that is matched by our experience on the doors and in the phone banking. \"These final conversations in these last eight days are going to be vital.\" Mr Mayo says SA and Tasmania are swing states to focus on but it is important to think about all Australians. \"As a campaign, we have made sure that we are spreading the word about what a hopeful and important step this will be for our nation. We are hoping that we can get six out of six.\"",

Original released a song titled Yes, delivering an impassioned endorsement of a Yes vote in the referendum on an Indigenous Voice to Parliament. The track featuring Indigenous rapper Briggs, has gone off with over 4 million hits already. \"I think that it speaks to that generation,\" says Briggs on the popularity of the song. \"I reckon this is how people are talking in the pubs and in the lounge rooms.\" An impressive line-up of artists including Paul Kelly, Jimmy Barnes and Hilltop Hoods will be performing at Shepparton today, hoping to inform more people about the Voice referendum. Organised by Briggs, the day-long Yes concert is aimed at undecided voters. \"Over the last few weeks, I was just wanting to put more positive stuff into the sphere, because it was like, so much vitriol and so negative,\" Briggs tells ABC News Breakfast. \"And I think that the best way that we can show people what a Yes might look like is by putting a show together with artists that share the same kind of vision for unity and solidarity.\" Victoria has been inundated with heavy rains this week but the rapper and activist is hopeful the rain will hold off today. Can't make it to the gig? Luckily, there's a First and Forever Special streaming now on iview, showcasing live music highlights from Baker Boy, Briggs & many more.",
