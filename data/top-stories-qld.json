I’ve been here watching the war inside Gaza. It means we’ve been able to see the evidence of Israeli’s constant bombardment into the north – building after building that is damaged or completely destroyed. The whole area looks like a big grey pile of ash, because any of the buildings that are left standing are covered in concrete dust. It’s actually pretty eerie to look at. Almost every few seconds, we hear the battle unfolding on the ground. War planes fly overhead and then we hear a huge explosion – we see a massive plume of smoke rise into the sky. Another airstrike. Suddenly there are several loud bangs close by. Israeli tanks stationed near the Gaza border are firing from the ground into the Strip. I see several bright flashes of light, as artillery is fired. I can hear machine guns as Hamas militants are locked in gun battle with Israeli troops on the ground. It sounds like it’s coming from the north but we can’t be sure because the Israeli military isn’t really telling us a lot of information of what’s happening on the ground.",

The bank is also raising the international transaction fee on select credit cards from December 1, 2023. From today, the interest rate on eight of CBA's credit cards will rise to 20.99 per cent. These changes follow CBA's increase to the purchase rate on its Low Rate card on August 25, where the rate was hiked 0.75 percentage points to 13.99 per cent. This rate has not been changed today. \"The last thing customers carrying around credit card debt need is a higher interest rate,\" RateCity research director Sally Tindall said. \"If you're someone who can't clear their credit card bill every single month, you should not be holding a card with a rate that's over 15 per cent — even 10 per cent is too high. \" There are 14 cards on the market offering rates under 10 per cent, along with five cards that charge fees instead of interest. \"At 3.50 per cent, CBA now has one of the highest international transaction fees in the market, but only on select cards.\"",
