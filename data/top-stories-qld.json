Omri's father Dani said his son was inside a house with his wife and two daughters, six-month-old Roni and two-year-old Alma, when Hamas gunmen took him captive. \"They said, 'either you come with us, or we'll kill both the families',\" Dani told ABC News. \"When [his daughter] saw they took her father she screamed, 'my father, my father', and his wife said to him, 'Omri, I love you, don't be a hero'. \"Then they took him.\" Omri Miran has been held hostage for more than two weeks in Gaza. Some of the captured are hidden within a labyrinth of Hamas-constructed tunnels that run under several areas of Gaza. In 2021, Hamas claimed it had about 500 kilometres of the tunnels in Gaza, all together. Omri Milan’s family don't know where he is being held, and whether he is injured, but believe he is alive. \"In the first week, I didn't stop crying a fountain of tears, and then in the second week my tears have dried up and my heart still hurts. But my heart is in Gaza,\" Dani said. \"My grandchild, she is two years old and she has had to grow up a lot in the last two weeks,\" Dani said. \"She cries out for her father.\" He said he supported all Israeli military action to get his son back with his family. \"I'm happy that my son is not in a coffin, and I've got hope that he will come back in one piece, healthy, exactly like they took him,\" he said.",
