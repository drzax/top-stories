              "plaintext": "The West Australian government has announced it will overturn new Aboriginal cultural heritage laws, which were passed in 2021 after the destruction of sacred caves at Juukan Gorge in the Pilbara. The government will restore the original act from 1972 with \"targeted, simple amendments\" after an outcry from property owners over the new legislation. Under the new planned amendments, traditional owners will be able to appeal against development decisions under Section 18 of the 1972 act. Traditional owners were prohibited from appealing or talking publicly about Rio Tinto's plans to blow up the 46,000-year-old caves in 2020 under the old legislation. WA Premier Roger Cook says the new laws were too complicated and placed unnecessary burdens on property owners. \"Today's announcement is about listening to the people of WA. \"It' s about carefully considering the circumstances in front of us. \"The Juukan Gorge tragedy was a global embarrassment for Australia, something needed to be done. \"No-one can argue with that. \"But our legislative response was wrong.\" Mr Cook rejected speculation that the WA government is repealing the laws to help get the referendum on the Indigenous Voice to Parliament passed. \"I have not had any communication with the prime minister or any federal members in relation to these laws. \"The only contact I have had with the federal government in relation to these laws is when I contacted the prime minister yesterday to announce that we would be going in this direction.\" The Juukan Gorge traditional owners, the Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura Aboriginal Corporation, say they feel betrayed by the plans to repeal the new legislation. PKKP corporation chairman Terry Drage: \"The previous heritage act, which predates Native Title, permitted the wanton destruction of  Juukan Gorge,\" he says. \"While the new act is not perfect, it is better than what it replaced. “If the state government had listened to community feedback during the consultation phase, we  would not be in this mess.\" The PKKP has called on the federal government to proceed with national cultural heritage laws, as recommended by the parliamentary inquiry into the destruction of the Juukan Gorge caves. Mr Cook has ruled out \"revisiting\" new cultural heritage laws. Here's more from my colleague Keane Bourke in Perth.",
