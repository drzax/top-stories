Stephanie Chalmers here to take you through the day, and it's looking set to be a pretty positive start to the session with futures pointing higher. It follows some decent gains on Wall Street, particularly for tech stocks. Amazon rose 2.5%, while Netflix ended up 2.4%. Electric carmaker Tesla also did well, rising 4.6%. The US dollar came under some pressure as oil prices slumped, and some data on weekly jobless claims was worse than expected, which helped the Aussie dollar above 67 US cents. In Europe, markets were mostly higher but eurozone economic growth was revised lower for the first quarter, down 0.1 per cent. And since that's the second quarter of economic contraction in a row, that means a 'technical recession'. It's been a pretty massive week, with the Reserve Bank raising rates for a 12th time and Australia's economic growth slowing, so stick with us, ahead of what's a long weekend in some states (the ASX will be closed on Monday).",
