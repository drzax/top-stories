The video was posted on Hamas' Telegram channel and shows a young woman with a bandaged arm speaking Hebrew. She says her name is Mia Schem, she is 21 years old and from Shoham, near Tel Aviv. In the video she asks to be returned to her family as quickly as possible. A representative of the family, which was among a group of French families that appealed last week to President Emmanuel Macron to help free their missing relatives, confirmed her identity to Reuters. The Israel Defense Forces reacted to the video and said that Schem's family was notified of her abduction last week and that they are in continuous contact with them at this time. \"In the video, Hamas is trying to portray itself as a humane organization, while it is a responsible for the murder and abduction of babies, women, children, and elderly,\" the IDF statement said.

Antony Blinken has been in discussions with Israeli leaders, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. He says the US and Israel \"have agreed to develop a plan that will enable humanitarian aid from donor nations and multilateral organisations to reach civilians in Gaza\". \"It is critical that aid begin flowing into Gaza as soon as possible,\" Mr Blinken says. \"We share Israel's concern that Hamas may seize or destroy aid entering Gaza or otherwise prevent it from reaching the people who need it. \"If Hamas in any way blocks humanitarian assistance from reaching civilians including by seizing the aid itself, we'll be the first to come to condemn it and work to prevent it from happening again. \"The President very much looks forward to discussing it further when he's here on Wednesday.\" Other talking points flagged by Mr Blinken include the US reaffirming its commitment \"that Israel has the right to defend its people from Hamas\". He says Mr Biden will send a \"crystal clear message\" that no other nation should \"take advantage of this crisis to attack Israel\". \"To that end, [Mr Biden] has deployed two aircraft carrier groups and other military assets to the region,\" Mr Blinken says. The release of hostages and a \"comprehensive brief on Israel's war aims and strategy\" are also on the agenda. White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby says Mr Biden will travel to Jordan after his trip to Israel to meet with King Abdullah, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas.",

But that's exactly what happened as he explained to News Radio's Tom Oriti how he has 25 seconds to get to safety if he hears air sirens go off near where he is reporting from in Ashdod, southern Israel. The explosion can be heard at about 1:30 in the video. \"While we're talking … I can see a missile, I think it's an Iron Dome missile going up to hit a probably incoming Hamas missile from the Gaza Strip,\" he said. \"In fact I just heard a bang go off…. so we've had a fairly heavy day even here in Ashdod.\" Lyons then went on to explain how he raced to safety in a stairwell after sirens went off the previous night and how he found himself in a stairwell with four Israel soldiers dressed in their underwear. On hearing another massive big bang, Lyons told Oriti he believed that was the sound of missiles exploding. \"Did you hear that?\" I'm not sure what that is actually…the bang we just heard must have been the one I just heard hitting the missile coming in from Gaza. What that does is it explodes the incoming missile so in fact the two missiles are exploding.. but that shook things a bit… that was a pretty confronting sound.\"",

              "plaintext": "Rabobank has released its 2023/24 Australian Winter Crop Forecast, showing Australian grain and oilseed production is set to return to more modest totals for the current season as drier growing conditions \"hit home\". It says Australia is on track to harvest a total winter crop of 48.72 million tonnes for the current season. While down 24 per cent on last season’s record-breaking 63.85 million tonne national crop, this is still close to the five-year average and above totals recorded in 2018/19 and 2020/21. And prices are expected to provide some silver lining to the lower production totals for Australian farmers, says report co-author, RaboResearch associate analyst Edward McGeoch, with dry conditions in Australia pushing local prices above those globally, to a \"positive basis\" for wheat and also barley. While global export demand should also be supportive of canola prices. Mr McGeoch says drier weather conditions that have spread across many cropping regions in the country and the prevailing El Nino climate outlook are playing a significant role in the tighter supply outlook for Australian grain and oilseeds. “Production expectations are varied across regions with some farmers expecting to see elevated production due to positive growing conditions they have experienced while others will be facing tough decisions as to whether it will be worth harvesting their crop,” he said. The bank says all cereal and coarse grain production – including wheat, barley and oats – is expected to decrease this season, with wheat declining the furthest, down to 26.9 million tonnes. Winter crop production is expected to decline across all states, except Victoria, where the bank sees it rising by eight per cent from last year.",
