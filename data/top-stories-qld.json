But here's national technology reporter, Danny Tran: Artificial intelligence is getting a boost, with the federal government tipping in $101.2 million over the next five years to help businesses integrate AI and quantum technologies. That includes expanding the National AI Centre and its role in making sure the technology is responsible (I, Robot, anyone?) as well as setting up the Australian Centre for Quantum Growth. Misha Schubert from Science and Technology Australia says this type of investment is important: \"Every time anyone enters a prompt or an instruction into ChatGPT or a generative AI tool, it is hoovering that up and building a complex profile about us. \"So [it is] really important that we diligently deepen our investments in ethical and responsible use of AI and the sort of safeguards around privacy and copyright and security on generative AI tools.\" Simon Bush from the Australian Information Industry Association, the peak body for the information and communications technology sector, says we have a \"very limited\" opportunity to get this technology right. \"We are competing with our trading partners, both friendly and not so friendly, in relation to areas like AI and Quantum,\" he says. \"This funding enables smaller Australian innovative companies to access government support, to commercialise their IP and their technology, to really bring that to the market and also [retain] really smart people, so [we] don't lose them overseas. \"It’s a really good down payment on securing Australia’s future.\""

She says while the budget includes some positive investments to tackle the cost-of-living, the increase to the Jobseeker payment will do little to lift vulnerable people out of poverty. Julie: We know that many aspects of the cost of living are at near record highs, including rental prices, petrol, groceries and other essentials, which makes it even less sustainable for a Jobseeker recipient to live a dignified life. We saw during the pandemic that increased payments reduced measures of poverty and housing stress, but a very modest increase of $2.80 per day will sadly make little difference to many. Our political leaders must create a fair social safety net that ensures all Jobseeker recipients can afford an adequate standard of living."

                  "articleBody": "Reporting by Thomas Oriti, Anna Pykett and Wing Kuang Nationals leader David Littleproud has slammed the federal government for introducing a new fresh food tax for farmers to cover biosecurity costs. The federal budget announced a 10 per cent increase in agricultural levies to fund biosecurity activities and organisations, expecting it to raise $153 million over three years. Littleproud told ABC NewsRadio that this is an \"outrageous move\". \"They are going to tax farmers to pay for the biosecurity costs of their competitors to import product into this country, and that has to be passed on to the consumer,\" he said, adding this would not help address food price inflation. He also says regional Australians will have few benefits from Labor's cost-of-living package, stressing what's needed in regional Australia is infrastructure and new childcare places. He was also concerned that new Medicare boosts would lead to the closure of regional pharmacies, meaning regional Australians may face more accessibility issues in the future. \"We feel like the forgotten Australians,\" he said."

The budget offers a $14.6 billion cost of living package, including a $40 per fortnight increase to JobSeeker, which the Liberal Party hasn't yet taken a position on. \"Critically, in the new initiatives that Labor has brought forward there's $2 of extra spending for every $1 of revenue. And this is the critical point: that's inflationary,\" he told RN this morning. \"What we needed was a budget that was going to take pressure off inflation, in the process then take pressure off interest rates, and of course that helps everybody. \"That's why the right budget to unite Australians, to help all Australians was a budget that was going to take those pressures away.\" You can listen to the Shadow Treasurer's full interview on Radio National with Patricia Karvelas here."

                  "articleBody": "By Jemima Burt Queensland's peak social service body says the federal government needs to do more to meet the demand for housing in Queensland. This year's budget includes a significant investment in more social housing around the country, an increase to rent assistance, and concessions for build to rent projects. But Aimee McVeigh from the Queensland Council of Social Service said research shows a significant number of Queenslanders are missing out on access to affordable housing. \"Our research shows that we have 300,000 Queenslanders with unmet housing needs … If we can see that federally the government is committing to 20,000 social houses across the country it is clear that the current plan bears no relationship to the need,\" she said. She said despite modest rises to welfare payments, there are many Queenslanders who will continue to live in poverty. \"There is in this federal budget an increase of less than $3 a day for that payment. \"Clearly it isn't enough to go anywhere near lifting those almost half a million Queenslanders out of poverty,\" Ms McVeigh said."

That includes an increase to the JobSeeker rate by $40 a fortnight and the government’s energy bill relief plan. Victorian Council of Social Service CEO Emma King said there were positive moves in the budget to help vulnerable people. “There's critical support in there for single parents, people on low incomes who need health care, and it kicked off really important investment to retrofit low-income homes to improve energy efficiency,” she said. However, Ms King had one eye on the upcoming state budget, which Premier Daniel Andrews has repeatedly warned will be “tough”. “We've got a real challenge on our hands in terms of what we've got to look forward to in looking at the Victorian budget and where those cuts might be,” she said."

McKenzie: This is a missed opportunity to permanently lower people’s power bills. To meet the climate challenge head on, Australia needs to urgently unlock the most affordable energy source available, renewables. Sure, this Budget provides renewables assistance to 170,000 households. But when you consider the critical challenge of electrifying everything with renewable power, backed with storage, for 10.8 million households, that barely gets us off the starting blocks. The Labor Government has demonstrated in this Budget that they want to support Australians who are struggling. Climate change makes every Australian vulnerable, so the scale of investment on climate action needs to match the task ahead of us."

Well, it's not on a par with the $1.4 billion allocated to NSW infrastructure projects in the Labor government's first budget last October or the $3.3 billion in the Coalition's pre-election budget in March last year. This time around, NSW will get $362 million over eight years, including for safety upgrades on the Bells Line of Road and Nowra Bypass planning. There's also $3 million to look at the feasibility of an intermodal terminal in Forbes, as part of the Inland Rail program. The government has said the $120 billion in the pipeline of the Infrastructure Investment Program will be reviewed, working with the states and territories to determine priorities."

Have heard nothing on this since 21 May. Presumably it's an inflationary measure, but still a game changer for those lagging behind the housing market  - Josh. Hi Josh! Thanks for writing in. I've passed on your question to political reporter Jake Evans who says: The Help to Buy scheme was funded in the treasurer's first budget in October last year. The federal government committed in that budget to $324.6 million over four years to establish the scheme to help people on low to moderate incomes to purchase a new or existing home with an equity contribution from the government. The treasurer said in his budget speech last year that the scheme would assist up to 40,000 people."

They don't come in for more than a year now. They haven't actually been a focus of the deliberations for this budget at all.\""

She aded there was another missed opportunity to tackle the structural deficit. \"Business did all the heavy lifting last night and there is nothing to drive our investment against the backdrop of other countries who are pushing hard into this. \"The hard work is fixing and reforming government services. By that, not cost cutting but going to digital services, getting improved outcomes for people, making sure we slow the rate of growth in these services, that they are efficient and effective for people and fix all of the issues in our federation.\""

But here's national technology reporter, Danny Tran: Artificial intelligence is getting a boost, with the federal government tipping in $101.2 million over the next five years to help businesses integrate AI and quantum technologies. That includes expanding the National AI Centre and its role in making sure the technology is responsible (I, Robot, anyone?) as well as setting up the Australian Centre for Quantum Growth. Misha Schubert from Science and Technology Australia says this type of investment is important: \"Every time anyone enters a prompt or an instruction into ChatGPT or a generative AI tool, it is hoovering that up and building a complex profile about us. \"So [it is] really important that we diligently deepen our investments in ethical and responsible use of AI and the sort of safeguards around privacy and copyright and security on generative AI tools.\" Simon Bush from the Australian Information Industry Association, the peak body for the information and communications technology sector, says we have a \"very limited\" opportunity to get this technology right. \"We are competing with our trading partners, both friendly and not so friendly, in relation to areas like AI and Quantum,\" he says. \"This funding enables smaller Australian innovative companies to access government support, to commercialise their IP and their technology, to really bring that to the market and also [retain] really smart people, so [we] don't lose them overseas. \"It’s a really good down payment on securing Australia’s future.\"",

She says while the budget includes some positive investments to tackle the cost-of-living, the increase to the Jobseeker payment will do little to lift vulnerable people out of poverty. Julie: We know that many aspects of the cost of living are at near record highs, including rental prices, petrol, groceries and other essentials, which makes it even less sustainable for a Jobseeker recipient to live a dignified life. We saw during the pandemic that increased payments reduced measures of poverty and housing stress, but a very modest increase of $2.80 per day will sadly make little difference to many. Our political leaders must create a fair social safety net that ensures all Jobseeker recipients can afford an adequate standard of living.",

The federal budget announced a 10 per cent increase in agricultural levies to fund biosecurity activities and organisations, expecting it to raise $153 million over three years. Littleproud told ABC NewsRadio that this is an \"outrageous move\". \"They are going to tax farmers to pay for the biosecurity costs of their competitors to import product into this country, and that has to be passed on to the consumer,\" he said, adding this would not help address food price inflation. He also says regional Australians will have few benefits from Labor's cost-of-living package, stressing what's needed in regional Australia is infrastructure and new childcare places. He was also concerned that new Medicare boosts would lead to the closure of regional pharmacies, meaning regional Australians may face more accessibility issues in the future. \"We feel like the forgotten Australians,\" he said.",

This year's budget includes a significant investment in more social housing around the country, an increase to rent assistance, and concessions for build to rent projects. But Aimee McVeigh from the Queensland Council of Social Service said research shows a significant number of Queenslanders are missing out on access to affordable housing. \"Our research shows that we have 300,000 Queenslanders with unmet housing needs … If we can see that federally the government is committing to 20,000 social houses across the country it is clear that the current plan bears no relationship to the need,\" she said. She said despite modest rises to welfare payments, there are many Queenslanders who will continue to live in poverty. \"There is in this federal budget an increase of less than $3 a day for that payment. \"Clearly it isn't enough to go anywhere near lifting those almost half a million Queenslanders out of poverty,\" Ms McVeigh said.",

That includes an increase to the JobSeeker rate by $40 a fortnight and the government’s energy bill relief plan. Victorian Council of Social Service CEO Emma King said there were positive moves in the budget to help vulnerable people. “There's critical support in there for single parents, people on low incomes who need health care, and it kicked off really important investment to retrofit low-income homes to improve energy efficiency,” she said. However, Ms King had one eye on the upcoming state budget, which Premier Daniel Andrews has repeatedly warned will be “tough”. “We've got a real challenge on our hands in terms of what we've got to look forward to in looking at the Victorian budget and where those cuts might be,” she said.",

Well, it's not on a par with the $1.4 billion allocated to NSW infrastructure projects in the Labor government's first budget last October or the $3.3 billion in the Coalition's pre-election budget in March last year. This time around, NSW will get $362 million over eight years, including for safety upgrades on the Bells Line of Road and Nowra Bypass planning. There's also $3 million to look at the feasibility of an intermodal terminal in Forbes, as part of the Inland Rail program. The government has said the $120 billion in the pipeline of the Infrastructure Investment Program will be reviewed, working with the states and territories to determine priorities.",

I've passed on your question to political reporter Jake Evans who says: The Help to Buy scheme was funded in the treasurer's first budget in October last year. The federal government committed in that budget to $324.6 million over four years to establish the scheme to help people on low to moderate incomes to purchase a new or existing home with an equity contribution from the government. The treasurer said in his budget speech last year that the scheme would assist up to 40,000 people.",

Treasurer Jim Chalmers says \"it's a really important change.\" \"One of the most concerning parts of the community of Australians who can't find works is over-55s and particularly women over 55 ,\" he told News Breakfast. \"The advice that we receive from the expert committees we set up is that this is a big and growing challenge for us. It is harder and harder, particularly for women over 55, to get back into work. Big increases in homelessness and the like and we've tried to provide extra help there.\"",

                  "articleBody": "As a person, your credit rating is a summary of whether you're a 'good risk'. If you're not - say you've been late with paying your bills or defaulted on a mortgage - you're pay a higher interest rates on loans to take account of the fact you're more risky (for the lender) than other people. For nation's it's similar. Ratings agencies work out if you, a company or a nation are a 'good risk'. New comments from Fitch Ratings in the wake of the 2023 Australian federal budget are broadly supportive \"The return to a underlying cash surplus in the current fiscal year and clear improvement in the federal government's fiscal position over the budget's forecast horizon is supportive of Australia's 'AAA' sovereign rating,\" said Jeremy Zook, director, sovereigns, APAC at Fitch Ratings. \"Fiscal outcomes are stronger than what we expected when we last affirmed Australia's rating with a Stable outlook in December 2022.\" It also says the budget won't boost inflation. \"The government's decision to allow higher than expected revenue collection to flow through to improved budget outcomes by keeping spending relatively contained, points to a commitment to its fiscal strategy and is not likely to contribute to inflationary pressures in the economy. We think the budget assumptions are reasonable and commodity price assumptions remain modest compared to our forecasts. Still, downside risks persist given the weak global outlook, elevated inflation and high interest rates Mr Zook does see \"structural budget pressures\" over the medium-term and warns that risks to the rating could build with spending demands \"particularly the NDIS\"."

Investors traded more cautiously ahead of a meeting between US President Joe Biden, Republican House Speaker Kevin McCarthy and other congressional leaders at the White House on Tuesday (local time), to discuss the debt ceiling stand-off. The Dow Jones, S & P 500 and Nasdaq Composite fell by 0.2%, 0.5% and 0.6%, respectively. Markets are waiting to hear the outcome of a meeting on Tuesday (local time) between US President Joe Biden, Worries of a potential government default loom over Washington as early as June 1, if Congress does not act to resolve the deadlock. The Democratic president is calling on lawmakers to raise the federal government's self-imposed borrowing limit without conditions. But the Republican House speaker, Mr McCarthy, has said his chamber will not approve any deal that does not cut spending to address a growing budget deficit. Past debt ceiling fights have typically ended with a hastily arranged agreement in the final hours of negotiations, thus avoiding a default. In 2011, the scramble prompted a downgrade of the country's top-notch credit rating. Veterans of that battle warn the current situation is even riskier because political divides have widened. Economists warn a lengthy default could send the US economy into a deep recession with soaring unemployment, while destabilising the global financial system that's built on US bonds."

If you're not - say you've been late with paying your bills or defaulted on a mortgage - you're pay a higher interest rates on loans to take account of the fact you're more risky (for the lender) than other people. For nation's it's similar. Ratings agencies work out if you, a company or a nation are a 'good risk'. New comments from Fitch Ratings in the wake of the 2023 Australian federal budget are broadly supportive \"The return to a underlying cash surplus in the current fiscal year and clear improvement in the federal government's fiscal position over the budget's forecast horizon is supportive of Australia's 'AAA' sovereign rating,\" said Jeremy Zook, director, sovereigns, APAC at Fitch Ratings. \"Fiscal outcomes are stronger than what we expected when we last affirmed Australia's rating with a Stable outlook in December 2022.\" It also says the budget won't boost inflation. \"The government's decision to allow higher than expected revenue collection to flow through to improved budget outcomes by keeping spending relatively contained, points to a commitment to its fiscal strategy and is not likely to contribute to inflationary pressures in the economy. We think the budget assumptions are reasonable and commodity price assumptions remain modest compared to our forecasts. Still, downside risks persist given the weak global outlook, elevated inflation and high interest rates Mr Zook does see \"structural budget pressures\" over the medium-term and warns that risks to the rating could build with spending demands \"particularly the NDIS\".",

Investors traded more cautiously ahead of a meeting between US President Joe Biden, Republican House Speaker Kevin McCarthy and other congressional leaders at the White House on Tuesday (local time), to discuss the debt ceiling stand-off. The Dow Jones, S & P 500 and Nasdaq Composite fell by 0.2%, 0.5% and 0.6%, respectively. Markets are waiting to hear the outcome of a meeting on Tuesday (local time) between US President Joe Biden, Worries of a potential government default loom over Washington as early as June 1, if Congress does not act to resolve the deadlock. The Democratic president is calling on lawmakers to raise the federal government's self-imposed borrowing limit without conditions. But the Republican House speaker, Mr McCarthy, has said his chamber will not approve any deal that does not cut spending to address a growing budget deficit. Past debt ceiling fights have typically ended with a hastily arranged agreement in the final hours of negotiations, thus avoiding a default. In 2011, the scramble prompted a downgrade of the country's top-notch credit rating. Veterans of that battle warn the current situation is even riskier because political divides have widened. Economists warn a lengthy default could send the US economy into a deep recession with soaring unemployment, while destabilising the global financial system that's built on US bonds.",
