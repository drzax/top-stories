But those people lucky enough to get on these flights are certainly more fortunate than the 1 million or so people who live in Gaza City. \"The Israeli army has given them 24 hours to evacuate, to move to the south of the Gaza Strip in a clear sign that a ground invasion is imminent. For the elderly, the frail, the disabled, those unable to leave quickly, they could be facing the full wrath of the most powerful army in the Middle East.\"",
