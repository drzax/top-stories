He spoke to colleague Emily Stewart for her story on The Business tonight. On Mr Lowe's comments on better co-operation with government he said: \"The importance, I think of a greater alignment between monetary policy and fiscal policy, I think is very insightful, we do rely very heavily on monetary policy, high interest rates to control inflation. But as he [Mr Lowe] points out, that can have a very unequal impact on people through society, obviously, particularly impacting those with with very high debt levels and obviously facing the impact of high mortgage rates.\" When it comes to calling out productivity : \"I think he's also right to continue to point out the importance of boosting productivity. If we don't do that, if we don't build a consensus, as he says, to do that, then we will see our living standard suffer.\" And on Mr Lowe's comments about the media Dr Oliver said this: \"I think he also rightly pointed out that the media has a role to play in this as well, and he has been somewhat misinterpreted on several occasions in recent times, which has made the setting of monetary policy at least the communication of monetary policy, but more complicated than it otherwise needed to be.\" Dr Oliver also noted the tarnish that will forever be Mr Lowe's legacy: \"I think there's no doubt that Governor Lowe's legacy has been marred to some degree by the interest rate guidance in 2021, where he said that based on their current expectations, they didn't expect to raise interest rates until 2024. And of course, they had to start doing rate hikes through last year and of course, that threw many people ou t and got into the housing market. But by the same token, his heart was in the right place at the time, he was very fearful that the recovery in the economy would be very slow and consequently, unemployment would stay very high. So he was trying to provide confidence. It's always hard to know for sure, but I suspect that it did influence many people, otherwise, he wouldn't have made that guidance in the first place. He was he was hoping to encourage people to go out there and borrow and invest in housing and help the recovery in the economy. So I think there's no doubt that it had some impact people.\" You can see Emily's story on The Business tonight and on the ABC News YouTube channel later too.",

Other companies are eyeing it off. On Monday this week another lithium miner Albemarle upped its offer to buy Liontown, increasing it to $3 a share, valuing Liontown at $6.6 billion. The $3 offer was higher than Albemarle's $2.50 offer back in March - Liontown rejected that back then saying it was far too low. Liontown shares rose to about $2.89 on Monday, but this afternoon they've soared again, jumping 8.3 per cent to now be valued at that Albemarle offer of $3 a share. It's fulling speculation there may be a rival bid in the works for Liontown, with some reports saying i ron ore mogul Gina Rinehart could be behind it. She is said to hold just under a 5 per cent stake in the company already. Albemarle has been pursuing Liontown since October last year, when it made a $2.20 a share offer.",
