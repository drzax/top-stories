As thousands massed on the Rafah border crossing with Egypt — the only one in the Gaza Strip not controlled by Israel — Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ruled out a temporary ceasefire to allow aid supplies in or foreigners out. On Monday evening, strikes hit an area near the crossing, an AFP reporter said. UN humanitarian chief Martin Griffiths is heading to the Middle East on Tuesday in the latest effort of frantic diplomacy to prevent the crisis worsening. \"We need access for aid,\" he said in a video statement. The regional director of the World Health Organization, Ahmed Al-Mandhari, gave a stark warning about the situation, which he said was barrelling towards a \"real catastrophe\". There are 24 hours of water, electricity and fuel left in Gaza, he told AFP in an interview in Cairo. If aid is not allowed in, doctors will have to \"prepare death certificates for their patients\", he added AFP",
