When asked whether collective punishment by cutting off water and electricity was justified, Mr Halevy said there were no rules when it came to terror. He also warned Israel had a lot of ways of making things very difficult for Hamas. \"We cannot forget they (Hamas) are a terrorist group and in combating terror you cannot simply go by the book,\" he said.",
