                  "articleBody": "In the US, the benchmark S & P 500 declined 0.7 per cent to end the session at 4,061. It was its fourth-straight session of declines. The Nasdaq declined 0.5 per cent to 11,966, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 0.9 per cent to 33,127. The sell-off came as fears grew about the strength of the US banking sector. PacWest's stock slumped more than 40 per cent in afternoon trading, dropping to a record low. Western Alliance shares pared losses after plummeting by nearly 60 per cent following a Financial Times report that the lender was exploring strategic options, including a potential sale of all or part of its business. However, Western Alliance denied the report, calling it \"categorically false in all respects\", and said it was weighing legal options against the newspaper. The bank's stock was down nearly 35 per cent in afternoon trading. Western Alliance has been seeking to reassure investors about its financial stability. It comes as First Republic's collapse, the third major casualty of the biggest crisis to hit the US banking sector since 2008, rekindled a slide in shares of regional lenders this week despite regulatory efforts to staunch the turmoil that began with the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank in March. US officials at the federal and state levels are assessing the possibility of \"market manipulation\" behind big moves in banking share prices in recent days, Reuters has reported. \"Nobody knows where these banks should be trading at because what we saw with Silicon Valley Bank is that the fundamentals can change so quickly,\" Tom Plumb, portfolio manager at Plumb Balanced Fund said. \"This normally would have been a great opportunity to buy banks with premier regional presence and it may be, but the real concern is nobody knows what the rules are and what they are valued at,\" Mr Plumb added. The KBW Regional Banking index dropped 3.3 per cent. Major U.S. banks were also losing ground on Thursday, with the S & P 500 Banks index falling nearly 3 per cent. JPMorgan's shares fell 1.4 per cent, while Bank of America declined 3 per cent. The common theme among the banking stocks that have sold off sharply is that they reported large deposit declines in the first quarter, said Truist Securities analyst Brandon King, while calling the selloff \"overdone.\" PacWest Bancorp reported a loss of $1.1 billion attributed to shareholders for the first quarter of the year. - with Reuters"

The Nasdaq declined 0.5 per cent to 11,966, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 0.9 per cent to 33,127. The sell-off came as fears grew about the strength of the US banking sector. PacWest's stock slumped more than 40 per cent in afternoon trading, dropping to a record low. Western Alliance shares pared losses after plummeting by nearly 60 per cent following a Financial Times report that the lender was exploring strategic options, including a potential sale of all or part of its business. However, Western Alliance denied the report, calling it \"categorically false in all respects\", and said it was weighing legal options against the newspaper. The bank's stock was down nearly 35 per cent in afternoon trading. Western Alliance has been seeking to reassure investors about its financial stability. It comes as First Republic's collapse, the third major casualty of the biggest crisis to hit the US banking sector since 2008, rekindled a slide in shares of regional lenders this week despite regulatory efforts to staunch the turmoil that began with the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank in March. US officials at the federal and state levels are assessing the possibility of \"market manipulation\" behind big moves in banking share prices in recent days, Reuters has reported. \"Nobody knows where these banks should be trading at because what we saw with Silicon Valley Bank is that the fundamentals can change so quickly,\" Tom Plumb, portfolio manager at Plumb Balanced Fund said. \"This normally would have been a great opportunity to buy banks with premier regional presence and it may be, but the real concern is nobody knows what the rules are and what they are valued at,\" Mr Plumb added. The KBW Regional Banking index dropped 3.3 per cent. Major U.S. banks were also losing ground on Thursday, with the S & P 500 Banks index falling nearly 3 per cent. JPMorgan's shares fell 1.4 per cent, while Bank of America declined 3 per cent. The common theme among the banking stocks that have sold off sharply is that they reported large deposit declines in the first quarter, said Truist Securities analyst Brandon King, while calling the selloff \"overdone.\" PacWest Bancorp reported a loss of $1.1 billion attributed to shareholders for the first quarter of the year. - with Reuters",

The Nasdaq declined 0.5 per cent to 11,966, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 0.9 per cent to 33,127. The sell-off came as fears grew about the strength of the US banking sector. PacWest's stock slumped more than 40 per cent in afternoon trading, dropping to a record low. Western Alliance shares pared losses after plummeting by nearly 60 per cent following a Financial Times report that the lender was exploring strategic options, including a potential sale of all or part of its business. However, Western Alliance denied the report, calling it \"categorically false in all respects\", and said it was weighing legal options against the newspaper. The bank's stock was down nearly 35 per cent in afternoon trading. Western Alliance has been seeking to reassure investors about its financial stability. It comes as First Republic's collapse, the third major casualty of the biggest crisis to hit the US banking sector since 2008, rekindled a slide in shares of regional lenders this week despite regulatory efforts to staunch the turmoil that began with the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank in March. US officials at the federal and state levels are assessing the possibility of \"market manipulation\" behind big moves in banking share prices in recent days, Reuters has reported. \"Nobody knows where these banks should be trading at because what we saw with Silicon Valley Bank is that the fundamentals can change so quickly,\" Tom Plumb, portfolio manager at Plumb Balanced Fund said. \"This normally would have been a great opportunity to buy banks with premier regional presence and it may be, but the real concern is nobody knows what the rules are and what they are valued at,\" Mr Plumb added. The KBW Regional Banking index dropped 3.3 per cent. Major U.S. banks were also losing ground on Thursday, with the S & P 500 Banks index falling nearly 3 per cent. JPMorgan's shares fell 1.4 per cent, while Bank of America declined 3 per cent. The common theme among the banking stocks that have sold off sharply is that they reported large deposit declines in the first quarter, said Truist Securities analyst Brandon King, while calling the selloff \"overdone.\" PacWest Bancorp reported a loss of $1.1 billion attributed to shareholders for the first quarter of the year. - with Reuters",
