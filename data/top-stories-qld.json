So, how much of our energy needs are being met by renewable sources? Daniel Westerman, who is the boss of the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO), told AM it fluctuates. \"In fact in the National Electricity Market, we've experienced times of up to 68% of our power fed by renewable energy. \"On average, though, throughout the year, it's about a third. The remaining two thirds a little bit less is powered by these old coal fired power stations to the closing down. \"That really does signal the transition that over the next decade, we expect a significant number to retire to be replaced by the cheapest form of new build energy, which is renewable energy backed up by storage and connected with transmission. \"The challenge for us is to make sure that those new projects get and built in a timely fashion.\"",
