The communiqué details 20 resolutions from the meeting, condemning what it calls Israel's \"blatant and unprecedented aggression\" in the occupied territories and the resulting displacement of Palestinians in the Gaza Strip. The OIC calls on member states to \"apply all feasible and effective diplomatic, legal and deterrent measures, to stop the occupying power Israel's crimes against humanity\". The communiqué also calls on \"international actors to engage in sponsoring a serious political path to achieve peace based on ending the illegal Israeli occupation that had begun in 1967 and implementing the two-state solution\". But it does not mention Hamas's deadly cross-border terrorist attack launched on southern Israeli communities on October 7. You can read the communique in full here. The OIC is an intergovernmental committee of 57 states including countries such as Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, Iran, Egypt, Jordan and Lebanon.",

In an update posted online, the World Food Programme warned that Gaza was running out of food, and called for \"unimpeded access and safe passage\" to deliver supplies. \"Our food supplies inside Gaza are running really short, but in the meantime, food supplies are being stockpiled in the Egyptian city of Al-Arish and close to the Gaza border to be dispatched as soon as the border access is granted,\" spokesperson Abeer Etefa said in a video posted to X. Earlier today the White House announced Egypt's president had agreed to open the Rafah Crossing to allow about 20 trucks carrying aid into Gaza, with hopes for more to be allowed in later. The WFP said it had been working with 23 bakeries inside Gaza to distribute bread to shelters, but as of this morning 19 had stopped operating, mostly due to fuel shortages.",
