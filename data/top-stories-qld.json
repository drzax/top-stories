Not only that, but the net debt is down to $516.7 billion. That is quite the substantial turnaround — just last month, the federal government noted its cash underlying surplus was just $8.9 billion, whereas now it's a staggering $20.4 billion. It sure does make that modest $4.2 billion budget surplus we heard about on budget night much, much smaller in comparison. As economist Chris Richardson points out, the sudden appearance of funds comes at a time when the economy is slowing, and household budgets are feeling the strain. So why the big turnaround? \"The biggest contributor was that Treasury hadn’t fully allowed for the impact of war and inflation on the nation’s finances,\" Mr Richardson wrote.
