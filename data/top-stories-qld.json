Hi Natty — even if you haven't been a Latitude customer directly, you might have applied for a financial product with them years ago, before they were even known as Latitude Financial. Before the Latitude brand became a household name (and a feature on the back of the Richmond Tigers guernsey, if you're AFL inclined like myself), they were GE Money — and have quite the history, including as Coles and Myer-branded credit cards. I did a deep dive on Latitude's history back in April, which you can read below. Hopefully it sheds some light into why you might have been contacted (and sorry to hear you've been caught up in their cyber breach).",

The company self-reported the underpayments — which date back to 2010 — last week. It has estimated correcting the issue will cost more than $400 million, with superannuation and interest. Fair Work Ombudsman, Sandra Parker, has told ABC Radio Perth it may well be an oversight, but is disappointed by the company's \"negligence\". \"Our concern is how can there be an oversight and a mistake that runs for 13 years without there being negligence and neglect on the part of the company,\" she said. \"BHP itself said it's not good enough — that's right, it's not good enough for any employer — let alone one of Australia's largest and most sophisticated employers to underpay their employees on such a large scale.\"",
