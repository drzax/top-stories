The proposed changes would see BNPL services regulated as a credit product, albeit with a lighter touch than loans and credit cards. Block, the owner of Afterpay, was down -1.6% to $87.75 around 11:30am AEST. \"Today's announcement from the Government is a strong first step in the development of a fit-for-purpose Buy Now Pay Later regulatory framework that embeds effective consumer protections, generates positive outcomes for consumers and businesses, and provides certainty for industry,\" Afterpay said in a statement, adding that it wouldn't be doing any on-camera interviews at this stage. While it may have to overhaul it's operations in Australia to comply with some of the requirements around credit licensing and checks, the BNPL market here is a relatively small part of its global payments footprint. ASX-listed Humm Group has also welcomed the changes. \"hummgroup fully supports the Government's position to enhance consumer protection measures and has previously advocated for bringing BNPL within the application of the National Credit Code and the requirements associated with it,\" it said in a statement. \"In its submission to the Treasury Options Paper, hummgroup supported the requirement for BNPL providers to comply with responsible lending obligations which are calibrated to the level of risk of BNPL products and services (Option 2). \"The Company is particularly supportive of the requirements for BNPL companies to hold a credit licence, conduct scalable lending checks tailored to risk and have complaints and hardship policies in line with regulated products.\" Humm shares were up 1.2% to 42.5 cents by midday AEST. Zip, which already has an Australian Credit Licence (ACL), has welcomed the government's proposal. \"Zip has been advocating for fit for purpose regulation since as far back as 2019,\" said the company's co-founder Peter Gray told RN Breakfast. \"We generally believe it provides a sensible balance between consumer protection and minimum standards, but also supporting competition and innovation.\" Mr Gray said he doesn't foresee many changes to the way his firm operates and the regulation is \"likely to be a competitive advantage\" for the company, which would not cost it customers. \"For Zip, it's actually business as usual,\" he argued. \"We already hold an Australian Credit Licence, we do offer regulated credit. We have been conducting ID, credit, banking and affordability checks on all our customers.\" Zip investors disagreed, with its share price down 5.7% to $0.5425 around 11:30am AEST.

Assistant Treasurer and Minister for Financial Services Stephen Jones has told ABC business reporter Nassim Khadem that it's possible that the matter will be referred to the Australian Federal Police for potential criminal investigations. \"We've got Treasury looking at an investigation into what has occurred, and looking at whether criminal charges should be referred to the AFP ,\" he said. \"We're all appalled with what's gone on with PwC. We want to send a very clear message to them, and anyone else who's providing services to government, that you cannot breach the trust of the government or the Australian people. \"So if criminal charges or other charges can be laid, we're looking forward to the outcomes of that investigation from Treasury.\" Nassim asked the minister whether the government might also hit PwC via its partners' hip pockets. \"And so are you reviewing current government contracts [with PwC]?\" \"The Finance Minister and Treasury are looking at all of the options that are available to us,\" Mr Jones responded. Treasurer Jim Chalmers was slightly more circumspect on RN Breakfast, but also flagged further action against PwC. \"We've taken some steps, there will be more steps to take,\" he told Patricia Karvelas. \"I'm working on them almost literally right now, and I'll have more to say about it in due course.\" The ABC's business editor Ian Verrender had some strong analysis last week on the PwC scandal.",
