Here's how our reporter at the ground Kate O'Halloran saw that half: It has been a clinical performance so far from the number two ranked Germans, who have kept excitable debutants Morocco at bay with polish and class. Both first half goals were headed in by likely suspect Alex Popp. The first came in the 11th minute, the captain getting on the end of an excellent cross from Kathrin Hendrich. Popp scored again in the 39th minute, this time with a diving effort to her left, just on the edge of the box. It takes Popp to fourth on the all-time German goal-scoring list, shoring up her reputation for performing under pressure, having now scored in six consecutive major tournaments. The Atlas Lionesses have been far from disgraced, however, despite being ranked 70 places below the powerhouse German side. At 0-2, Fatima Tagnouti looked to have the best chance for Morocco, played in behind for a one-on-one confrontation with German goalkeeper Merle Frohms, but was unable to pass her. She was later ruled offside.",
