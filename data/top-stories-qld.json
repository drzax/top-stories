For integrated property groups such as Goodman Group, who own, develop, and manage properties, raising funds in an environment of rising interest rates can be a challenge, as is raising rents and increasing profits. \"For owners of shopping centres, such as Stockland Group who have retailers as tenants - in the current environment of soft trading updates, retailers simply cannot afford to pay higher rent. \"Furthermore, presuming the current consumer slowdown continues and costs increase (higher wages), retailers’ earnings will likely continue to fall and will soon result in profit warnings and eventually requests for rent reductions. \"All of which is a direct result of the impact of higher interest rates. As noted above, when taming inflation is the priority, nothing else matters.\" He's included this chart to show the Property Sector index has performed since the start of 2022.",

Anna Bligh, CEO of the Australian Banking Association, says more customers are \"thinking of what other options they might have\" if rising rates make it \"impossible\" for some customers to keep up with their repayments. She encouraged borrowers who are struggling to call their bank to discuss their options sooner rather than later. \"There are very practical ways that banks can help to ease the financial pressure, temporarily, for several months,\" she said. \"They can put you on an interest-only arrangement, they can, in some cases, defer payments for a period of time.\" You can listen to the full interview between Hamish Macdonald and Anna Bligh via the RN Breakfast website .",
