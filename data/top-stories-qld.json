They haven't played a public friendly match since April, where they bounced back from a slim 1-0 loss to Scotland to post maybe the best result of the Tony Gustavsson era when they defeated World Cup favourites England 2-0 in London. Since then, the final 23 players have completed their respective club seasons before joining up in a pre-tournament training camp on the Gold Coast, where they've been rehabbing little niggles, reacquainting themselves with one other, and rehearsing their plans to tackle Republic of Ireland, Nigeria, and Canada in the group stage. And lemme say, their social media campaigns in the meantime have me HYPED. At the Matildas' media day in early July, all players who were carrying injuries - including Kyah Simon - said they were fit and ready to be selected for tonight's game against France, so it'll be interesting to see whether Gustavsson uses this opportunity to test out some of those bodies, especially those who've been sidelined for a while such as Alanna Kennedy and Mary Fowler. If you've got a bit of time, you can read my analysis of the Matildas' final squad - including whether they can address the problems that the 2019 tournament exposed - below.",

My name is Sam Lewis and I'm joining you from a sold-out Marvel Stadium in Naarm, Melbourne for a super exciting clash between two nations expected to go far in the tournament that is now less than a week away (gulp). It's kinda poetic that the 2019 Women's World Cup hosts are meeting the 2023 co-hosts for this final tune-up, especially given the two nations could meet each other once again at the quarter-final stage depending on the permutations of their respective groups. Matildas boss Tony Gustavsson said earlier this week that he's not expecting to give all his secrets away tonight, so the players and football we see could differ slightly from those who will trot out onto the Stadium Australia pitch against the Republic of Ireland on July 20. Same for France: they've got a new head coach in Herve Renard, who took over from the problematic Corinne Diacre only a few months ago, so this game will be an interesting test of just how far this group of players have come under the former Saudi Arabia boss. Either way, how good is it to have some live football back on home shores? What a delightful appetizer to the main course that's to come next week. But before we get into a bit more chat, tell me: where are you watching tonight's game from? Log in and let me know!",
