It's all because yesterday it announced a billion-dollar funding package for its flagship Kathleen Valley lithium project, planning to raise $376 million in a discounted share placement and $760 million via debt. Funding plans had to change because earlier in the week US-based Albemarle Corp withdrew its $6.6 billion buyout bid, citing 'growing complexities.' The withdrawal came days after Hancock Prospecting (Gina Rinehart's company!) raised its stake to 19.9% of Liontown (which would have been enough to block the Albemarle bid of $3 per share). The Kathleen Valley project is widely regarded as one of the world's top five lithium projects, and Liontown has already signed deals to supply Ford Motor and Tesla. Here's a chart showing you Liontown's shareprice over the last 10 days. Talk about a slide!",

The other 10 sectors are lower, led by basic materials (-1.55%), academic and educational services (-1.42%) and real estate (-1.35%).
