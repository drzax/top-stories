The three major indexes gave up earlier advances, losing momentum as the session progressed and investors digested the data ahead of the long US holiday weekend. The S & P 500 and the Dow ended modestly green, while the tech-laden Nasdaq closed nearly unchanged. All three indexes notched gains on the week. \"Today, people are coasting into the holiday weekend with relief that the job numbers were solid,\" said Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist at Carson Group in Omaha. \"There are signs of the economy slowing, which is what the Fed wants to see,\" Detrick added. \"It likely opens the door for no rate hike at the next Fed meeting in three weeks.\" The Labor Department's payrolls report showed the US economy added more jobs than expected last month, but the rising unemployment and participation rates, along with a welcome cool-down in average hourly wage growth, solidified expectations that the Fed will let key interest rates stand this month. Financial markets are pricing in a 93 per cent likelihood of such a pause this month, according to CME's FedWatch tool. But what the Fed will do beyond September remains an open question.",
