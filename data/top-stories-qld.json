More than 15 years since the Intervention, many Aboriginal leaders say it left NT communities disempowered and disenfranchised, and contributed to the level of social issues faced today. Ms Martin was the Labor NT government's leader when then-prime minister John Howard's Coalition triggered the Intervention, to try to combat what it believed at the time was a surge in sexual assaults against children. \"If there's ever anywhere that needs a strong national Voice to stop federal governments doing really stupid things in the territory, then it's this Voice,\" Ms Martin said. \"I'm a product of the Intervention, which John Howard did because he wanted to win votes elsewhere. \"That was an extraordinary waste of money and a damage for Aboriginal people. \"If we had a Voice, we would never have had an Intervention.\" Mr Howard last week told an Australians for Constitutional Monarchy conference that he defended his government's decision to start the Intervention, saying it was a \"recognition that … the Northern Territory government, had completely failed in its responsibilities\".",

UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric said earlier that it would be \"impossible for such a movement to take place without devastating humanitarian consequences\". \"The United Nations strongly appeals for any such order, if confirmed, to be rescinded, avoiding what could transform what is already a tragedy into a calamitous situation,\" he said. Mr Erdan hit back by saying that \"the UN's response to Israel's early warning to the residents of Gaza is a disgrace!\". Mr Erdan said the UN should focus on condemning Hamas and supporting Israel's right to self-defence. \"For many years, the UN turned a blind eye to the arming of Hamas and its use of civilian populations and infrastructure in the Gaza Strip for murder and for stockpiling its weapons,\" he said. Salama Marouf, head of the Hamas government media office, said the relocation warning was an attempt by Israel \"to broadcast and pass on fake propaganda, aiming to sow confusion among citizens and harm our internal cohesion.\" He added: \"We urge our citizens not to engage in these attempts.\" Reuters/ABC",
