That is for owner occupiers and investors with a deposit greater than 20 per cent. The 0.1 percentage point rise is on top of official rate rises by the Reserve Bank. That means NAB's lowest variable rate home loan has increased by 0.75 per cent since March 1 for new customers, while existing customers have seen their rates increase by 0.5 percentage points. Canstar says it is the second variable home loan rate increase from NAB in less than a fortnight. It's also the fourth time the lender has increased variable rates out of cycle with the RBA's cash rate decisions according to Canstar. Canstar’s finance expert, Steve Mickenbecker says it is bad news for borrowers as smaller lenders are also likely to follow suit. “﻿NAB’s second variable home loan rate increase in a fortnight will further disturb borrowers already shell-shocked after a year of rate hikes.” “The Reserve Bank cash rate rise in May had already added $79 to the monthly repayment on a $500,000 basic variable loan at NAB, and the 0.10 per cent rise tops this up to $112. “Bank margins are coming under pressure as depositors are finally starting to receive the full benefit of Reserve Bank cash rate increases, and other funding costs have already risen to more normal levels after the years of COVID support.\" “Out of cycle increases by the big banks will ease the pressure on smaller lenders that are without large deposit bases, potentially allowing them to reprice their home loans to cover their higher cost of funding.\" RateCity says all the big four banks have increased new customer rates in the last three months, in addition to the RBA rate hikes in March and May.",
