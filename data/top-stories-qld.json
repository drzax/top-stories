Here's some of the conversation: Sabra Lane: Did you meet or talk with Alan Joyce or any other Qantas representative before making this decision? Catherine King: I certainly routinely meet with the CEOs of all of the airlines. And of course, that would include Alan Joyce, so I routinely meet with all of the CEOs of the airlines, airports, peak bodies. SL: I'm sorry, it's a pretty simple question. Did you meet with Alan Joyce before making this decision? CK: I would have certainly met, you know, I have been a minister for 15 months, I would certainly in that 15 months have met with the CEO of all of the airlines, including the former CEO of Qantas. But can I say, from the best of my recollection, when it comes to this matter in particular, I received more lobbying on behalf of Qatar, both from Virgin, but also into my office from a third party than I did from Qantas on this issue. SL: In the immediate period before you made this decision, did you meet with Alan Joyce? CK: I'd have to go back and check, but I always meet with CEOs of airlines when they ask to do so. But can I absolutely make it very clear, the discussions that Qantas had with me and my office have on the whole been about same job, same pay, not about this decision. SL: Surely though, you would remember a conversation like this? CK: I don't remember a conversation like this, but I can't be 100% sure they didn't have a conversation with someone in my office or someone in my department. So I am being careful to let you know very clearly that by the best of my recollection, where I was lobbied about this issue was on the whole on behalf of Qatar, and Qantas discussions that I had, as I said in the parliament yesterday, were primarily about same job, same pay. I know that my department as is proper processes, undertook consultation with industry about this issue. And I was well aware of all of the stakeholder views in relation to this decision when I made it.",

Qantas lobbied the government against the decision, but Virgin and Qatar put reasons to the government about why it should go ahead. Meanwhile, five Australian women onboard a Qatar flight in 20-20 — who were forced to undergo invasive body examinations — encouraged the Ms King not to approve the flights. Yesterday it was confirmed Ms King sent a letter to the women involved in the incident the same day she denied Qatar's request. At a press conference this morning, she maintains the decision was in the national interest — but didn't expand on what \"national interest\" means. \"As I've said repeatedly, I made this decision in the national interest, and there is no one factor that I will point to that swayed my decision one way or the other,\" she said. \"In making this decision, I did have the national interest — not commercial interests — at play when I was making that decision. \"I don't think that it helps for me to point to any one factor. We make decisions in the national interest all of the time.\"",

The proceedings allege PayPal Australia's contracts with small business customers contained an \"unfair\" term that gave business account holders 60 days to notify PayPal of any errors or discrepancies in fees they had been charged, or accept them as accurate. \"ASIC alleges the term is unfair because the effect of the term is to permit PayPal to retain fees it has overcharged or wrongly charged if the small business does not notify PayPal of the error within 60 days of the fee appearing in its account statement,\" the watchdog's statement said. ASIC's deputy chair Sarah Court said the legal action was about protecting the interests of small businesses. \"We allege this term is unfair because it allows PayPal to escape the consequences of its own errors in overcharging small businesses, and places additional burdens on small businesses to detect and correct charging errors,\" she said.
