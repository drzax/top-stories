Let's get you up to speed with the major developments from the US overnight: Stronger than expected economic data and new comments from Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell has stoked fears more rate rises are on the way in the US — he told an event in Madrid the Fed's expectation is for \"the moderate pace of interest rate decisions to continue\" The data has also eased potential recession fears, thanks to Treasury yields pushing higher and leading investors to economically sensitive sectors Major banks were also up at the end of trade, after the lenders cleared the Fed's annual stress test The tech-heavy Nasdaq finished flat, after major tech companies including Microsoft, Amazon, Meta and Nvidia suffered losses throughout the day So what does Friday have in store for us locally? The ASX is looking like it will open slightly higher with futures up modestly, but it's looking to be a fairly subdued day as we race towards the end of the financial year. One piece of data that's coming out that we'll be keeping an eye on is private sector credit, which will give us a snapshot into housing lending for May. We'll have those figures at 11:30am AEST from the ABS. And it would be remiss of me not to mention the *other* big news of the day — Taylor Swift tickets going on general sale. Good luck if you're one of the four million Aussies braving the queue for the first (or second, or third, or fourth) time. Let's dive on in. (If you're not a Swiftie and need some context, that's her swan diving on stage.)",
