The most interesting was some modelling done by a senior analyst in the Economic Analysis Department in September last year that found Australia had between a 50 to 80% chance of recession if the Reserve Bank was successful in returning inflation below 3% by late-2024. If the bank was a bit slower in lowering inflation, leaving it just above the target band by the end of 2024, recession risk could be as low as 30 per cent, depending which model was used. But that is still much higher than the 5 per cent chance of recession Australia would normally have according to recent history, and 13 per cent odds over a longer historical period. I spoke to Kath Robinson about it on The Business last night. There was some other research, from earlier this year, that modelled the effects of different interest rate paths on inflation and unemployment. Some of those models looked at a cash rate as high as 4.8 per cent, but the RBA's most recent forecasts and actions make it look very unlikely it will push rates that far.

Overnight, struggling bank PacWest saw its shares dive a further 22.7% after its deposits dropped nearly 10 per cent last week, as savers seek the relative safety of larger institutions. From highs of just under $30 in early February, it's shares ended trade overnight at $4.70. Westpac's Imre Speizer said the US Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation announced some further moves to try and stabilise the banking system overnight. \"The US FDIC announced plans to increase fees on all large banks (assets over USD50bn) in order to help covering insured (and potentially uninsured) deposits,\" he noted. \"The proposals also indicated that holders of bank shares would not be protected.\" The KBW regional bank index ended down 2.4% overall. The other big loser on Wall Street was Walt Disney Corporation, which slumped 8.7% after losing subscribers to its Disney+ streaming service. The following wrap on Disney's quarterly results from Reuters: The decline erased about $16 billion from the company's market value and marked the stock's sharpest single-day fall since Bob Iger's return in November as Disney CEO. Shares of Warner Bros Discovery and Paramount Global fell more than 3%. \"Disney+ is losing less money not because it's gaining subscribers but because of its price hikes and better cost management,\" said Mike Proulx, an analyst at Forrester. \"Cutting marketing dollars is at odds with growing subscribers.\" Operating losses at the streaming unit narrowed by $US400 million in the second quarter from the previous three months, helped by a price hike last December in the US and Canada. The company plans to raise the price of the ad-free Disney+ service again this year and it will also remove certain low-viewership content from its services to cut costs. \"Some investors might question this tactic given Disney just lost subscribers,\" said KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst Brandon Nispel. \"However, it seems the goal is to drive more subscribers toward Disney+'s ad-supported tier … which the company believes could improve monetization.\"",
