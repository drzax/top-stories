The other sector which saw a fall in turnover was food and accommodation services. We've heard a lot about post-COVID 'revenge spending', with people still forking out on dining and travel even as cost of living pressures mount, after several lockdown-disrupted years. However, accommodation and food services saw an 0.3 per cent decline in turnover in the month, after rising for three months.

Energy stocks remain the standout, while the major miners are now mixed, with Rio Tinto shares slipping into the red.

It follows some weaker-than-expected economic data out of China, with consumer prices barely budging from a year earlier.",
