The passengers are the biggest group of repatriated Australians from Gaza to land back in the country on a single commercial flight. Over the weekend a family of four also landed in Adelaide and another family of three touched down in Melbourne. ABC News was at the airport last night, where some said they were extremely happy and relieved to be home. Others spoke about the horror and trauma their family and friends are still facing in Gaza. The Department of Foreign Affairs says that they have now helped about 25 Australians and their family members leave Gaza, and they're still trying to help evacuate a further 67 Australian citizens and their family members.",

Mr Morrison and former British prime minister Boris Johnson toured kibbutz Kfar Aza, a community on the Gaza border that was attacked by Hamas on October 7. The Israeli military told them Hamas militants using gliders and motorbikes attacked the kibbutz, killing 57 residents and kidnapping 17. Mr Morrison is the first Australian political figure to visit Israel since this conflict began. \"You can't help but be overwhelmed by the sense of what we're standing was once, a month ago, a place of innocence and now has been desecrated beyond comprehension,\" he said. Walking through the wreckage of homes, as Israeli artillery fired nearby, Mr Johnson wanted his visit to remind the world what happened here. \"I do worry that in the month that has passed since those atrocities, a kind of moral fog has descended,\" he said. \"I personally utterly reject any attempt to equate the terrorism of Hamas with the work of the Israel Defense Forces to make sure this never happens again.\"",
