Asked in a radio interview about a hypothetical nuclear option, Mr Eliyahu had replied: \"That's one way.\" \"This has raised a huge number of questions,\" Maria Zakharova, Russia's foreign ministry spokeswoman, was quoted as saying by state RIA news agency. Ms Zakharova said the main issue was Israel appeared to have admit it has nuclear weapons. Israel does not publicly acknowledge it has nuclear weapons though the Federation of American Scientists estimates Israel has about 90 nuclear warheads. \"Question number one — it turns out that we are hearing official statements about the presence of nuclear weapons?\" Ms Zakharova said. The remark by Mr Eliyahu has drawn condemnation from around the Arab world, scandalised mainstream Israeli broadcasters, and been deemed \"objectionable\" by a US official. Reuters",
