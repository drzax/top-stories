Michelle: I'd like some advice about our two Golden Retrievers - a 2 yr old female and 1 yr old male. Both pull on the lead when walked together but are easier to manage on their own; they're very strong dogs and we use a harness with a clip near their chest to try and reduce the pulling. Nicole: I have a 10 month old heeler x lab who is a very good boy, except he's a lead puller. Any suggestions? I was wondering when this question might rear it's head! As someone who used to have a very enthusiastic Golden Retriever I'm also very interested in the answer... Throwing this one over to our dog behaviourist Laura V. Laura V: This is not an uncommon question. When a dog is on lead, they have the control of their movement limited, which can make them anxious and frustrated. It's kind of like... if you close a door, you want to get out; but if the door is open, you are more comfortable to stick around. So, my suggestion is to make being on the lead a reward within itself. This needs to begin at home under little distraction, so you and your dog can focus on each other. On the lead, reward her looking up at you and walking alongside you at home. Change direction often to make it more of a game and make it fun. I don't mind dogs walking ahead, so if your dog is safe and comfortable, you can invest in a longer lead too, which will allow your dog a little more sniffing freedom, and reduce the pulling (not a retractable lead though!!). Gradually increase the distractions, until the game is so great you can take it out on a walk. Don't forget rewards and make sure you don't run out. For some dogs, it's food, others it's a ball or a tug toy. Your dog will tell you what they want to engage with.",

Here's Dr Karishma Dahia : Dr Karishma: There is no specific time limit that you should try alternative treatments for. It all depends on the type of treatment. For example there are some great pheromone collars and diffusers that can aid in calming our pets that typically work best within 24 hours — 7 days. And other natural oral calming medications which can take a few weeks to see improvement. Of course, some owners may notice improvements sooner or later than this. Or, owners may notice slight improvement in behaviour but not complete resolvement. Don't disregard this, rather stick with it and even add in other therapies in combination as multi-modal therapy is often best. As a general rule it's good to be patient and give most new remedies and alternate medications a few weeks to see if they are having any effect. And not to use them in isolation, but rather use them with modification and enrichment of the home environment.",

Susan: We have a 1yo beagle/coonhound/bull arab (large) dog who has more recently decided to jump on everyone all the time (not just entering house/room). We turn our back on him until he settles down we walk toward him when he’s jumped and he doesn’t settle down… Tom: We have a lovely but sometimes boisterous staffy rescue who we've had since she was a puppy. She is 3.5 years old and is quite excitable, particularly with other dogs. We want to keep socialising her, but don't want to be those people at the dog park with the wild dog jumping everywhere. Any advice? Thanks so much for your questions! Jumping or having overexcited pups is definitely something a few of you are struggling with. I'm throwing this one over to our dog behaviour expert Laura V. Laura V: The reason dogs jump is because they are excited and have no other means of expressing this emotion. So, we need to find another way for them to get this energy out of their system, and a great way to do this is to redirect the behaviour. Identify when your dog is looking like they are thinking of jumping, and with a big handful of treats, scatter them on the floor and say 'search'. Continue to ignore your dog as they hunt for their reward with four feet on the ground, and keep them busy doing so. They will settle soon, and probably come to you sitting for another treat. Reward them for this behaviour too. The trick here is to redirect the behaviour BEFORE they jump up. If you miss that moment, turn away and walk away, or have someone put your dog on a lead so you can manage their behaviour better. The more consistent you are, the better the outcome will be.",

OPEC+ (which groups the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and allies led by Russia) has already been cutting supply to boost prices since November last year due to weaker Chinese demand and rising US supply. Despite that, it has failed to move oil prices outside a range of $US70 - $US80 a barrel. Saudi Arabia said it would extend its voluntary oil output cut of 1 million barrels per day (bpd) for another month to include August, adding that the cut could be extended beyond that month. Shortly after the Saudi announcement, Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak said Moscow would cut its oil exports by 500,000 barrels per day in August. The cuts amount to 1.5% of global supply and bring the total pledged by OPEC+ to 5.16 million bpd. OPEC+, which pumps around 40% of the world's crude oil, already has in place cuts of 3.66 million bpd. This amounts to 3.6% of global demand (including 2 million bpd agreed last year and voluntary cuts of 1.66 million bpd agreed in April and extended to December 2024). Brent crude futures were up 0.4% to $US75 a barrel.",

It also expects to spend more than $100 million in trasitional \"employment and operational costs\". The new entity will be called Scyne Advisory, and have around 1,750 ex-PwC staff. In a statement, Allegro said the new business will be \"fully independent\" of PwC. In recent months, PwC has been caught up in a damaging tax scandal. It led to eight senior partners being forced out, government departments refusing to extend their consulting contracts with the firm, and its senior management being grilled before Senate inquiries. The scandal involved a senior partner using secret information it obtained from the government (while advising it on on how to increase the tax paid by multinational companies), working out a loophole to get around them, and selling the plan to those companies, making millions of dollars in fees. Some commentors have compared PwC's conduct as simliar to a 'double agent'. \"Scyne Advisory will establish an independent Board of Directors to oversee a rigorous, ASX-standard of governance and integrity in the business,\" Allegro said. To allay concerns about the integrity of the new business, Allegro has hired former Federal Court judge Andrew Greenwood to join the board as a non-executive director. Mr Greenwood will chair an ethics subcommittee to check on the probity of employees joining Scyne Advisory, as well as future conflicts and code of conduct. Allegro said it expects the deal to be finalised by the end of August.",
