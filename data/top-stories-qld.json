Overnight, Wall Street finished lower after softer than expected retail sales data showed consumer spending is weakening. It followed a stark warning from US Treasury Secretary J anet Yellen on the US debt ceiling crisis that caused President Joe Biden to postpone his inaugural visit to Australia, saying that a recession would be likely if the US defaulted on its debt. \"Our economy would suddenly find itself in an unprecedented economic and financial storm,\" Yellen said in remarks to the Independent Community Bankers of America. \"And the resulting income shock could lead to a recession that destroys many American jobs and businesses. \"Time is running out. Every single day that Congress does not act, we are experiencing increased economic costs that could slow down the U.S. economy.\" Back home, the Australian share market is set to follow Wall Street's lead and open lower. Later this morning we'll get the latest figures on wages, which will be a key piece of data the Reserve Bank will take into account ahead of next month's interest rate decision. The wages data will also give us an indication of how far behind Australians are as inflation remains high at 7%. There's a bit to unpack, so let's crack on, shall we?",
