A week after winning the AFL Premiership, Darcy Moore told RN Breakfast host Patricia Karvelas that despite what some people thought, sport and politics could mix. \"I'll be voting yes. To me, I feel like it's an intuitive next step and seems to be an important and practical way to help Indigenous Australians,\" he said. \"There are certainly people out there that want you to shut up and play sport, but we've seen all around the country, like with Nathan Cleary, athletes are human beings and citizens of the country too, so they can exercise their right and say what they want to say and they can do it in a really healthy way. \"The argument around division … to my mind there is already advisory bodies for Indigenous Australians that have come and gone as governments have changed. The mechanism has kind of already existed anyway, so by making it sort of permanent in the constitution, it's just locking it in. So in that way it's not anything new.\" Listen to the full interview below.",
