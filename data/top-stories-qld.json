Loibl said he paid $US110,000 (about $162,500) for a dive in 2019 that fell through when the first submersible didn't survive testing. Two years later, he went on a successful voyage along with two men from England, as well as OceanGate chief executive Stockton Rush and French diver Paul-Henri Nargeolet, who are missing on the current voyage. The dive was repeatedly delayed to fix a problem with the battery and the balancing weights, Loibl said. \"I was a bit naive, looking back now,\" he said. Reporting by AP",
