The late Gumatj clan leader and former Australian of the Year passed away earlier this year at age 74. Mr Dutton was speaking at a press conference in Adelaide, where he made a link between Yunupiŋu's achievements in helping improve economic outcomes for his Yolŋu people, and how that was a reason Australia should vote against the \"Canberra-based bureaucracy\" of an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Voice to Parliament. Indigenous Australians Minister Linda Burney called for Mr Dutton to apologise, accusing him of using the late leader's \"name in vain\" and of making inaccurate references to East Arnhem Land. Yunupiŋu's brother and now-leader of the Gumatj clan Djawa Yunupiŋu released a short statement in relation to Mr Dutton's comments, via the Yothu Yindi Foundation. \"It saddens our family to see my brother's name and legacy twisted like this,\" Mr Yunupiŋu said. \"He was a strong advocate for the Voice, and Mr Dutton knows that. \"He heard the same message loud and clear when he met with the 13-clan leadership of the Dilak Council, who also support a Voice.\" Djawa Yunupiŋu and the Dilak Council offered their unequivocal support towards a Voice to Parliament at the Garma Festival in north-east Arnhem Land earlier this year.",

Khamis Elessi, who is a neuro-rehabilitation and pain medicine consultant at the Islamic University of Gaza, told ABC News Radio he felt as if he was in a scene from the Living Dead. \"As I'm talking to you there are 13 people who've been brought from under the rubble of their homes without any prior warning, so the house was demolished on top of the residents,\" he said. Other times people were left running blindly looking for shelter after being given just minutes to evacuate. \"The next morning you open your windows and you look through it and you find it's still dark — even though it's 7am or 8am — not because there is no sun but because everything is covered with a thick layer of smog and smoke and fires are still igniting in so many buildings and so many roads,” he said. “People running amongst the shrapnel, the debris … car windows broken and they are running to seek new shelter and they are crying and their faces are covered with dark black smoke, they look like they are coming from Return of the Living Dead. It's just like an action movie about zombies.\" Doctors used to treating people in pain are now struggling to treat shrapnel wounds, and devasting injuries from explosions. \"The vast majority of injuries are children, the vast majority of dead are children and next to them is women unfortunately,\" he said, adding that without sufficient medicine or equipment doctors could not save them. He said hospitals were overwhelmed and not equipped to receive \"2,000 patients a day\" with morgues full and ice-cream refrigerators being used to store the dead.",

              "plaintext": "The latest in our look at the 2023 draft class is an exciting player with a familiar name, who has rocketed up into top three calculations in recent months. Zane Duursma is a hybrid forward, tall and strong in the air and on the lead but just as deadly when the ball hits the deck. Duursma is an intelligent and skilful player who can also work his defenders over with his impressive tank. Duursma kicked a mountain of goals this year for both Vic Country and the Gippsland Power, and by the end of the season was probably the hottest player in the Coates League. He can float in and out of games, but can be absolutely devastating with only a handful of touches. He's also flagged an interest in moving into the midfield later in his career, but for the first few years at least Duursma will be a dangerous half-forward, a tough match-up for the opposition due to his wide range of abilities. The top five in this year's draft looms large for clubs on the look out for a touch of class.",
