A paramedic was also shot while inside an ambulance, the charity said. \"Hospitals are not targets and must remain safe spaces. Medical care must not be impeded,\" Doctors Without Borders said on X. \"We call on the Israeli military to stop firing on hospitals and to stop their military vehicles from blocking ambulances and medical staff from reaching health care facilities.\" Israel's military has not released a response to these claims, but said on social media that it had conducted \"counterterrorism activity\" in the Jenin refugee camp and killed multiple terrorists.",

On Thursday (local time) the city of Jenin was rocked by dozens of explosions as Israeli armoured vehicles tore through the streets, fighting running battles with Palestinian gunmen using assault rifles and pipe bombs. Four more were killed elsewhere in the West Bank on Thursday, the health ministry said, putting the toll of Palestinians killed in the West Bank since October 7 at more than 180 people. Three Israelis were killed in violence in the West Bank over that period, according to officials. On Telegram the Israel Defense Forces confirmed it had conducted an operation in Jenin, claiming it had killed more than 10 terrorists and arrested more than 20 \"wanted suspects\". However advocacy organisation Defense for Children says two of those killed in Jenin on Thursday were children. Unlike Gaza which is ruled by Hamas, the governing body in the West Bank is the Palestinian Authority. AFP/ABC",

Asked in the same interview if the ICRC had any staff fatalities, he said a colleague had been missing for weeks, without elaborating. Mr Schomburg also voiced alarm about overcrowding in cramped shelters where hundreds of thousands of Gazans have fled, especially as many thousands more flee south, hoping to avoid the brunt of Israel's ground invasion. \"It's a particularly difficult image in my mind, seeing thousands upon thousands of individuals with a look of total fear on their faces, carrying few of their possessions, some waving white flags as they moved on foot to seek greater safety and protection,\" he told Reuters. \"Unless there is a reduction in the hostilities and if humanitarian aid is able to enter at a greater rate than it currently is, then the lives of civilians will become increasingly pressurised as resources become ever more scarce,\" he said. The International Committee of the Red Cross, a neutral organisation based in Geneva, has escorted patients and freed hostages out of Gaza since the conflict began more than a month ago and is protected under international humanitarian law.",

In the three months to September 30, REA Group's adjusted earnings (or operating EBITDA) came in at $198 million — 13% higher than Q1 last financial year — while its revenue was up 12% to $341 million. \"Australia's largest residential property markets, Sydney and Melbourne, have experienced a stronger than typical winter and this strength has continued into spring,\" REA Group said in a statement to the ASX. \"Nationally, increased activity is being driven by the continuation of strong demand, supported by near record employment and immigration, and increasing supply with the return to peak prices improving seller confidence. \"The stabilisation of interest rates for several months, which ended with this week's rate rise, played a key role in building market confidence. \"This increase and any further increases in rates from current levels could have a negative impact on sentiment .\" REA Group's CEO, Owen Wilson, said the strong results were thanks to the strength in the property market and healthy demand from buyers.

The Reserve Bank has analysed the effect that a record growth in working age population (in data going back to 1979) is having on inflation, and concludes it is broadly neutral overall. \"The supply and demand effects of stronger-than-expected population growth appear to have roughly offset in aggregate, while helping to alleviate labour shortages in specific sectors, such as hospitality,\" the RBA argued. \"This has helped to contain wage pressures in some affected industries and geographic areas, though increased migration has not materially affected aggregate wages growth .\" However, if increased population growth has not greatly affected wages growth, it is unclear how it is not adding to inflation, given observations elsewhere in the RBA's statement. \"Australia's working age population rose by 2.8 per cent over the year to September; this was the strongest rate of working age population growth since this series began in February 1979,\" the report observed. \"This has supported demand conditions for Australian businesses. In particular, total spending has been supported by strong growth in international students and tourists over the past year. This includes a large contribution from Chinese tourists and students since the start of 2023, despite a slowing economic recovery in China. \" Total spending, rather than consumption, determines the demand conditions that feed into the price-setting behaviour of consumer-facing firms. \"However, an increase in international students also supports the supply side of the economy as many students participate in the labour force.\" Translated from economic jargon, more people means more demand, even if each person is cutting their individual spending, and it is this total demand that determines whether businesses can pass on cost increases, and potentially even add on a bit more profit margin. The boost to the supply side dampens inflation by ensuring an adequate supply of products and services to meet demand, but also by meaning employers do not need to further bid up the price of labour, as they would need to if workers were more scarce.",
