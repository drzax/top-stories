The Australian building materials producer, which is heavily focused on the US market, reported falling first quarter sales (-5% to $US954 million) but an increased underlying profit. The company's adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) jumped 12% to $US279 million. The reason? A massive growth in profit margins. The company's adjusted EBITDA margin jumped from 24.9 to 29.2% over the past year. Both the company's US and Asia-Pacific fiber cement divisions posted record EBIT profit margins of 31.1% and 33.1% respectively. Those margins jumped 5.4 percentage points in the US and 7.5 percentage points in the Asia-Pacific region since its first quarter results a year ago. Slumping volumes saw the company's European building products division report a decrease in earnings, with rising costs keeping margins stagnant despite a steep rise in prices. Overall, the company ended up reporting a small (-3%) fall in its statutory net profit, which came in at $US157.8 million ($240 million).",
