The biggest bank in the nation, the Commonwealth Bank, has put out its preview of next Tuesday's budget and it spells out some assumptions that will help you frame the size of the challenge facing the nation. Here's what the bank says the government is trying to do, at the same time: maintaining fiscal discipline to assist monetary policy in bringing inflation back to the 2%-3% target range providing some targeted relief to cost-of-living pressures putting in place new arrangements to reverse the projected blowout in spending on a number of large programs (ie. NDIS, Aged care) implementing the AUKUS defence policy priorities further developing climate change policies implementing some tax reform and moving the medium-term budget outlook onto a more sustainable footing And don't forget â win the next election so you can start working on the really hard stuff! That said, there's some good news for Treasurer Jim Chalmers. There was a budget last year â in October 2022 â to enact a lot of election promises. The 2022/23 budget deficit is expected to come in well below the estimate that was made then. Data to March shows the 2022/23 deficit running at $A11.2 billion \"a substantial $A23.3 billion lower than expectations\". If you roll it over 12 months like in this chart, the budget is back to a (very) small surplus â mainly thanks to the strong labour market and company profits."

The biggest bank in the nation, the Commonwealth Bank, has put out its preview of next Tuesday's budget and it spells out some assumptions that will help you frame the size of the challenge facing the nation. Here's what the bank says the government is trying to do, at the same time: maintaining fiscal discipline to assist monetary policy in bringing inflation back to the 2%-3% target range providing some targeted relief to cost-of-living pressures putting in place new arrangements to reverse the projected blowout in spending on a number of large programs (ie. NDIS, Aged care) implementing the AUKUS defence policy priorities further developing climate change policies implementing some tax reform and moving the medium-term budget outlook onto a more sustainable footing And don't forget â win the next election so you can start working on the really hard stuff! That said, there's some good news for Treasurer Jim Chalmers. There was a budget last year â in October 2022 â to enact a lot of election promises. The 2022/23 budget deficit is expected to come in well below the estimate that was made then. Data to March shows the 2022/23 deficit running at $A11.2 billion \"a substantial $A23.3 billion lower than expectations\". If you roll it over 12 months like in this chart, the budget is back to a (very) small surplus â mainly thanks to the strong labour market and company profits.",
