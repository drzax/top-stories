The late Gumatj clan leader and former Australian of the Year passed away earlier this year at age 74. Mr Dutton was speaking at a press conference in Adelaide, where he made a link between Yunupiŋu's achievements in helping improve economic outcomes for his Yolŋu people, and how that was a reason Australia should vote against the \"Canberra-based bureaucracy\" of an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Voice to Parliament. Indigenous Australians Minister Linda Burney called for Mr Dutton to apologise, accusing him of using the late leader's \"name in vain\" and of making inaccurate references to East Arnhem Land. Yunupiŋu's brother and now-leader of the Gumatj clan Djawa Yunupiŋu released a short statement in relation to Mr Dutton's comments, via the Yothu Yindi Foundation. \"It saddens our family to see my brother's name and legacy twisted like this,\" Mr Yunupiŋu said. \"He was a strong advocate for the Voice, and Mr Dutton knows that. \"He heard the same message loud and clear when he met with the 13-clan leadership of the Dilak Council, who also support a Voice.\" Djawa Yunupiŋu and the Dilak Council offered their unequivocal support towards a Voice to Parliament at the Garma Festival in north-east Arnhem Land earlier this year.",

A growing number of Australians are using digital wallets, such as Apple and Google Pay, that are loaded on a phone to pay for goods and services. About 35 per cent of card transactions in the June quarter were made using digital wallets, compared to 10 per cent in early 2020. Figures from the Reserve Bank of Australia reveal nearly two-thirds of people aged between 18 and 29 use digital payment systems on mobile phones, and the number of people over 65 using digital wallets has also tripled since 2019. Treasurer Jim Chalmers has argued that new payment systems, like digital wallets, should be regulated in the same way as credit cards, EFTPOS and other transactions.
