Is this allergies? Here's Dr Karishma 's advice: Dr Karishma: It sounds that there may be 2 things going on - both anxious behaviour and an aversion to the noise of the sizzling steak or pitter patter of the gecko's. As well as allergies from chewing at his feet! Chewing and licking at paws can initially start as a contact allergy from walking on something itchy or irritant such as grass or certain plants, then turn into a behavioural displacement behavior or habit. And they use this behaviour to help calm or soothe themselves - kind of like children sucking their thumb. It's best to get his little feet checked at the vet to ensure there is not an underlying allergy for which he needs medication prior to attributing it to behavior. Sometimes a simple cream or course of tablets can rectify the itchy feet.",

This is what Dr Karishma says: Dr Karishma: Dogs are incredibly intuitive and in tune with our sounds, smells, visual cues and emotions. It is not uncommon for them to pick up on how we are feeling and alter their behaviour when they sense that we are sad, stressed, happy, angry or excited. They can display this by trying to comfort us more through nuzzling up, trying to be close to us or simply putting a paw on our lap when upset. Or barking, doing 'zoomies' and vocalising or even singing along with us when they detect we are excited. Not all dog's will pick up on scent changes, but certainly we have been training dog's for some time to assist us with detection of drugs, weapons and more recently even in healthcare to detect onset of epileptic fits or changes in blood sugar levels. So no doubt they have the capability of detecting alterations in some of our hormones.",

How do I get him to stop barking and snarling very aggressively when people come to my house? Thanks for your question Gab and it's one others who've adopted a dog have asked about too. Here's Laura V's take: Laura V: If you are concerned that it is very distressing to him, it may be worth considering crate training him, making sure the crate is a safe place for him that he can control. This does take a lot of time and patience. You can opt for your visitors to ignore him and offer him yummy food, on the floor nearby. But in all honesty, he may have a little PTSD and will always default to reacting this way as his first option. Sometimes dogs with these anxieties benefit from different nutraceuticals which can be discussed with your vet. Your vet may also want to discuss examining your dog and assessing him for other pharmaceutical options too. It is always important to consider the world from the dog's point of view and recognise that their behaviours are a means of communicating with us. Sometimes dogs are so distressed that they cannot focus or learn new ways of dealing with their fears... and so chatting about these veterinary treatment options is worthwhile.",

OPEC+ (which groups the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and allies led by Russia) has already been cutting supply to boost prices since November last year due to weaker Chinese demand and rising US supply. Despite that, it has failed to move oil prices outside a range of $US70 - $US80 a barrel. Saudi Arabia said it would extend its voluntary oil output cut of 1 million barrels per day (bpd) for another month to include August, adding that the cut could be extended beyond that month. Shortly after the Saudi announcement, Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak said Moscow would cut its oil exports by 500,000 barrels per day in August. The cuts amount to 1.5% of global supply and bring the total pledged by OPEC+ to 5.16 million bpd. OPEC+, which pumps around 40% of the world's crude oil, already has in place cuts of 3.66 million bpd. This amounts to 3.6% of global demand (including 2 million bpd agreed last year and voluntary cuts of 1.66 million bpd agreed in April and extended to December 2024).

However, the gains were limited by looming uncertainty on whether the Reserve Bank will further lift interest rates today. By 12:05pm AEST, the ASX 200 index was flat at 7,251 points, close to its highest level in two weeks. The RBA is widely expected to hike interest rates by 25 basis points to 4.35%, though a Reuters poll of economists highlighted a divided outlook. While the latest monthly measure of consumer prices showed inflation slowed to 5.6% in May (from 6.8% in April), it was still well above the RBA's 2 - 3% target range, suggesting more monetary tightening may be required. Shares of Costa Group jumped 12.2% after the horticulture firm said it had received a $1.4 billion takeover proposal from US private equity firm Paine Schwartz Partners LLC for shares it does not already own. General insurer Suncorp slipped 0.9%. This was after it forecast a 12% jump in costs associated with catastrophe reinsurance premiums and natural hazards in the 2024 fiscal year.",

It also expects to spend more than $100 million in trasitional \"employment and operational costs\". The new entity will be called Scyne Advisory, and have around 1,750 ex-PwC staff. In a statement, Allegro said the new business will be \"fully independent\" of PwC. In recent months, PwC has been caught up in a damaging tax scandal. It led to eight senior partners being forced out, government departments refusing to extend their consulting contracts with the firm, and its senior management being grilled before Senate inquiries. The scandal involved a senior partner using secret information it obtained from the government (while advising it on on how to increase the tax paid by multinational companies), working out a loophole to get around them, and selling the plan to those companies, making millions of dollars in fees. Some commentors have compared PwC's conduct as simliar to a 'double agent'. \"Scyne Advisory will establish an independent Board of Directors to oversee a rigorous, ASX-standard of governance and integrity in the business,\" Allegro said. To allay concerns about the integrity of the new business, Allegro has hired former Federal Court judge Andrew Greenwood to join the board as a non-executive director. Mr Greenwood will chair an ethics subcommittee to check on the probity of employees joining Scyne Advisory, as well as future conflicts and code of conduct. Allegro said it expects the deal to be finalised by the end of August.",
