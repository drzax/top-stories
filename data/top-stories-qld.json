Here's his full statement: \"As a board, we acknowledge the significant reputation and customer service issues facing the group and recognise that accountability is required to restore trust. \"Qantas has gone through an incredibly difficult period since our operation was grounded during the pandemic. \"The recovery has not been easy, and mistakes were made.

              "plaintext": "Qantas has revealed that its chairman Richard Goyder will retire before the company’s annual general meeting in late 2024. The airline says a number of other board members will retire throughout the next year “in recognition of the reputational issues facing the Group and to support restoration of trust in the company”. Non-executive director Michael L'estrange will retire at this year's AGM on November 3. Jacqueline Hey and Maxine Brenner will retire when Qantas' half-year results are published in February next year. Mr Goyder has been under increasing public pressure to leave Qantas, following the departure of former chief executive Alan Joyce. The company's reputation was hurt in recent years by its poor customer service, frequently losing baggage, late-running and cancelled flights, and sharply increased airfare — while posting a record profit. Its public standing was damaged further when the competition regulator (the ACCC ) sued the airline in court for allegedly selling thousands of tickets for flights that it knew had already cancelled. In addition, the High Court rules that the airline had illegally sacked 1,700 ground handling staff, under the leadership of Mr Goyder and Mr Joyce (as chairman and CEO). In late September, Mr Goyder was grilled in a Senate inquiry, but dismissed calls for him to step down. His decision to leave by next year's annual general meeting in November 2024 (instead of next month's AGM) shows he's continuing to defy public pressure. Its share price has plummeted by more than 21% in the past three months.",

The local share share market is likley to begin its day higher, with ASX futures up 0.4%. The Australian dollar rose 0.3% to 64.3 US cents. It follows a solid day on Wall Street, with the S & P 500 and Nasdaq Composite rising 0.5% and 0.6% respectively, to their highest level in three weeks. The Dow Jones index gained 0.4%. Oil prices retreated, with Brent crude futures down 0.8% to $US87.42 per barrel. Spot gold was steady at $US1,860 an ounce. But while oil prices eased after Monday's rally, investors were still closely monitoring developments in the Middle East. US Fed driving share markets higher Worries about borrowing costs staying higher for longer subsided a little overnight. That's after the interest rate on the US government's long-term debt posted their largest daily drop since mid-July. In particular, the US 10-year Treasury yield fell 10.6 basis points (bps) to 4.68% (which is still near a 15-year high overall). The catalyst appears to be some 'dovish' comments from top-ranking Federal Reserve officials, including Fed Vice Chair Philip Jefferson. On Monday, he indicated that the recent jump in US Treasury yields (which directly influence financing costs for households and businesses) might mean the Fed doesn't need to lift its benchmark interest rate. Then on Tuesday (local time), Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank President Raphael Bostic said the central bank does not need to raise interest rates any further, and sees no recession ahead (even as the Fed's rate hikes so far slow the economy and bring down inflation).",

Rallies were held in Sydney and Melbourne over the last two nights in support of Palestinians. The president of the Zionist Federation of Australi a, Jeremy Leibler, said some of the slogans being chanted at the Sydney demonstration were unacceptable. “I’m terrified when I see these marches through the city that are not holding candles and calling for peace as we see from rallies in the Jewish community when things have flared up in the Middle East,” he told ABC Radio Melbourne. “What we’re seeing is violent protests.” Mr Leibler said the response from Australian political leaders so far has been heartening. “I think we’ve had strong, very principled support – bipartisan support – both from the prime minister, from [opposition leader] Peter Dutton, and both at the state leadership levels as well,” he said. “So there should be. As there was after 9/11.” President of the Palestine Advocacy Network, Nasser Mashni, said he was disappointed by some of the language used at the pro-Palestinian demonstrations. “It’s entirely unacceptable. There is no room in our movement for antisemitism, any level of racism, Islamophobia, whatever,” he said. “Our struggle is an anti-colonial struggle for self-determination for all peoples in the holy land.” However, he said the move to project the Israeli flag on the Sydney Opera House was hurtful for Australians with a Palestinian background. “I’m Australian too, why don’t my children matter? When the [Sydney] Opera House is lit up in the Israeli flag there was an opportunity for Australia to have a moment of bringing together all peoples to say all children matter,” he said. “Both the flags could have been there.” Meanwhile, Victoria Police is investigating reports of antisemitic threats made in South Yarra yesterday. Police said the occupants of a car threatened a man on Toorak Road about 4pm yesterday.",

Nicholas Blanford, a non-resident senior fellow with the Atlantic Council's Middle East Programs, told ABC News Radio Hezbollah was a very real and formidable threat to Israel. \"It's a very close ally of the Hamas movement, so what is going in Gaza now has a direct impact on Hezbollah,\" he said. While the two groups are different the two share many similarities especially when it comes to shared hostility towards Israel. \"In fact, the unprecedented operation Hamas conducted on Saturday breaking out of the Gaza, and entering the Israeli settlements around Gaza was straight out of Hezbollah's playbook,\" he said speaking from Beirut. \"A massive rocket barrage, infiltration on mass across the border to cause as much damage and chaos as possible inside Israel. \"Hezbollah have been training since 2007 but in this case it was Hamas which put it into practice with deadly effect.\" But he noted Hezbollah faced constraints with shots still being called by Iran, so if the group was told to go to all-out war with Israel they would. But he also said he wasn’t certain Hezbollah would want to face an all-out conflict knowing it would erode its “potent capabilities” further down the road.

              "plaintext": "Reporting by Matt Garrick Indigenous Australians Minister Linda Burney says she is \"shocked\" by comments made by the Opposition leader about late Northern Territory land rights advocate, Yunupiŋu. Gumatj clan leader and former Australian of the Year Yunupiŋu died earlier this year aged 74, after a lifetime spent trying to better the outcomes of his Yolŋu people in north-east Arnhem Land. Earlier today, Opposition Leader Peter Dutton equated Yunupiŋu's work towards improving his Arnhem Land community with why a Voice to Parliament wasn't needed. \"They've got a logging company, they've got a building company, they've got housing, they've got a functioning society … because of the leadership demonstrated by Yunupiŋu and others around him over the course of a long period, and that's what we want to see replicated elsewhere,\" he said. Mr Dutton's comments in Adelaide did not account for the fact that the East Arnhem local government area (LGA) remains one of the 10 most disadvantaged LGAs in Australia. In reaction, Ms Burney says she was \"shocked at that statement\". \"Yunupiŋu spent his entire life fighting for his people, fighting for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people across this country and also advocating a Voice to Parliament,\" she said. \"Quite frankly, Peter Dutton should apologise for taking the name of Yunupiŋu in vain. \"The idea that there isn't disadvantage in north-east Arnhem Land is patently ridiculous. \"Peter Dutton has no right at all to use the name of Yunupiŋu in that way.\" NOTE: Yunupiŋu's surname and image is used as per the wishes of his family.",
