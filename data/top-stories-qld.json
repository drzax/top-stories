Commissioner Catherine Holmes, who led the inquiry, has met the Governor General, David Hurley, at Government House in Canberra. The former Queensland chief justice handed over her three-volume report into the former government's illegal debt-raising scheme. The report is the culmination of nine weeks of public hearings and hundreds of hours of evidence. The document will now be delivered to the Attorney General, who is expected to table it in parliament later this morning. It will then be released to the public online shortly afterwards.",

In February this year, CBA committed to keeping its regional branches opening for the rest of the year, in light of hundreds of physical bank branches from closing across regional and rural Australia. CBA's retail banking services group executive Angus Sullivan said while more people are choosing to bank online or over the phone, physical banking options were still needed. \"Through this time of change we want to support customers in regional areas who prefer banking in branch and so we will maintain our existing face-to-face services in these communities,\" Mr Sullivan said. \"Today's announcement ensures CBA continues to offer the largest branch network in Australia, providing customers across the country with a wide range of flexible banking options and locations. \"We look forward to working closely with regional communities over the next three years to refine how we better support and familiarise them with all the CBA banking services available.\" CBA's decision follows a Senate inquiry into the shuttering of hundreds of bank branches across the country.
