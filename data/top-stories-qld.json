According to Live Performance Australia, from 2004 to 2019 the average Australian ticket price for a live performance grew from about $55 to almost $93. Similarly, in North America, the average ticket price to one of the top 100 tours grew from about $US90 ($140) to $US111 ($172) in 2022. In June, Reuters reported that the inflation for a live performance ticket in the US was 2.6 per cent higher than the country's inflation rate. And the Wall Street Journal reports the average resale price on resale platform SeatGeek grew from $US125 ($195) in 2019 to $US252 ($394) in 2023. Read more from Sam Nichols for The Money.",

              "plaintext": "Hello, Sam Yang here to take you through markets this Friday. All three major stock indexes on Wall Street ended higher, as did all 11 major sectors of the S & P 500. And it looks like the ASX will follow, with futures up more than 1 per cent. In the US, retail sales rose more than expected in August on higher gasoline prices, while initial claims for state unemployment benefits climbed to a seasonally adjusted 220,000 for the week ended September 9 from 217,000 the week before. Monthly producer prices for final demand rose 0.7 per cent last month, against expectations of a 0.4 per cent increase. On an annual basis, they increased 1.6 per cent compared with estimates of a 1.2 per cent rise. \"Today's economic data confirms the path toward a soft landing, but without being so hot that the Fed thinks they might need to do a couple more rate hikes,\" said Ross Mayfield, Investment Strategy Analyst at Baird. \"All together, it's pretty bullish.\" European stocks jumped to their biggest one-day percentage gain in six months, after the European Central Bank - hiking interest rates for the tenth straight time - suggested it was at the end of its monetary policy tightening cycle. The pan-European STOXX 600 rose 1.5 per cent and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.8 per cent. Oil prices surged to their highest since November as a tighter supply outlook offset demand concerns. Gold prices rebounded after an initial dip in opposition to the strengthening greenback.",

Friday, September 29 is forecast to be Brisbane airport's busiest day post-COVID, with 70,000 passengers expected to past through. Domestic travel is expected to be 6 per cent busier than the same time last year, with 1,287,000 passengers forecast to travel around the country — this is 92 per cent of pre-Covid 2019 levels.",
