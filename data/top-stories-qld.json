The US Justice Department has accused Google of exploiting its dominance of the internet search market to l ock out competitors and smother innovation, at the opening of the biggest antitrust trial in decades. Prosecutors allege Google rigged the market in its favour by paying billions of dollars to Apple and other businesses to be the default search engine on phones and web browsers. The US government's lawsuit, first filed in 2020, alleges the deals were intended to be \"exclusionary\" by Google that would deny its rivals access to search queries and clicks, and allow Google to entrench itself as the dominant search engine in the market. Government estimates suggest Google has a 90% market share in search in the US alone, and the deals mean there are billions of web queries sent Google's way every day — meaning users have less choice and there is less innovation as a result. But Google doesn't see it that way. It maintains that it hasn't violated antitrust laws, and the browser agreements were \"legitimate competition\" and didn't stop its rivals from developing their own search engines, or stop other companies from promoting them. Instead, Google argues that its product is simply better than those offered by other companies, and the makers of phones and web browsers simply set Google as their default search engine because it delivered the \"highest quality\" experience for their customers. It's the biggest antitrust trial since Microsoft was taken to court by US regulators in 1998. The trial in Washington DC is expected to last up to 10 weeks, but a ruling is unlikely until sometime in 2024 .",

Yesterday, news.com.au reported that the High Court had confirmed all of its judges were members of the Qantas Chairman's Lounge, ahead of this morning's ruling. But speaking to RN Breakfast this morning, the national secretary of the Transport Workers' Union, Michael Kaine, said the memberships were \"not an issue\" in their eyes. \"It's certainly not an issue from our perspective ,\" he said. \"We just don't think it's rational to take the position that the High Court judge, literally judges that are the most astute legal minds in our community, would be influenced by membership of the Chairman's Lounge in any decision. \"We just think it's not realistic to think that these judges would be influenced there. \"They are exercising their functions. They exercise them in an impeccable way. \"We may not agree with their decision, but it won't have anything to do with their membership at the Chairman's Lounge .\"",

Later this morning, Qantas will learn whether it's convinced the High Court it did not break the law when it sacked around 1,700 ground staff at the height of the pandemic. Earlier this year, Qantas told the High Court it had sound commercial reasons to sack the staff as it moved to outsource the jobs, in the face of a dramatic decline in the number of travellers. But the Transport Workers Union told the court Qantas sacked the workers to head off any industrial action, a move which is prohibited by the Fair Work Act. Qantas denies that was its motivation, and told the court the decision was necessary to save around $100 million a year as its business plummeted by more than 90%. The airline took the case to the High Court after l osing twice in the Federal Court, which ruled the outsourcing decision breached Fair Work laws. The final verdict will be handed down around 10am AEST.",
