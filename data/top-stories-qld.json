And that comes with some economic pros and cons. It is a public holiday in Victoria today, and then a day off for other eastern seaboard states on Monday. Last year when we had a snap one-off public holiday nationally for the Queen's death, one economist told me the total cost to the economy was $2 billion. That was due to all the services suddenly shutting down, as well as the cost to pubs and clubs to pay staff higher wages. You could infer the public holidays across the various states this weekend may have a similar cost, but then you have to consider the financial benefits of sporting weekends. Brisbane hosted both the NRL and AFL preliminary finals, which the Queensland government believes generated $10 million for its economy for just these smaller games. I haven't seen any similar claims from either the Victorian or NSW governments over their hosting of the finals this weekend. But this piece from last year claims that the AFL grand final alone in Melbourne at the MCG last year generated about $50 million in economic activity. UTS economist Tim Harcourt just reiterated that $50 million figure in an interview with Nine, and said that the NRL game has a smaller economic impact, at around $17 million. He added that the AFL impact is probably bigger because the venue it is hosted in, the MCG in Melbourne, is bigger. Which likely therefore draws in more travelling tourists, who then go spending on flights, hotels and extra partying. \"I think probably Brisbane airport is the winner,\" he added, \"because you've got the Broncos coming down for the NRL and the Lions coming down for the AFL.\" Which hints at another story: Queensland may just be the winner overall this weekend! Happy finals fever to all that celebrate.",

They talked about a whole range of things - the shift to digital banking, the future of cash, declining foot traffic, and what impact it has on communities when they lose a bank branch. My colleague Kate Ainsworth wrote a great summary of the topics they covered, which is attached in a link below. But when ANZ chief executive Shayne Elliott appeared in the afternoon, Queensland Nationals senator Matt Canavan asked him how much ANZ had contributed to the Yes campaign. Mr Elliott replied: “It’s been publicly reported that major companies like ANZ have made donations in the region of sort of $2m and we're ­certainly in that range.\" So we've asked the other major banks what their contribution has been, and here were their answers: NAB : $1.5 million. Westpac : $1.75 million Commonwealth Bank : $2 million That's $7.25 million altogether. NAB Group executive, Shaun Dooley (NAB executive sponsor for the Voice referendum), told the ABC that his bank's decision to support the Voice was made \"after listening to the perspectives of our Indigenous colleagues, customers and community partners\". “NAB is not telling anyone how to vote but wants people to be informed of the issues around the referendum when making a decision,\" he said. NAB says $1.3 million of its donation was coming through its philanthropic body NAB Foundation. A Westpac spokeswoman told the ABC that Westpac had long advocated for the constitutional recognition of Indigenous Australians. \"We support the Voice to Parliament, while respecting there will be a range of views,\" she said. \"Reflecting this support, we’ve made donations of $1.75 million to campaigns encouraging a yes vote on October 14.\" A spokesman from Commonwealth Bank said CBA had donated $2 million to Australians for Indigenous Constitutional Recognition (AICR), and it will be disclosed to the Australian Electoral Commission in line with regulatory requirements. He said CBA had a longstanding interest in improving outcomes for Indigenous communities, but it respected that among its key stakeholders there would be a diversity of views about the Voice. \"Whatever the outcome of the referendum we will remain focussed on reconciliation and on the steps CBA can take to improve outcomes for Indigenous staff, customers and communities,\" he said. But again, here's a great summary of the main banking topics that were discussed in the regional bank closure inquiry last week in Canberra:",
