(FYI the same source has a 57.3 per cent chance the Reserve Bank of Australia will pause - that number has been moving around quite a bit in the past two days) But back to the US. The research team and ANZ bank have sent through a note saying they expect the rate will remain on hold, but the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) will maintain its tightening bias. The team at ANZ think the sharp rise in bond yields reduces the need for further central bank tightening. As we all know, the rate hikes are to bring inflation down. In the US it's currently 3.7 per cent. That's still above it's target. Economists around the globe will be watching closely what the US central bank does, as well as the commentary from Chairman Jerome Powell at the conclusion of the meeting... because as the saying goes, when the US sneezes... we catch a cold.",

It's partnering with Tic:Toc - no not the social media platform - it's a digital home loan platform. It will manage the home loan application process through to settlement, which is funded by Bendigo and Adelaide Bank. Here's some of the spiel from the media release: The NRMA Home Loans standard variable interest rate for owner-occupiers is 5.83% per annum effective 23rd October 2023 (the comparison rate is 5.98% per annum). There will be a special offer for NRMA Insurance customers. NRMA Insurance CEO Julie Batch believes it's a natural transition from insurer to lender. \"We've helped Australians protect their homes for nearly 100 years and now we're extending our help to home loans. \"This is an opportunity for us to deepen our long-term relationship with existing customers and attract new customers early in the home buying process.\"",
