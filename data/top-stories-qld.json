ANZ is paying a final dividend of 94 cents per share, 81 cents of which will be partially franked at 65 per cent with 13 cents unfranked. \"This is a strong annual result, with record revenue and cash profit following several years of transformation, enabling us to continue to support our customers and improve their banking experience,\" the bank's chief executive Shayne Elliott said. \"We continued to strengthen our balance sheet and closed the year with provisions for potential credit losses higher than prior to the pandemic, and with more capital than ever before. This is critical as we enter a period of continued high interest rates, rising costs and geopolitical tensions.\" We'll have more details, analysis and market reaction to the ANZ result throughout the morning.",
