The Commonwealth Bank lifted its variable home loan rate for the fourth time in three months, on top of Reserve Bank rate increases. The CBA increased the rate on its Wealth Package home by 0.1 percentage points for new customers according to RateCity. The lowest variable rate for CBA Wealth Package customers has risen by 0.82 percentage points since March 1, while existing customers have seen their rates rise by 0.5 percentage points. The move follows the National Australia Bank lifting variable rates for some new customers yesterday. RateCity.com.au research director, Sally Tindall says the big banks are trying to boost their squeezed profit margins. “Things are looking increasingly bleak for new customers hoping to get a loan with Australia’s biggest bank.” “The rising cost of funding is putting pressure on the bank’s (CBA's) profit margins for new customers. \" CBA has decided to protect this margin, even if it means potentially missing out on new business.\"",
