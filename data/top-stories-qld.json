              "plaintext": "World stock markets slid on Wednesday and the US dollar gained for a third straight day as some investors accepted the notion that while the US Federal Reserve may have halted hiking interest rates, they will still stay higher for longer. Yields across the Treasury curve mostly fell as the auction of benchmark 10-year notes was modestly better than expected and the view that the Fed has likely ended its hiking cycle kept downward momentum in place. The dollar also has rebounded from last week's sharp selloff amid rising confidence the Fed has ended raising rates, though there is less agreement on whether a rate cut is on the horizon with inflation still above the US central bank's 2 per cent target. \"The Fed not necessarily hiking anymore might get people a little bit more excited, but does that mean that we're going to start cutting aggressively? It's too early to say that,\" said Marvin Loh, senior global macro strategist at State Street in Boston. \"A lot of the questions that we were asking that drove yields higher we're still asking,\" he said, referring to the bond rally that raised the 10-year yield above 5 per cent two weeks ago. Bond prices move inversely to their yield. Fed Chair Jerome Powell did not comment on monetary policy or the economic outlook in prepared remarks at a US central bank statistic conference. Investors have ramped up bets for Fed rate cuts next year, though when has not been resolved. Markets are pricing in an almost 50 per cent chance of a rate cut of at least 25 basis points as soon as May, according to the CME Group's FedWatch Tool, compared with about 41 per cent a week earlier. But futures also call for the Fed's overnight lending rate to remain above 5 per cent through next June. MSCI's all-country world stock index shed 0.1 per cent after last week posting its biggest weekly jump in almost a year.",
