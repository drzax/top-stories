Let's kick things off with Wall Street, which only finished trading a little while ago. All three indices closed lower for the day in response to US jobs data being much stronger than anticipated, stoking concerns that the US Federal Reserve may need to keep interest rates higher for longer. The S & P 500 closed at its lowest level since June 1, while the Dow turned negative for the year for the first time since June, and the Nasdaq had its worst day since May 31. So what did this US jobs data show? That job openings unexpectedly increased in August, which has fueled concerns about a tight labour market, ahead of its monthly jobs report coming out on Friday. As CommSec's senior market analyst Tom Piotrowski put it: \"We saw job openings surged by almost 700,000 in the last month 690,000, so that was the biggest increase in around two years ,\" he said. \"So at a time when the markets are trying to define what's happening with interest rates, when you've got this level of underlying strength in the US employment picture, it doesn't make for a case of talking about at the least rate cuts down the track. \"And it means that interest rates are likely to remain higher for longer .\" As for us on the local front, yesterday the ASX completely wiped out its gains for the year after the RBA's interest rate decision, which also stoked those higher for longer rate fears. That sour sentiment is likely to continue today when trading begins, with futures down 0.5% to 6,929 points. Let's see where the day takes us, shall we?",
