A fire at Briagolong tripled in size overnight as it continues to push towards the Princes Highway. There are three emergency warnings in place for the region. Country Fire Authority chief officer Jason Heffernan told News Breakfast the situation is continuing to change hour by hour. \"We're experiencing spot fires well ahead of the main fire front and firefighters and doing their best to try and contain that fire but it is very challenging, recorded peak wind gusts of 80 km per hour is serving to be very difficult for firefighters on the ground,\" he said.",

This shows what markets are betting in relation to Australian interest rate hikes (and cuts). The likelihood of a rate hike will increase with each succesive month, and is fully priced in by March next year (given inflation is still much too high). However, Australia's economy is expected to slow down considerably in the year ahead, with unemployment likely to rise from 3.7% towards 4.5% next year. In those circumstances, the Reserve Bank will likely encourage consumers to spend money again to stimulate the economy (the complete opposite of what's happening now)! So that's why markets are betting on a rate cut by the end of next year. But market expectations change all the time. So don't be surprised if the shape of this graph totally changes after this afternoon's RBA decision (depending on what new govenor Michele Bullock says in her post-meeting statement). If you want more detail about these rate expectations (and how it might affect property prices), here's my latest finance report:",

This comes after a 1.1% drop overnight (which is pretty steep). Last week, it briefly dropped as low as 63.3 US cents. But as you can see in this chart, the Aussie dollar is practically back to where it was in November last year: And it's mainly because of a surge in the US dollar, on expectations the Federal Reserve may not be done with its interest rate hikes. So that led to more people piling into the \"safe\" greenback, and selling off currencies like the Australian dollar (which tends to go up when investors have more of a \"risk appetite\"). As there's a chance of one more US rate increase by the end of this year, the US Dollar Index also jumped to an 11-month high. It's an index which tracks the US dollar against a basket of currencies including the euro, Swiss franc, Japanese yen, Canadian dollar, British pound, and Swedish krona:",

It looks like markets are increasingly accepting the possibility that interest rates could still rise in the coming months (which is bad for \"riskier\" assets like shares). However, the Reserve Bank is widely expected to keep its cash rate target on hold this afternoon, which will also be the first policy meeting chaired by new governor Michele Bullock. The Australian dollar also suffered heavy losses — it's down 1.1% to 63.6 US cents (near its weakest levels since November last year). That's after the US dollar jumped to an 11-month high. And that's because of a sell-off in the bond market, which has led to the US government's borrowing costs jumping to its highest level since October 2007 (around the time of the Global Financial Crisis). In particular, the US 10-year government yield climbed as high as 4.72%. (That's the return you'll get from lending your money to Uncle Sam for a decade — similar to a term deposit). Spot gold has also dropped 1.1% to $US1,827 an ounce, its lowest level in almost seven months. (Gold tends to do poorly when the US dollar rises). On oil markets, Brent crude futures plunged 1.8% to a three-week low of $US90.56 a barrel, as traders took advantage of a recent surge and cashed out. European stock markets also did poorly, with the Stoxx 600 index down 1%. Meanwhile, Wall Street fared better than everything else, with the Dow Jones down 0.2%, while the S & P 500 was flat, and the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.7%. This promises to be a very interesting day on markets. Stay tuned!",
