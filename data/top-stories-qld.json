                "plaintext": "Liquor & Gaming NSW has issued a press release this morning. It says wagering giant Tabcorp Holdings Limited has been convicted and fined $15,000 for offering an inducement to people without a TAB betting account. It refers to a matter that was heard in the Downing Centre Local Court in Sydney last Friday, September 22. Here's the bulk of the release: The magistrate found Tabcorp advertised a promotion via its website which included an inducement to participate in a gambling activity. In New South Wales, it is an offence to publish or communicate inducement advertisements to non-account holders. As a result of an internal failing, Tabcorp inadvertently caused its website to communicate a gambling inducement to non-account holders, which is an offence in NSW. The Liquor & Gaming NSW executive director regulatory operations, Jane Lin, said the regulator will continue to take a zero-tolerance approach to the publication of illegal gambling inducements. \"Tabcorp is a large corporation and it is our expectation that an operator of this scale has strong internal controls and demonstrates greater vigilance to prevent members of the public being exposed to gambling inducements,\" Ms Lin said. \"In many cases gambling promotions can be legally offered to betting account holders who, unlike the general public, have made a conscious decision to open an account and have expressly consented to receive this information. \"However, wagering operators can't advertise or promote inducements such as offers of increased odds or bonus bets to entice people to open a betting account or to gamble more frequently.\" NSW bans the advertisement of any offer of an inducement to participate in a gambling activity, including an inducement to bet more frequently. It is also prohibited to offer any inducements to open betting accounts, refer friends to open betting accounts, keep a betting account open or consent to receive gambling advertising.",
