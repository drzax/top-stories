ID Tours Limited and Tauranga Tourism Services were local agents that formed part of the supply chain between tourists from the Ovation of the Seas cruise ship and White Island. They were among the 13 parties charged with breaches of New Zealand's workplace health and safety laws after 22 people died when Whakaari erupted in December 2019. Last week, the two companies applied to have charges against them dismissed and today Judge Evangelos Thomas granted that application. “Neither Tauranga Tourism nor ID Tours had workers on Whakaari, it was never their workplace, they did not influence or direct the workers of the tour operators in the carrying out of their work,” he said while delivering his ruling in Auckland. Also last week, the owners of the volcano Peter, Andrew and Peter Buttle had charges against them dismissed. Their company Whakaari Management Limited is the only party that remains on trial. Five other defendants pleaded guilty before the trial began and a sixth had charges dismissed.",

Teams from across Europe had rushed to Morca cave in southern Türkiye’s Taurus Mountains to aid Mark Dickey, a 40-year-old experienced caver who became seriously ill on September 2 with stomach bleeding. He was on an expedition to map the cave, which is the country’s third deepest. Mr Dickey was too frail to climb out himself, so rescuers carried him with the help of a stretcher, making frequent stops at temporary camps set up along the way. “Mark Dickey is out of the Morca cave. He is fine and is being tended to by emergency medical worker in the encampment above,” said a statement by the speleological federation on Monday. \"Thus, the cave rescue part of the operation has ended successfully. We congratulate all those who have contributed!” AP",

The move comes after Liontown accepted a $6.6 billion takeover bid from global lithium giant Albemarle. There was speculation last week that Hancock would launch a rival takeover bid for Liontown. Hancock told the ASX that it had become a substantial shareholder in Liontown, lifting its 4.9 per cent stake to 7.72 per cent. And it says may seek a seat on the Liontown board. In a statement Hancock Prospecting said: \"This shareholding provides Hancock with a strategic stake in Liontown, giving Liontown the opportunity to leverage Hancock's expertise where it is of value to support the (Kathleen Valley lithium) project's development and subsequent operations.\" \"Hancock can contribute to Liontown's future direction alongside other Liontown shareholders, including in relation to potential investment opportunities for downstream value add in West Australia.\" The move is Ms Rinehart's biggest investment in lithium so far. She has stakes in Vulcan Energy and Delta Lithium, and a lithium joint venture with Indian miner NMDC.",
