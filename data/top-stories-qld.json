Given this and other changes, we are reviewing the structure of this document. The Board, rather than just the Governor, will be the signatory to the Statement on the Conduct of Monetary Policy, which is the document that records the common understanding on monetary policy between the RBA and the Australian Government. The new Statement is expected to be finalised later this year. The Board will oversee the Bank’s research agenda as it relates to monetary policy and aspects of financial stability. The Bank will continue with its current approach to climate change analysis, focusing on the implications of climate change for the economy, inflation and the financial system. The Board will work with the Treasury to undertake five-yearly open and transparent reviews of the monetary policy framework.",

Four of those meetings will be held on the first Tuesday of February, May, August and November, with the other four held midway between those.
