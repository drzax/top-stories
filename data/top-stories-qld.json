              "plaintext": "Israel's defence force has made a statement denying responsibility for the explosion at al-Ahli hospital that has killed hundreds of displaced Gazans. Hamas has claimed it was caused by an Israeli air strike and Israel blamed a rocket that was misfired by the Islamic Jihad militant group. Israel also said there was \"no direct hit to the hospital itself\". Spokesman Daniel Hagari said the IDF had investigated the blast. \"The IDF â¦ has confirmed that the Islamic Jihad was responsible for the strike,\" he told reporters. \"At 6:15pm a barrage of rockets was fired by Hamas to Israel. Then, at 6:59pm a barrage of around 10 rockets was fired by Islamic Jihad from a nearby cemetery. It was at the time, 6:59pm, when there were reports of an explosion at al-Ahli al-Mamdani hospital in Gaza City. \"Analysis of our aerial footage confirms there was no direct hit to the hospital itself. The only location damage is outside the hospital in the parking lot where we can see signs of burning â¦ no cratering, and no structural damage to nearby buildings.\" Rear Admiral Hagari played a recording of what was described as \"communication between terrorists talking about rockets misfiring\" that, he said, \"made specific reference\" to the hospital. The IDF claims have not been independently verified. Earlier, US President Joe Biden said he had directed his national security team to gather information about the cause of the blast. Hagari said \"trajectory analysis\" showed rockets being fired close to the hospital, and that Israel's investigation was based on \"intelligence, operational systems and aerial footage, all of which we cross checked\". Asked how an Islamic Jihad rocket could cause so much death and destruction, the IDF blamed the rocket's fuel. \"Due to the rocket flight it was very, very short because the launch has failed,\" Rear Admiral Hagari said. \"The existence of propellant made a larger explosion than the warhead itself.\"",
