He said the Yes vote would start low on that basis, but then rise. \"What we will be watching for on the night is when does this stop rising, and I would expect with about 10 per cent of the votes counted in each state, the trend will solidify by that point,\" Mr Green told Background Briefing. He said he would be watching for the trend in the cities when those votes come in, with polling showing the Yes vote was higher in inner cities than the outer suburbs. \"No state will vote 'Yes' unless the capital city votes 'Yes', so we will be waiting for a good sample of votes from cities like Sydney and Melbourne, and then looking at where they are from in those two cities\" he said. \"If the result is as clear cut as some of the polls, then we should have a very early call in most states. \"I would say say one hour after the close of counting in each state, unless its close, we should be able to call each state.\"",

One of the arguments being put forward by the No campaign is that First Nations people already have a voice. No campaign group Fair Australia singles out the little known government agency, the National Indigenous Australians Agency (NIAA), as an existing voice. \"Indigenous Australians already have a voice through the NIAA,\" said No campaigner Damien Pace while handing out \"Vote No\" pamphlets in the inner-city suburb of Ultimo last week. The NIAA carries out government policy funding and implementing programs to improve the lives of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people around the country. Like any public service department or agency, it does provide advice to government, but that is not its main role. Yes23 co-chair Arrernte and Kalkadoon woman Rachel Perkins says it's a \"myth\" that the NIAA is a voice. Constitutional expert, Professor Cheryl Saunders from the University of Melbourne, agrees that the NIAA is not a voice to parliament. \"It's a completely different body to the Voice,\" she told the ABC. \"It doesn't give advice to the parliament, it's a body that advises government.\" Read more below:",

Mr Mundine maintained the country did not need to have a referendum in the first place and the money could have been better spent on education, employment and housing. He said after the referendum, he would work with campaigners from the Yes side to fix the struggles Aboriginal people face.",
