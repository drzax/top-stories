United Malt Group told the ASX this morning they'd entered into a scheme implementation deed with Malteries Soufflet, in a deal that values United Malt at a staggering $1.5 billion. Directors of United Malt have unanimously recommended that shareholders vote in favour of the takeover at the scheme meeting. United Malt says the offer by Malteries Soufflet will see each shareholder receive $5.00 per United Malt share in cash — which is equivalent to a 45.3% premium to the company's closing share price on March 24 this year. Malteries Soufflet is a branch of the French agribusiness giant InVivo, and the deal will likely see the creation of the world's top malt producer. United Malt is the world's fourth-largest commercial maltster, and produces malt for brewers, craft brewers, distillers and food companies, and has processing plants in Australian, Canada, the US and Britain.",
