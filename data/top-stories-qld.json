The Labor Department's Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) showed 2.3 per cent of non-farm payroll workers quit their jobs in July, down from a rate as high as 3 per cent during the pandemic-driven \"Great Resignation\". The reading was the lowest since January 2021, when a wave of resignations was developing, and comparable to what was seen through 2018 and 2019 when a tight job market and low inflation coexisted. The hiring rate last month hit its lowest point since April 2020. Combined, the two data points suggested a drop in labor demand and an easing of hiring conditions, something the US central bank feels is necessary to continue lowering inflation and easing the pressure for wage hikes. The hope among policymakers is for that adjustment to happen without the sharp rise in unemployment that has accompanied prior Fed efforts to tame inflation with interest rate increases meant to slow the economy.",
