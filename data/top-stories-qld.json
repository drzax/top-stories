Led by the Palestinian Action Group, dozens of people are chanting \"free free Palestine\" and \"Palestine will never die\". Organisers told the crowd to be \"disciplined\" and that anti-Semitic chants, the lighting of flares or burning of flags would not be tolerated. Young children and older people alike are waving Palestinian flags and holding placards with words and photographs in support of Gaza. Organisers of the protest are criticising the federal government, claiming it has failed to support Palestinians and other Indigenous people around the world. The protest was authorised late on Friday, after a week of controversy following previous rallies resulting in some arrests.",
