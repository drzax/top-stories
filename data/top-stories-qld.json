She told The World Today the fact the conduct occurred for 10 years was concerning. \"What we're concerned [with] here, we've got the largest superfund in the country,\" she said. \"This conduct went for a period of about 10 years, 90,000 members affected and $69 million is being remediated. \"These obligations have been in place since 2013. And yes, we at ASIC have been calling on the superannuation industry to make sure that they do have the right processes and systems in place to meet these obligations.\" But Ms Court declined to say how big a penalty ASIC was seeking over the issue, but expects it to be substantial. \"It's an early stage ... I think, suffice to say, there is the potential for very significant penalties to be imposed in relation to this conduct,\" she said. \"But that is down the track and we will wait and see where we get to in the court proceedings.\"",
