The local share market is likely to open higher, with ASX futures suggesting a 0.3% rise in morning trade. It comes after a strong finish on Wall Street last Friday (US time), which saw the Dow Jones, S & P 500 and Nasdaq Composite rise 0.5%, 1% and 1.9% respectively. In economic news, the key event is tomorrow's Reserve Bank board meeting. Markets are betting the likelihood of of an interest rate hike is around 20%, according to Refinitiv data. However, economists from Westpac, Commonwealth Bank and other places are predicting the RBA will (more likely than not) lift its cash rate target. If the RBA keeps rates on hold, it would mean the cash rate remains at a decade high of 4.1% .",
