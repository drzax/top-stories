The cyclone made landfall on Sunday afternoon in Myanmar's Rakhine state near Sittwe township, with winds of up to 209 kilometers per hour, Myanmar's Meteorological Department says —making the storm a dangerous category five cyclone. The extent of the damage in Sittwe isn't clear just yet. Earlier yesterday, high winds crumpled mobile phone towers, cutting off communications in much of the area. In videos collected by local media before communications were cut off, deep water races through streets while wind lashes trees and pulls boards off roofs. Myanmar's military information office says the storm damaged houses, electrical transformers, phone towers, boats and lampposts in Sittwe, Kyaukpyu, and Gwa townships. It says the storm also tore roofs off of sport buildings on the Coco Islands.",
