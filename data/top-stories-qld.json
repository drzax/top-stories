              "plaintext": "At least 19 people have been killed in an Israeli air strike on a house near a hospital in north Gaza's Jabalia refugee camp, the enclave's interior ministry said. There was no immediate Israeli comment or details from the scene of the reported attack, which if confirmed would be the third on Gaza's largest refugee camp in a week. Israeli air strikes devastated parts of the camp on October 31 and November 1, flattening multi-storey dwellings in a densely populated area in Gaza's urban heartland, and Palestinian authorities said at least 195 civilians were killed. Israel said its air attacks on Jabalia last week killed two Hamas commanders and a number of militants while targeting operational tunnels dug beneath civilian districts. Thousands of Palestinian civilians fled the north during a four-hour window of opportunity announced by Israel that it says is to avoid residents being trapped in the violence. But the central and southern parts of the small, besieged Palestinian enclave also came under fire again. Palestinian health officials said an air strike that hit houses in the Nusseirat refugee camp killed 18 people on Wednesday morning. In Khan Younis, six people, including a young girl, were killed in an air strike. The Israeli military said its forces had advanced into the heart of Gaza city, Hamas's main bastion in the territory, while the Islamist group said its fighters had inflicted heavy losses. Palestinian officials said 10,569 people had been killed, 40 per cent of them children. Israel struck at Gaza in response to a cross-border Hamas raid on southern Israel on October 7 in which gunmen killed 1,400 people, mostly civilians, and took about 240 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.

Speaking of the humanitarian aid that has been delivered through Rafah, Mr Turk said: \" The lifeline has been unjustly, outrageously thin .\" \"I call â as a matter of urgency â for the parties now to agree a ceasefire,\" Mr Turk said. He added that there are three human rights imperatives: the delivery of sufficient humanitarian aid to Gaza, the release of hostages and to \"implement a durable end to the occupation\". \"We have fallen off a precipice and this cannot continue,\" he said. \"Actions of one party do not absolve the actions of the other party. \"Even in the context of a 56-year occupation, the situation is the most dangerous we have faced for people in Gaza, in Israel, in the West Bank but also regionally.\" Reporting with Reuters",

The bank reported higher earnings on deposits and capital against the backdrop of a high interest rate environment, which has in recent times allowed Australian lenders to widen their margins and capitalise on higher borrowing costs. Net interest margin, a closely watched measure that shows the amount banks take in interest payments minus operating costs, rose 9 basis points to 1.74 per cent on an adjusted basis. NAB's cash profit came in at $7.73 billion for the year ended September 30, compared with $7.10 billion a year earlier. Analysts had expected a profit of $7.80 billion, according to Visible Alpha estimates compiled by Citi. The bank declared a final dividend of 84 Australian cents per share, up from 78 Australian cents apiece a year earlier.",

Yields across the Treasury curve mostly fell as the auction of benchmark 10-year notes was modestly better than expected and the view that the Fed has likely ended its hiking cycle kept downward momentum in place. The dollar also has rebounded from last week's sharp selloff amid rising confidence the Fed has ended raising rates, though there is less agreement on whether a rate cut is on the horizon with inflation still above the US central bank's 2 per cent target. \"The Fed not necessarily hiking anymore might get people a little bit more excited, but does that mean that we're going to start cutting aggressively? It's too early to say that,\" said Marvin Loh, senior global macro strategist at State Street in Boston. \"A lot of the questions that we were asking that drove yields higher we're still asking,\" he said, referring to the bond rally that raised the 10-year yield above 5 per cent two weeks ago. Bond prices move inversely to their yield. Fed Chair Jerome Powell did not comment on monetary policy or the economic outlook in prepared remarks at a US central bank statistic conference. Investors have ramped up bets for Fed rate cuts next year, though when has not been resolved. Markets are pricing in an almost 50 per cent chance of a rate cut of at least 25 basis points as soon as May, according to the CME Group's FedWatch Tool, compared with about 41 per cent a week earlier. But futures also call for the Fed's overnight lending rate to remain above 5 per cent through next June. MSCI's all-country world stock index shed 0.1 per cent after last week posting its biggest weekly jump in almost a year.",
