The impairment comes from increased debt costs and \"tightening market conditions\" for its cleaning and maintenance business Spotless, which caters to the defence sector. Downer EDI lowered its forecasts after lawsuits were filed alleging breaches of disclosures regarding a maintenance contract and the Sydney-based company revealed accounting irregularities in December. \"Downer is undergoing a period of significant and necessary organisational change. Against this backdrop, we have delivered underlying earnings in line with what was previously communicated,\" CEO Peter Tompkins said in a statement.

Australian Strategic Materials (ASM), which owns deposits in New South Wales (though is yet to mine anything and sources its rare earths ore from other miners in Asia), has signed a deal with USA Rare Earth. ASM owns a rare earths processing plant in South Korea — that arm of the business has signed a five-year deal with the US company to supply neodymium iron boron alloy from 2024. Neodymium is used to make permanent magnets for things like medical imaging machines, engines and communications technology. It's shares are up more than 5 per cent. Liontown Resources, which mines lithium (another critical component in batteries) in the Goldfields region of WA, announced today it will export lithium direct shipping ore (DSO) (the least refined product) before it exports its first concentrate (ore that's been partly refined) as way to raise some cash. Liontown has so far stockpiled 70,000 tonnes of DSO and expects to sell up to 300,000 tonnes, likely starting by the end of this calendar year. Liontown's m anaging director and CEO, Tony Ottaviano, said: \"Progressing with the production of DSO not only provides early revenue potential, but also enables us to de-risk the project by field testing our ore sorting and logistics solutions on a smaller scale ahead of first concentrate production mid-2024.\" Liontown shares are up 0.2 per cent .",
