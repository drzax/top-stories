It might be hard to believe that an electricity and gas company could possibly lose money given current power bills, but that's exactly what AGL did last year. It's reported a $1, 264 million net statutory loss for financial year 2023, which just ended on June 30. How did it lose so much money? There's two main reasons: It wrote down the value of its coal power plants by $680 million after deciding to close some of them earlier than previously planned. It lost $890 million from the value of various financial instruments, mostly futures contracts for electricity, after government intervention and market forces caused the wholesale price of power to drop dramatically late last year. AGL was stuck with contracts that were above the new market pricing. Excluding those write-downs, AGL's underlying net profit after tax was $281 million, up 25%. And if you think that still sounds small in a sector where retail prices have just jumped by around 20-30%, then don't worry, AGL is about to make up for it. It has reiterated its forecasts for an underlying net profit of between $580 and $780 million for the current 2024 financial year. That is somewhere between double and nearly triple this year's profit. As a 'gentailer' — a power generator who also retails to customers — AGL is benefitting from \"sustained periods of higher wholesale electricity pricing\" and expected improved power plant availability, with less forced outages. However, it says inflation, difficulty collecting debts of some customers and increased maintenance spend will cap profit growth. This blog covered AGL's June announcement about its updated profit forecasts, below.",
