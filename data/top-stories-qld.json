Glenn McGrath has been blowing up in the TMS commentary box, even going as far as saying that \"If that's England taking that catch, that is out\". Michael Vaughan, perhaps tongue in cheek, is saying that \"rules are rules\". \"I'll be honest with you, I thought he caught it,\" Vaughan says. \"But I saw the message from Marais Erasmus and he was in control of the ball but not of his body. \"Rules are rules. Sorry, Glenn!\" As for \"not in control of his body\", I have no idea what that means. And I hope that someone will explain it who is less sleep deprived in the coming hours so I can try and get my head around it later on today. Because that, for Australian fans, is when the fifth and final day of this intriguing Test gets underway. In theory, it's all still to play for. Australia are still by far the favourites - they're two wickets away from a great big tail - but England will desperately want to believe that they can somehow salvage something after doing their best to throw the Test away.",

I'm not sure I can either! Starc has caught the ball and then slid with it on the ground. He has clearly caught the ball before putting it on the ground. And it's given as not out?

Extraordinary. \"That is the biggest load of rubbish that I've ever seen,\" Glenn McGrath says on ABC Sport. \"If that's not out, every catch I've ever seen taken should not be out. \"That is a disgrace.
