ICAC has rejected Ms Berejiklian's submission, and found she substantially breached the ministerial code by failing in her duty \"to act honestly and in the public interest,\" in her conduct regarding the Riverina Conservatorium of Music grant. The Commission also found Ms Berejiklian engaged in corrupt conduct when promising, or awarding grant money to the Australian Clay Target Association, without disclosing her close personal relationship with Mr Maguire.",

They say base metal and iron ore prices finished mostly lower overnight on demand concerns in China. Industrial profits in China fell by 12.6%/yr in May, confirming fears that China’s commodity intensive economy is still facing headwinds. They say the fall in industrial profits over January to May (-18.8%/yr) is rivalling the decline experienced in 2020 over the same period (-19.3%/yr). They've produced this graph to show what they mean: They say the 2020 numbers were adversely impacted by China’s nationwide COVID-19 lockdowns, so the fact that the first five months of 2023 and 2020 are showing comparable declines in industrial profits show the beleaguered state of China’s commodity-intensive economy right now.",
