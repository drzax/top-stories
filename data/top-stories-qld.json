Economists are predicting the economy will have flatlined from April to June with economic growth predicted to expand by just 0.3 per cent over the quarter, and by 1.8 per cent from a year ago. The Reserve Bank expects the Australian economy to grow by just over 1 per cent this year. Mr Chalmers has told RN Breakfast that the global economy is in an uncertain place and China is slowing down. \"We've seen, particularly in their property sector but also in relation to their retail and in relation to their exports, that the Chinese economy has been slowing quite considerably.\" \"And that's obviously important to us.\" Mr Chalmers says the combination of China's slowdown and higher interest rates are putting pressure on the Australian economy. \"The challenges to our economy are substantial.\" But Mr Chalmers maintained the government's view that Australia is expected to avoid a recession. Have a listen to the interview on RN Breakfast this morning.",
