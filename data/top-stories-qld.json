The same journalist told the BBC that Israeli soldiers threw a smoke bomb before storming in and entering the hospital's specialised surgical department. Dr Munir al-Bursh, director-general of the Gaza health ministry, told Al Jazeera television that Israeli forces had raided the western side of the medical complex. \"There are big explosions and dust entered the areas where we are. We believe an explosion occurred inside the hospital,\" Dr Bursh said. Israel Defense Forces earlier said it was carrying out a \"precise and targeted operation\" in Al-Shifa.

Israel could also face massive international backlash if they do not find evidence of Hamas tunnels under the hospital, says Lyons. He equates it to the \"moment of truth in the information war\", adding if Israel does find evidence, \"every person in the world will be made aware of that\". \"The Israelis will want to get those pictures right around the world,\" Lyons says. \"But if there are not, Israel has some really tough questions to answer. \"1,000 or so children and babies being killed every week in this war. \"Israel is saying some of that has been unavoidable because Hamas has been using civilians to embed themselves. \"If they find nothing in the hospital, then a lot of the basis of that argument falls and I think there will be a major backlash against Israel.\" Watch the full video here:",

              "plaintext": "The push to legalise cannabis for recreational use in Australia just got another boost from a former AFP chief commissioner. At a speech in Melbourne, Mick Palmer AO said cannabis law reform would lead to less discrimination and spending on enforcement. The retired police officer spent many years in the field, including in the Northern Territory, where he says he saw many examples of Indigenous Australians being discriminated against, under laws that once banned them from drinking alcohol. He reminded people listening in the crowd that homosexual acts and suicide had also once been illegal. \"Police, too often, in my view, are seen as a ‘cure all’,\" he said. \"The cadre of people most in need of support, treatment and protection are those most likely to be punished. \"There has to be a better, more effective, less damaging way to deal with people who use cannabis, than simply arresting them.\" Palmer was sworn is as the top police officer in the country in 1994 and, during his reign as AFP commissioner, conducted the Palmer Inquiry into the unlawful detention of Australian citizen, Cornelia Rau. He made this speech for one of Australia's most renowned authorities on drug reform. The Penington Institute recently changed its position on cannabis legalisation, and now argues that it should be made lawful in \"a strictly regulated market that prioritises safety and health outcomes\". \"On the basis of long and painful legislative history lessons, it is a position that is hard to argue against,\" Mr Palmer said. \"To do so I suggest, would go a long way towards leaving a truly courageous legacy.\" The former AFP commissioner's comments come just days after ABC News published a story into the growing push to nationally legalise Australia's most commonly consumed illicit substance. The Greens say legalisation could lead to an economic boom, and medicinal marijuana companies agree, although they are in dispute with the Greens about the best way to achieve this.",

The ASX 200 rose 1.6% to 7,121, by 12:23pm AEDT, its highest level since September 21. The benchmark was also on track for its biggest daily jump since July 13. Rate-pause bets got a boost as data on Tuesday showed US consumer prices were unchanged in October, while underlying inflation rose at the smallest annual pace in two years. In Australia, data showed third-quarter wage price index (seasonally adjusted) rose 4% annually, compared with 3.9% growth expected by a Reuters Poll. Gold stocks soared 3.4% to post their biggest intraday jump since January 4. Northern Star Resources advanced 4% and Evolution Mining surged 4.3%. ASX-listed shares of Newmont Corp rose 3.7%. Miners also climbed 3% to hit a 2-month high, drawing strength from higher iron ore prices as China's stimulus measures for its steel-heavy property sector lifted demand outlook. Rio Tinto jumped 3.4% and BHP Group advanced 2.2%. Rate-sensitive financial stocks extended gains, adding 0.5% and set for their sharpest climb since November 3. Meanwhile, energy stocks bucked the trend, falling by 0.1% as oil prices pared gains on signs tensions in the Middle East could be easing and uncertainty about US oil inventories. Heavyweights Santos fell 0.6%, while Woodside Energy was flat. Leading gains on the benchmark, Centuria Capital Group jumped 11% after the specialist investment manager secured $500 million institutional industrial funding.",
