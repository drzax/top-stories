              "plaintext": "Suncorp reported a 69% jump in full-year profit, yet it's one of today's worst-performing stocks. By 12:45pm AEST, its share price was down 2.1% to $13.46. In its results announcement, the insurer warned of challenges posed by high inflation and the financial impact of adverse weather events (ie. natural disasters). Suncorp's lower-than-expected dividend also weighed on its share price. Australia's second-largest insurer announced a fully-franked final dividend of 27 cents per share (which was lower than consensus estimate of 40 cents, and Citi's estimates of 39 cents). \"The operating environment remains challenging,\" Suncorp said, forecasting an insurance gross written premium growth of around 10% in fiscal year 2024 (compared with a 10.8% growth seen in previous year for combined Australia and New Zealand units). \"The dividend will likely disappoint some and the guidance, while largely as expected, suggests a relatively tough 1H24 with the lingering issues in motor inflation we expected,\" analysts at Citi wrote in a research note. Lower end of shareholder payout, higher costs ahead Suncorp's full-year dividend payout ratio was 60% of its cash earnings, at the lower end of its range of 60% to 80%. Analysts at Citi said they believed the ordinary payout reflects a significant drain on the capital of the company. Suncorp posted annual cash earnings of $1.25 billion, compared with $673 million a year earlier, helped by improved underlying margins and a significant turnaround in investment returns. Net gain from yields and investment markets was $724 million for the year, compared with a loss of $190 million in 2022, the company said in a statement. The insurer also flagged an increase in costs related to the $4.9 billion divestment of banking unit to ANZ Group to between $575 million and $600 million (up from $500 million) after the ACCC blocked the deal. - Reuters",

Mathrani was hired in 2020 and tasked with the company's turnaround amid rising investor concerns over corporate governance standards.

The fashion firm was founded by sisters Nicky and Simone Zimmerman in 1991 and grew into a globally recognised brand. Reuters reported the deal valued the brand at about $1.8 billion. Zimmermann has revenue of around $US260 million and a more than 30 per cent core profit margin. The sisters will retain a minority stake along with Italian private equity investor Style Capital, and will continue to run the company with the current management. Zimmermann has 58 stores across Australia, the US, UK, Europe and China. Advent International says the deal will allow Zimmermann to expand into new luxury markets, including in Asia and Europe, and ramp up its distribution network including online. Advent has investments in brands including high-end perfume brands Parfums de Marly and INITIO Parfums Prives, cosmetics brand owner Orveon, and Lululemon Athletica, which sells athletic and yoga wear. Here's Advent International managing partner Ranjan Sen: “Zimmermann presents a rare and exciting opportunity to acquire a fast-growing iconic luxury fashion brand with significant potential for further expansion. \" \"The Zimmermann team have successfully created a distinctive and desirable global luxury brand, which has built a loyal customer base around the world.\" Co-founder Nicky Zimmermann says she is excited about further expansion. \"There are so many exciting opportunities for Zimmermann ahead and Simone and I feel extremely fortunate to be going on this journey with our team, one that started nearly 30 years ago at Paddington Markets in Sydney. \" \"We look forward to working collaboratively with our new partners to achieve our shared ambitions for the brand, with our loyal clients at the centre of that vision.”",
