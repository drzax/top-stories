So I suppose one might say that it will be our turn for a little while.  If one looks at Australia’s interest rates over the last 40 years, interest rates have rarely been below 5% pa. - Miles. I have complete sympathy for you Miles. In the inflation-targeting era (since the early 1990s), interest rates have been in long-term decline - except for now. It's been increasingly great for asset owners. But people who rely on interest rates from their savings to supplement their income have not benefited."

But if this in not immediately countered by a tax hit to middle/high and home owning households the net impact on the economy (i.e. demand) is clearly going to be positive.  Completely at odds with what the RBA is trying to acheive...\n - Mike. There's a good point in here. Governments have got off too lightly for contributing to this inflation. The RBA has become a scapegoat of sorts. Your point about the budget is also interesting. There are credible forecasts at the moment that the Albanese Government could actually deliver an exceptionally-thin budget surplus next week. That's for a few reasons, but especially because commodity prices have been far higher than Treasury was forecasting, and because the exceptionally-high levels of immigration we're seeing out the moment are much higher than were forecast. And budget surpluses help to suck inflation out of the system. So on the surface, the budget settings look like they may be supporting the RBA's attempt to dampen inflation. But that's only on the surface. The budget will probably show that there will be a heap of structural problems down the line that will be hard to address."

It can only influence demand (in the short and medium term) by moving interest rates up and down. That's why the RBA is always keeping an eye on wages because wages feed into demand-driven inflation. This is just the system past policymakers built. In the inflation-targeting era, it's been the RBA's job to manage inflation - and the economic cycle - by moving interest rates around to influence demand ."

                  "articleBody": "Hi just wondering if there is any historical data that's shows how high previous inflation rates were when they actually triggered a recession or a recessionary curve. As a baby boomer who lived through interest rates of 12% and higher 30 years ago, current inflation seems not high at all - Bill. A significant difference with today's environment, compared to past eras, is the level of debt in the economy. When my folks bought their first home in the early 1970s it cost them $35,000. That was 3x their annual income. Today, properties are typically worth upwards of 7x annual income, and well above 10x to 12x in some of our capital cities. And because the cash rate was 0.1% for a time, the size of the recent mortgages banks were willing to extend to people were huge. So, relatively small increases in interest rates are much more impactful today. Now, this might be a slightly left-field way of answering your question quickly, but I recently made a graph of the time when Australia's economic authorities experimented with targeting the money supply to control inflation (at the peak of Milton Friedman's monetarism craze in the late 1970s and early 1980s). It was when Malcolm Fraser was prime minister and John Howard was Treasurer (for most of the time). There were three recessions in that period, including the recession in the early 1980s which was especially bad. It shows how high inflation was in that era. Note inflation fell after each recession. Although, inflation shot up again in 1985, after the Hawke Government floated the dollar in 1983 and deregulated the financial sector."

                  "articleBody": "Alan Oster, NAB's chief economist, says he's finding it difficult to understand the RBA board's behaviour lately. He spoke to my colleague David Chau earlier, and he had this to say about today's rate hike and the accompanying statement from governor Phil Lowe. Q: \"Recent property market data for Canberra showed house prices are on their way up again. Is the wealth effect something the RBA may be concerned about? Especially if house prices continue their recovery? People might feel they are better off economically and might spend more, which might make it harder for the Reserve Bank to bring inflation down? Alan Oster: \"That is possible. But let's face it. It is mainly a Sydney thing. Up over 1% in Sydney and across Australia, 0.5%. \"Yes, there is a wealth effect associated, but also a very direct interest-rate effect. It is much bigger than the wealth effect. The nice news is these are probably bottoming out. But the fact that the economy is still going to slow I think is an issue. \"Once again the Reserve Bank made it very difficult for us all to understand what the hell they are talking about, to be brutally honest,\" he said."

Economists say it would be reasonable to expect rates to rise a little more this year, but I haven't seen anyone suggest that rates will keep rising until mid-2025. There are still hundreds of thousands of households with fixed-rate mortgages that have yet to roll onto variable loans. When they do, they'll be getting a big interest rate shock. The RBA's aware of that. It knows there's a lag between rate hikes and their impact on economic activity, and it's expecting inflation to slowly fall over the next 24 months as the rate rises that have already occurred work their way through the system."

They have no control over supply. So when they move interest rates up and down, they're trying to manipulate demand. Wages are one of the key drivers of demand, and employment (and unemployment) drives wages. The RBA knows this inflationary episode didn't start with exceptionally-strong wages growth. But it's very concerned that workers will demand (and start winning) wage growth to match this high inflation because that could spark a \"wage-price spiral,\" which would, in turn, make it even harder for the RBA to get this inflation back down and under control. So, the RBA doesn't want wages to grow too quickly. It wants them to stay relatively subdued and for these high prices to eventually wash out of the system, so everything can go back to normal."

Mr Pickering is a former RBA economist so he has insight into how RBA officials would be thinking about things. He's just put out this note on the rate decision, which I think is worth quoting in full: \"The flow of recent economic data provides a compelling case for further rate hikes,” he said. \"While it was also possible to mount a convincing argument for no change, the RBA clearly felt that economic conditions remained too strong to facilitate a sustainable return to its 2-3% inflation target within a reasonable time-frame. \"The RBA anticipates that further rate hikes may well be needed to defeat the current inflation outbreak. However, given that rate hikes hit the Australian economy with a considerable lag, the RBA is also mindful that the economy hasn’t yet felt the full impact of the first rate hikes let alone the ones that followed. That points towards a pretty measured and cautious approach over the next three to six months. \"The key challenge for the RBA is balancing the risks of high inflation against the likelihood that excess tightening plunges the economy into a recession or severe downturn which harms Australian workers and businesses unnecessarily. There is plenty of anecdotal evidence of households doing it rough but so far that hasn’t translated into any meaningful moderation in household or business spending. \"While there were signs of inflation moderating in the monthly figures, sources of domestically-driven inflation remained too strong. Prices of non-tradable goods - a useful proxy for inflation driven by domestic factors - have increased at an annualised pace of 8.1% over the past six months. It won’t be possible for inflation to sustainably return to its 2-3% target unless that number gets down to the high 3% or low 4% range. \"Unfortunately, achieving that requires you to squash domestic demand for goods and services. That normally means higher unemployment, reduced household spending and business investment.\" \" That said, we anticipate that the Australian economy will slow considerably over the second half of the year. This is centered on the belief that household conditions will deteriorate due to the combination of much higher mortgage repayments, softish asset prices and the unprecedented decline in inflation-adjusted wages. This is a recipe for an economic slowdown if ever I’ve seen one. \"While the May increase will come as an unwelcome surprise to many, we don’t anticipate that rates will continue to rise for long. \"We are very close to rates reaching the cycle peak and that will likely become clear over the next three to six months.”"

                  "articleBody": "Dr Dwyfor Evans, the Head of APAC Macro Strategy at State Street Global Markets, says it's interesting what Phil Lowe has focused on in his statement following the monetary policy decision. \"Inflation remains high relative to target, but the softer core inflation released last week gave the Bank some breathing space, particularly on concerns around mortgage rates, but the focus in this instance is high services prices and rising labour costs ,\" Mr Evans said. That's a reference to these lines in Dr Lowe's statement. \" Services price inflation is still very high and broadly based and the experience overseas points to upside risks. \" Unit labour costs are also rising briskly, with productivity growth remaining subdued. \" Wages growth has picked up in response to the tight labour market and high inflation. At the aggregate level, wages growth is still consistent with the inflation target, provided that productivity growth picks up. The Board remains alert to the risk that expectations of ongoing high inflation contribute to larger increases in both prices and wages, especially given the limited spare capacity in the economy and the historically low rate of unemployment. Accordingly, it will continue to pay close attention to both the evolution of labour costs and the price-setting behaviour of firms. \" So Dr Evans thinks that, even though core inflation has weakened enough recently to give the RBA some breathing space, the RBA is concerned enough about wages growth picking up that it wants to crimp some more demand. What's your experience with wages right now?"

The move caught most traders by surprise, with the market only pricing in a 13 per cent chance of rates rising ahead of the RBA's 2:30pm AEST announcement. The majority of the major bank economists were also tipping the Reserve Bank to remain on hold this month, with two forecasting that it had reached the peak of its rate hike cycle at 3.6 per cent. The latest rate increase will add around $78 a month onto repayments for a half a million dollar home loan, if passed on in full by the banks. A customer owing $500,000 will now have seen their repayments rise by around $1,058 a month since the RBA started hiking rates in May last year."

You're forgiven if it's slipped your mind, but in around an hour's time we'll hear what the RBA board has decided to do with the cash rate this month. It's widely tipped that rates will remain on hold at 3.6%, but at last month's meeting the board refused to rule out a future interest rate rise. We'll also get a bit more of an insight than normal into the bank's decision later on today too. Not only will the written decision for rates be published online at 2:30pm AEST, but governor Philip Lowe will be giving a speech at the RBA board dinner in Perth tonight. That's happening at 9:20pm AEST (which works out to be a more respectable 7:20pm in the west). The news just doesn't stop today — but stick with us and we'll bring you the latest as it unfolds."

She spoke to passengers at Sydney's domestic Qantas terminal earlier today, who have mixed views on how the airline treats its customers. \"I don't think they've don't everything perfect in the last couple of years but it's a tough gig,\" said Tracey Cooper, who arrived from Brisbane on a Qantas flight. Ron, who didn't provide his surname and flew in from Melbourne, says he thinks a number of Qantas customers are disappointed by the service. \"Qantas was always a brand you loved and respected,\" he said. \"I think COVID was rough on a lot of airlines and financially airlines took a hit and I think the way that Qantas responded to that has meant that their level of services dropped. \"Customers who were very loyal to Qantas are questioning whether that loyalty was misplaced. \"So I think they've got a way to go to win back their customers … and it's a good time for new management to come in and shake things up.\" But fellow passenger Nuzhat Abonty, who also arrived on the Melbourne flight, spoke very highly of the brand. \"The service is amazing — especially the staff, the comfortable seats.\""

                  "articleBody": "Hi there, Sue Lannin jumping in for a guest post. I've been crunching Qantas' bottom line, and it has made huge losses during the 15 years of outgoing chief executive Alan Joyce's tenure. Aviation is a tough industry, with wars, pandemics, natural disasters, economic slowdowns, and financial crises the main factors that drive away passengers. Over the past 15 years, Qantas has been hit by COVID-19, which shut down the global travel industry, high fuel costs, fleet writedowns, and the global financial crisis, when toxic investments in the US almost brought down the world's financial system. So let's have a look at the financials while Mr Joyce was at the helm. Qantas net profit verses losses breakdown From 2008 to 2022, Qantas lost $2.9 billion, which wiped out the profits it made during the period. The rebound from COVID-19 has seen the airline return to profit for 2023, making a record $1 billion for the half year. Annual net losses 2022: $860 million loss 2021: $1.7 billion loss 2020: $1.9 billion loss 2014: $2.83 billion loss 2012: $$245 million loss 2008 - 2022 Total annual net loss: $7.6 billion Annual net profits 2019: $891 million profit 2018: $980 million profit 2017: $852 million profit 2016: $1.029 billion profit 2015: $560 million profit 2013: $5 million profit 2011:$249 million profit 2010: $112 million profit 2009: $117 million profit 2008: $969 million profit 2008 - 2022 Total annual net profit $4.7 billion"

TWU national secretary Michael Kaine says standards have been \"shattered\" over the 15 years Alan Joyce has been in the role, and says Ms Hudson has a \"golden opportunity\" to correct the airline's trajectory. “Today’s announcement is by no means a sign of relief to aviation workers, especially the 1,700 illegally sacked ground workers still suffering on the sidelines. But this is a golden opportunity for a reset at Qantas,\" he said. “Over a decade Alan Joyce has systematically splintered his workforce and driven down standards to the point where Qantas is a shadow of what it once was. \"Joyce’s position became untenable because Qantas was treated as a corporate vessel for excessive executive bonuses and shareholder dividends. \"Vanessa Hudson must be courageous enough to steer Qantas back to its core purpose: high-quality service for passengers and investment in the hard-working people who built the spirit of Australia.\" Mr Kaine says the union's door is open for Ms Hudson to meet with worker representatives, and comes as the new Qantas boss told a media conference she was looking forward to developing a \"constructive relationship\" with unions."

CEO Brad Banducci said supply chains are slowly recovering, but notes that customers are becoming increasingly wary about the impact that ongoing inflation is having on household budgets. \"In general, customer spending is stable. However, v alue-conscious customers are becoming more thoughtful about their discretionary spend, trading into more affordable options such as our own brands and looking for additional ways to save in store or through our Digital, Rewards and eCommerce platforms,\" Mr Banducci said. The food sales arm of the business saw a 7.6% increase to $12.3 billion in the third quarter, with food retail sales growing by 7.4%."

                  "articleBody": "That's certainly the optimistic forecasts by some, including independent economist Chris Richardson. He believes there's a chance of seeing a \"wafer thin\" surplus over the year to March, which would put treasurer Jim Chalmers in sight of the first budget surplus Australia has seen in 15 years. What's behind this potential surplus? Commodity prices, in particular booming iron ore and thermal coal prices. But that's not to say deficits will be a thing of the past — as senior business correspondent Peter Ryan explains in the clip below 👇"

                  "headline": "ASX set to slip as Reserve Bank rates decision looms",
                  "articleBody": "Good morning, it's Tuesday May 2 and you've found yourself on the ABC's markets and business blog — and what a day we have in front of us. Let's get the elephant in the room out of the way first: it's rates day. The RBA is meeting today to decide what to do with the cash rate, after leaving rates on hold at 3.6% in April. But we know that was a lineball call — in the meeting minutes published a couple of weeks later, the RBA board had considered another rise of 0.25 percentage points. So what could today's decision look like? Major banks and investors are widely predicting the RBA will leave the cash rate unchanged at 3.6%, with data last week showing inflation is slowly coming down. I'll bring you the latest on that decision when it happens at 2:30pm AEST, and all the reaction that follows. On the markets front, the Australian share market is looking to open lower this morning after ASX futures were down -0.1% to 7,336 points as of 7:30am. It follows a mixed performance on Wall Street overnight, with US financial markets largely dominated by the news that regulators had seized First Republic, before selling its assets to JPMorgan Chase to fight off another global banking crisis. First Republic is the third US bank to collapse in just two months, after Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank folded earlier this year. All in all, there's a bit on — pour yourself a coffee and let's see where the day takes us."

There are credible forecasts at the moment that the Albanese Government could actually deliver an exceptionally-thin budget surplus next week. That's for a few reasons, but especially because commodity prices have been far higher than Treasury was forecasting, and because the exceptionally-high levels of immigration we're seeing out the moment are much higher than were forecast.

To someone who doesn't know a lot about economics, it almost feels like they're taking the easy way out trying to keep the big companies happy. - Bec. The RBA can't do much about supply. It can only influence demand (in the short and medium term) by moving interest rates up and down. That's why the RBA is always keeping an eye on wages because wages feed into demand-driven inflation. This is just the system past policymakers built. In the inflation-targeting era, it's been the RBA's job to manage inflation - and the economic cycle - by moving interest rates around to influence demand .",

As a baby boomer who lived through interest rates of 12% and higher 30 years ago, current inflation seems not high at all - Bill. A significant difference with today's environment, compared to past eras, is the level of debt in the economy. When my folks bought their first home in the early 1970s it cost them $35,000. That was 3x their annual income. Today, properties are typically worth upwards of 7x annual income, and well above 10x to 12x in some of our capital cities. And because the cash rate was 0.1% for a time, the size of the recent mortgages banks were willing to extend to people were huge. So, relatively small increases in interest rates are much more impactful today. Now, this might be a slightly left-field way of answering your question quickly, but I recently made a graph of the time when Australia's economic authorities experimented with targeting the money supply to control inflation (at the peak of Milton Friedman's monetarism craze in the late 1970s and early 1980s). It was when Malcolm Fraser was prime minister and John Howard was Treasurer (for most of the time). There were three recessions in that period, including the recession in the early 1980s which was especially bad. It shows how high inflation was in that era. Note inflation fell after each recession. Although, inflation shot up again in 1985, after the Hawke Government floated the dollar in 1983 and deregulated the financial sector.",

Mr Pickering is a former RBA economist so he has insight into how RBA officials would be thinking about things. He's just put out this note on the rate decision, which I think is worth quoting in full: \"The flow of recent economic data provides a compelling case for further rate hikes,” he said. \"While it was also possible to mount a convincing argument for no change, the RBA clearly felt that economic conditions remained too strong to facilitate a sustainable return to its 2-3% inflation target within a reasonable time-frame. \"The RBA anticipates that further rate hikes may well be needed to defeat the current inflation outbreak. However, given that rate hikes hit the Australian economy with a considerable lag, the RBA is also mindful that the economy hasn’t yet felt the full impact of the first rate hikes let alone the ones that followed. That points towards a pretty measured and cautious approach over the next three to six months. \"The key challenge for the RBA is balancing the risks of high inflation against the likelihood that excess tightening plunges the economy into a recession or severe downturn which harms Australian workers and businesses unnecessarily. There is plenty of anecdotal evidence of households doing it rough but so far that hasn’t translated into any meaningful moderation in household or business spending. \"While there were signs of inflation moderating in the monthly figures, sources of domestically-driven inflation remained too strong. Prices of non-tradable goods - a useful proxy for inflation driven by domestic factors - have increased at an annualised pace of 8.1% over the past six months. It won’t be possible for inflation to sustainably return to its 2-3% target unless that number gets down to the high 3% or low 4% range. \"Unfortunately, achieving that requires you to squash domestic demand for goods and services. That normally means higher unemployment, reduced household spending and business investment.\" \" That said, we anticipate that the Australian economy will slow considerably over the second half of the year. This is centered on the belief that household conditions will deteriorate due to the combination of much higher mortgage repayments, softish asset prices and the unprecedented decline in inflation-adjusted wages. This is a recipe for an economic slowdown if ever I’ve seen one. \"While the May increase will come as an unwelcome surprise to many, we don’t anticipate that rates will continue to rise for long. \"We are very close to rates reaching the cycle peak and that will likely become clear over the next three to six months.”",

That's a reference to these lines in Dr Lowe's statement. \" Services price inflation is still very high and broadly based and the experience overseas points to upside risks. \" Unit labour costs are also rising briskly, with productivity growth remaining subdued. \" Wages growth has picked up in response to the tight labour market and high inflation. At the aggregate level, wages growth is still consistent with the inflation target, provided that productivity growth picks up. The Board remains alert to the risk that expectations of ongoing high inflation contribute to larger increases in both prices and wages, especially given the limited spare capacity in the economy and the historically low rate of unemployment. Accordingly, it will continue to pay close attention to both the evolution of labour costs and the price-setting behaviour of firms. \" So Dr Evans thinks that, even though core inflation has weakened enough recently to give the RBA some breathing space, the RBA is concerned enough about wages growth picking up that it wants to crimp some more demand. What's your experience with wages right now?",

The move caught most traders by surprise, with the market only pricing in a 13 per cent chance of rates rising ahead of the RBA's 2:30pm AEST announcement. The majority of the major bank economists were also tipping the Reserve Bank to remain on hold this month, with two forecasting that it had reached the peak of its rate hike cycle at 3.6 per cent. The latest rate increase will add around $78 a month onto repayments for a half a million dollar home loan, if passed on in full by the banks. A customer owing $500,000 will now have seen their repayments rise by around $1,058 a month since the RBA started hiking rates in May last year.",

You're forgiven if it's slipped your mind, but in around an hour's time we'll hear what the RBA board has decided to do with the cash rate this month. It's widely tipped that rates will remain on hold at 3.6%, but at last month's meeting the board refused to rule out a future interest rate rise. We'll also get a bit more of an insight than normal into the bank's decision later on today too. Not only will the written decision for rates be published online at 2:30pm AEST, but governor Philip Lowe will be giving a speech at the RBA board dinner in Perth tonight. That's happening at 9:20pm AEST (which works out to be a more respectable 7:20pm in the west). The news just doesn't stop today — but stick with us and we'll bring you the latest as it unfolds.",

She spoke to passengers at Sydney's domestic Qantas terminal earlier today, who have mixed views on how the airline treats its customers. \"I don't think they've don't everything perfect in the last couple of years but it's a tough gig,\" said Tracey Cooper, who arrived from Brisbane on a Qantas flight. Ron, who didn't provide his surname and flew in from Melbourne, says he thinks a number of Qantas customers are disappointed by the service. \"Qantas was always a brand you loved and respected,\" he said. \"I think COVID was rough on a lot of airlines and financially airlines took a hit and I think the way that Qantas responded to that has meant that their level of services dropped. \"Customers who were very loyal to Qantas are questioning whether that loyalty was misplaced. \"So I think they've got a way to go to win back their customers … and it's a good time for new management to come in and shake things up.\" But fellow passenger Nuzhat Abonty, who also arrived on the Melbourne flight, spoke very highly of the brand. \"The service is amazing — especially the staff, the comfortable seats.\"",

I've been crunching Qantas' bottom line, and it has made huge losses during the 15 years of outgoing chief executive Alan Joyce's tenure. Aviation is a tough industry, with wars, pandemics, natural disasters, economic slowdowns, and financial crises the main factors that drive away passengers. Over the past 15 years, Qantas has been hit by COVID-19, which shut down the global travel industry, high fuel costs, fleet writedowns, and the global financial crisis, when toxic investments in the US almost brought down the world's financial system. So let's have a look at the financials while Mr Joyce was at the helm. Qantas net profit verses losses breakdown From 2008 to 2022, Qantas lost $2.9 billion, which wiped out the profits it made during the period. The rebound from COVID-19 has seen the airline return to profit for 2023, making a record $1 billion for the half year. Annual net losses 2022: $860 million loss 2021: $1.7 billion loss 2020: $1.9 billion loss 2014: $2.83 billion loss 2012: $$245 million loss 2008 - 2022 Total annual net loss: $7.6 billion Annual net profits 2019: $891 million profit 2018: $980 million profit 2017: $852 million profit 2016: $1.029 billion profit 2015: $560 million profit 2013: $5 million profit 2011:$249 million profit 2010: $112 million profit 2009: $117 million profit 2008: $969 million profit 2008 - 2022 Total annual net profit $4.7 billion",

But this is a golden opportunity for a reset at Qantas,\" he said. “Over a decade Alan Joyce has systematically splintered his workforce and driven down standards to the point where Qantas is a shadow of what it once was. \"Joyce’s position became untenable because Qantas was treated as a corporate vessel for excessive executive bonuses and shareholder dividends. \"Vanessa Hudson must be courageous enough to steer Qantas back to its core purpose: high-quality service for passengers and investment in the hard-working people who built the spirit of Australia.\" Mr Kaine says the union's door is open for Ms Hudson to meet with worker representatives, and comes as the new Qantas boss told a media conference she was looking forward to developing a \"constructive relationship\" with unions.",

Let's get the elephant in the room out of the way first: it's rates day. The RBA is meeting today to decide what to do with the cash rate, after leaving rates on hold at 3.6% in April. But we know that was a lineball call — in the meeting minutes published a couple of weeks later, the RBA board had considered another rise of 0.25 percentage points. So what could today's decision look like? Major banks and investors are widely predicting the RBA will leave the cash rate unchanged at 3.6%, with data last week showing inflation is slowly coming down. I'll bring you the latest on that decision when it happens at 2:30pm AEST, and all the reaction that follows. On the markets front, the Australian share market is looking to open lower this morning after ASX futures were down -0.1% to 7,336 points as of 7:30am. It follows a mixed performance on Wall Street overnight, with US financial markets largely dominated by the news that regulators had seized First Republic, before selling its assets to JPMorgan Chase to fight off another global banking crisis. First Republic is the third US bank to collapse in just two months, after Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank folded earlier this year. All in all, there's a bit on — pour yourself a coffee and let's see where the day takes us.",
