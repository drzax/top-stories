It's a return to profitability for the energy company, which reported a loss of $1.4 billion last year. The energy retailer notes that that its underlying earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) for energy markets increased by $637 million to $1.038 billion, and that its electricity profits rose as higher wholesale energy costs were recovered in tariffs and the \"optimisation of the energy supply portfolio\". The gains also come despite the global energy crunch, which has sent gas and electricity prices higher. It also forecasts more growth in the coming financial year, before moderating in the 2025 financial year. Origin will pay shareholders a fully-franked final dividend of 20 cents per share .",

Profit attributable to Telstra equity holders was up 14.2% to $1.93 billion. The rise in profit was based on a 5.4% increase in total income to $23.2 billion. \"We remain disciplined on reducing our costs, particularly considering the external economic environment,\" said Telstra's CEO Vicki Brady. Ms Brady said her priority was to continue to improve customer experience and further reduce complaints to the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman, which the company said fell by more than a third on the previous year. Telstra also revealed that its current plan is to retain ownership of its infrastructure business, InfraCo Fixed, \"for at least the medium term\" after it was structurally separated out from the rest of the firm earlier this year, meaning a sale or public share float is off the table for now. The telco was cautious in its guidance, predicting total income should be slightly higher than current levels but could be lower ($22.8 to $24.8 billion), while underlying profits before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) of $8.2-8.4 billion would be slightly higher than this year's $8 billion result. \"While our cost reduction ambition is being challenged by high inflation, we still expect to achieve the large majority of this by financial year 2025,\" added Ms Brady. The company will pay a fully-franked final dividend of 8.5 cents per share bringing total dividends for the year to 17 cents, slightly up on last year.",
