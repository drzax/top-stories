Netanyahu's comments this week suggesting that Israel would be responsible for Gaza security indefinitely drew pushback from the United States, Israel's main ally, with Washington saying it would oppose Israeli post-war occupation of Gaza. \"We don't seek to conquer Gaza, we don't seek to occupy Gaza, and we don't seek to govern Gaza,\" Netanyau told Fox News. Netanyahu said a civilian government would need to take shape in Gaza but that Israel would make sure something like the October 7 attack does not happen again. \"So, we have to have a credible force that, if necessary, will enter Gaza and kill the killers. Because that's what will prevent the reemergence of a Hamas-like entity,\" Netanyahu said. US officials say the Palestinian Authority (PA), which has limited self-rule in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, should return to govern Gaza after the war. Hamas seized control of Gaza from the PA forces of President Mahmoud Abbas in 2007. Top Palestinian officials, including Abbas, say a PA return to Gaza must be accompanied by a political solution that ends Israel's occupation of territory it captured in the 1967 Middle East war. Netanyahu said that after the war, \"what we have to see is Gaza demilitarised, deradicalised and rebuilt\". Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh told PBS this week the PA would not return to Gaza \"on the back of an Israeli tank\". Reuters",

Overnight Israel's military conducted a raid in the city of Jenin, reportedly killing 14 people. Doctors Without Borders said on the morning of the raid \"leaflets were dropped on Jenin refugee camp, telling residents to evacuate, many of whom have no safe place to go\". The group said it witnessed Israeli forces firing at the entrance of a hospital, shooting at an emergency unit and using military vehicles to block ambulances from entering hospitals. A paramedic was also shot while inside an ambulance, the charity said. \"Hospitals are not targets and must remain safe spaces. Medical care must not be impeded,\" Doctors Without Borders said on X. \"We call on the Israeli military to stop firing on hospitals and to stop their military vehicles from blocking ambulances and medical staff from reaching health care facilities.\" Israel's military has not released a response to these claims, but said on social media that it had conducted \"counterterrorism activity\" in the Jenin refugee camp and killed multiple terrorists.",

On Thursday (local time) the city of Jenin was rocked by dozens of explosions as Israeli armoured vehicles tore through the streets, fighting running battles with Palestinian gunmen using assault rifles and pipe bombs. Four more were killed elsewhere in the West Bank on Thursday, the health ministry said, putting the toll of Palestinians killed in the West Bank since October 7 at more than 180 people. Three Israelis were killed in violence in the West Bank over that period, according to officials. On Telegram the Israel Defense Forces confirmed it had conducted an operation in Jenin, claiming it had killed more than 10 terrorists and arrested more than 20 \"wanted suspects\". However advocacy organisation Defense for Children says two of those killed in Jenin on Thursday were children. Unlike Gaza, which is ruled by Hamas, the governing body in the West Bank is the Palestinian Authority. AFP/ABC",

Any gains it's made so far this week are now nowhere to be found, meaning the ASX is on track to close at the lowest level all week. The falls come after the RBA increased its inflation forecasts in its latest statement of monetary policy. It now expects inflation to fall to 4.5% by December, but wouldn't reach the top of its 2-3% target band until December 2025. Meanwhile, all but one of the sectors are in the red — basic materials is up 0.2%. Utilities has fallen the most (-1.4%), followed by financials (-1%), industrials (-0.9%), energy (-0.8%) and academic and educational services (-0.8%). Both technology and consumer non-cyclicals have dipped by 0.7%, followed by real estate (-0.6%), consumer cyclicals (-0.5%) and healthcare (-0.4%). As for the best performers: Neuren Pharmaceuticals +4.8% Breville +2.5% Light & Wonder +1.4% Emerald Resources +1.4% Fortescue Metals +1.3% And the worst performers: Sayona Mining -6.9% Chalice Mining -6.4% Core Lithium -5.8% Healius -4.7% Alumina -4%",

In the three months to September 30, REA Group's adjusted earnings (or operating EBITDA) came in at $198 million — 13% higher than Q1 last financial year — while its revenue was up 12% to $341 million. \"Australia's largest residential property markets, Sydney and Melbourne, have experienced a stronger than typical winter and this strength has continued into spring,\" REA Group said in a statement to the ASX. \"Nationally, increased activity is being driven by the continuation of strong demand, supported by near record employment and immigration, and increasing supply with the return to peak prices improving seller confidence. \"The stabilisation of interest rates for several months, which ended with this week's rate rise, played a key role in building market confidence. \"This increase and any further increases in rates from current levels could have a negative impact on sentiment .\" REA Group's CEO, Owen Wilson, said the strong results were thanks to the strength in the property market and healthy demand from buyers. But despite the strong performance, REA Group's stock price is losing ground today, down around 2% at lunch.",
