Treasury's forecast for GDP (or economic growth) in the May budget was 3.25% for the 2022-23 financial year, and Senator Hume asked if that was going to be achieved. Ineke Redmond from Treasury said they still needed to compile and review data to form a more thorough assessment, but said developments including population growth (including migration) could see an increase in GDP, if not equalling that forecast, despite a slightly sharp fall in consumption because of inflation and interest rates. Treasury's Luke Yeaman also reiterated Ms Redmond's comments and said overall the economy was tracking \"quite close\" to its growth forecasts. Mr Yeaman said while he wouldn't attribute a number to economic growth right now, the economy was developing broadly in line with its expectations as forecast in the budget. (For what it's worth, the RBA's just released economic outlook within its August Statement on Monetary Policy shows the central bank is now expecting a year-average GDP growth to be 3% for the 2022-23 financial year .)",

              "plaintext": "A brief hello from me — I've spent the morning listening to the Select Committee on the Cost of Living, where senators were asking Treasury officials about all things inflation and living cost pressures (as the name might suggest). Committee member senator Karen Grogan asked Treasury's Luke Yeaman whether the federal budget handed down in May was inflationary. Mr Yeaman explained that the economy had been seeing a substantial fiscal contraction, which had helped to take the pressure off inflation, and the budget contained measures that helped to reduce inflation (like rent, childcare and electricity bill assistance). He said Treasury's overall sense was that the budget was not adding to inflation, and that had also been the general reaction from financial markets. This line of questioning was also picked up by the committee chair, senator Jane Hume, who asked if the budget was \"deflationary\". Mr Yeaman responded that the budget was \"broadly neutral\" and reiterated that there was a substantial contraction and explained that while fiscal policy did have some lagging elements that took time to flow through, there were contractionary elements that were also coming through to keep inflation lower. He again explained that electricity prices, childcare and Commonwealth rental assistance were having direct downwards impacts while inflation and CPI was high. He said he understood the comments around the budget, but maintained that Treasury's stance was that the budget was helping bring inflation down. (I also wrote about what impact the federal budget could have on interest rates and inflation after it was handed down — you can have a read of that below.)",
