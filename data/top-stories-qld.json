Israel says aid can enter through Egypt as long as supplies do not end up in the hands of Hamas. In a social media post on Sunday morning, UN Secretary-General António Guterres called for three things: Immediate, unrestricted & sustained humanitarian aid for civilians in Gaza Immediate & unconditional release of all hostages Immediate & dedicated efforts to prevent the spread of violence, which is increasing the risk of spillover",
