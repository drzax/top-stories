              "plaintext": "After trending higher thanks to the Matildas and the FIFA Women's World Cup in September, household spending dropped substantially last month, down 1%, according to the latest CommBank Household Spending Insights index. The 1% fall was driven by fewer Australian households spending on recreation (-4.7%), hospitality (-4.5%), food and beverage (-1.3%), communication and digital (-0.7%) and household goods (-0.7%). Despite the falls in those categories, CommBank said they were offset by higher spending in the utilities and transport categories as a result of higher energy bills and petrol prices. “October’s CommBank HSI Index demonstrates a clear tightening in consumer spending compared to September’s result, which was buoyed by a number of one-off events like the FIFA Women's World Cup,\" CBA chief economist Stephen Halmarick said. \" We are clearly seeing the flow on effects of the interest rate increases from earlier in the year .\" He expects the latest rate hike from the RBA last week will add \"even further\" downward pressure on spending in the coming months, but there could be increased spending due to the November sales season. \"Looking ahead, our base case is no further increases in the RBA cash rate, although there remains upside risk based on the inflation figures due at the end of January,\" he said.",

Deutsche Bank's chief economist in Australia, Phil O'Donaghoe, says both economies have similar variable rate mortgages (more than 90% of the outstanding stock in Norway, while Australia's is approaching 80%). In addition, he says both Norway's central bank and the RBA have hiked by 4.25 percentage points so far. Looking at Norway's latest inflation data, Mr O'Donaghoe said the Scandinavian country printed a \"solid inflation beat\" in October, with both headline and core inflation double expectations. \"Norges Bank was the first G10 central bank to hike this cycle (Sep 2021), eight  months before the RBA (May 2022),\" he wrote. \"As such, Norges Bank has been tightening  policy for more than two years, beyond the timeframe for most of the 'long and  variable lags' in monetary policy. \"Like the RBA, however, the cumulative magnitude  of hikes has fallen short of other G10 central banks. \"Against that backdrop, Norwegian inflation remains well above target and re-accelerated on the latest read.\" Mr O'Donaghoe says the market currently expects Norway's central bank to hike by 0.25 percentage points to 4.5% at its meeting on December 14, but is not expecting the RBA to hike again on December 5. \"Australia prints wages and employment data later this week. Beats on those data  points will be crucial for the RBA's deliberations in December,\" he said. \"The market may not  think the RBA will hike back to back in December, but we think if local data this week  and beyond beat expectations, they can hike. We definitely think the RBA should. \"No way or Norway? Time will tell.\"",
