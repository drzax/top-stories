Look at this graph: What it's showing you is that, even before this month's 0.25 percentage point rate rise, the interest charged on CBA customers' home loans had risen more than 50%. It also also showing you that their scheduled repayments — the money actually coming out of their account each month — had risen less than 20 per cent up to April. The scary thing? Over the next few months that blue line has to move much closer to the red line. This shows most mortgage customers are yet to feel anywhere near the full impact of the rate rises that have already happened. Why? Because there is roughly a three month lag between when an RBA rate rise happens and when the higher minimum repayment amount is passed through to the customer. And this is even before the full impact of the fixed rate mortgage cliff hits. CBA's internal data shows last month was the first big step up in fixed loans rolling off onto variable rates. All of these customers are facing interest rates that have more than doubled, in many cases tripled, since they took out their fixed loans. And CBA economist Stephen Wu says those customers will also have a lag between when their fixed loan expires until their scheduled repayments rise. \"At CBA there is generally a lag of around a few months between when a fixed term loan expires and when the required mortgage repayment steps up,\" he explained. It's a reality check as to why the RBA needs to be very careful in raising rates further until it sees the effect of the hikes it's already implemented. Yesterday's jobs data is being interpreted by many economists as a likely turning point in the labour market, where unemployment turns higher.",

G7 leaders are gathering in Hiroshima on Friday and the invasion of Ukraine is high on the agenda: A U.S. official, speaking to reporters on Thursday ahead of the gathering, said the G7's latest efforts were aimed at disrupting Russia's ability to get materials it needs for the battlefield, close loopholes used to evade sanctions, further reduce international reliance on Russian energy, and narrow Moscow's access to the international financial system. \"Our commitment to continue tightening the screws on Russia remains as strong as it was last year,\" the official said. The United States and its allies, including the European Union and Britain, have continued to ratchet up sanctions and export-control pressure on Russia since the invasion of Ukraine began in February 2022. Thousands of targets hit with sanctions by Washington so far have included Russian President Vladimir Putin, the financial sector and oligarchs. The latest U.S. sanctions package will include \"extensively restricting categories of goods key to the battlefield\" as well as preventing some 70 entities from Russia and third countries from receiving U.S. exports by adding them to the U.S. Commerce Department's blacklist. In addition, the United States will announce some 300 new sanctions against individuals, entities, vessels and aircraft targeting \"financial facilitators\", Russia's future energy extracting capabilities, and others across Europe, the Middle East and Asia helping to support the war. U.S. sanctions authorities would also be expanded to more sectors of the Russian economy. The U.S. official said Washington would take significant steps to align its actions closely with the EU and Britain to ensure that the G7 remained as coordinated as possible in response to \"Russia's brutal actions\".",
