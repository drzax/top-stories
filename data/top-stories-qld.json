Dr Muhanna says he has been able to send five critical patients to a specialist centre but still has 10 in the hospital and is struggling to move them. \"All the hospitals are overcrowded,\" he's told ABC News. \"Even if I want to coordinate with other hospitals, I can't. They have no beds. They're putting patients in the corridors. \"We have supplies for one-and-a-half months, but that's on regular days. In war days, the consumption increases more than 50 to 70 per cent. \"This storage of medications will last 10-14 days maximum.

Australia's Foreign Minister Penny Wong said officials were looking to arrange another flight today, subject to security and operational constraints. Speaking to ABC News Breakfast, Senator Wong warned it could be the last repatriation flight for the foreseeable future and Australians in Lebanon should also consider leaving. \"Look, this connects to the broader risk that so many countries of the world are seeking to avoid — and that is regional spillover,\" she said. \"Obviously we see the events, tragic events in Israel, we see the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, but the thing that many countries are seeking to avert is regional spillover. In relation to Lebanon, what I've said to people is — please consider if you need to stay. We have not said, \"Do not travel\". But we have said \"If you are there, please consider if your presence is essential\". A lot of work was being done to by the United States, Egypt, Jordan — regional partners — to stop that spillover happening. Senator Wong also said despite work to get 19 Australians out of Gaza, efforts had so far not been successful.",

The incoming boss of PwC Australia was criticised for bringing Ms Walsh, because she was so new in the role and couldn't answer questions about the historic allegations the committee is investigating - and the 'now and future' problems they've created. Asked about her status in the firm, she responded: \"I have been with the firm for three years and I've been in my current role as chief people officer since July.\" And today, she's gone! Ms Walsh will become Chief People Officer at Qantas, a press release has announced. \"In this new role, Ms Walsh will help drive a stronger relationship between Qantas and its 25,000 employees, as well as with the unions that represent them. This function will also help lead the recruitment of thousands of new roles across the Group in coming years as it takes delivery of new aircraft and returns to growth.\" The airline has a bit of work to do in the 'HR space'... it fought it's own employees all the way to the appeals court of the High Court, losing all the way, after it sacked 1700 of them illegally. As was reported at the time: Qantas maintained it made the decision for sound commercial reasons after its business plummeted by more than 90 per cent. But the Transport Workers' Union (TWU) told the High Court the airline had also been motivated to head off industrial action when things returned to normal. The union said the sackings were in breach of the Fair Work Act, which prohibited actions that interfered with a worker's rights. Ms Walsh will start in January 2024.",
