Deutsche Bank's chief economist in Australia, Phil O'Donaghoe, says both economies have similar variable rate mortgages (more than 90% of the outstanding stock in Norway, while Australia's is approaching 80%). In addition, he says both Norway's central bank and the RBA have hiked by 4.25 percentage points so far. Looking at Norway's latest inflation data, Mr O'Donaghoe said the Scandinavian country printed a \"solid inflation beat\" in October, with both headline and core inflation double expectations. \"Norges Bank was the first G10 central bank to hike this cycle (Sep 2021), eight  months before the RBA (May 2022),\" he wrote. \"As such, Norges Bank has been tightening  policy for more than two years, beyond the timeframe for most of the 'long and  variable lags' in monetary policy. \"Like the RBA, however, the cumulative magnitude  of hikes has fallen short of other G10 central banks. \"Against that backdrop, Norwegian inflation remains well above target and re-accelerated on the latest read.\" Mr O'Donaghoe says the market currently expects Norway's central bank to hike by 0.25 percentage points to 4.5% at its meeting on December 14, but is not expecting the RBA to hike again on December 5. \"Australia prints wages and employment data later this week. Beats on those data  points will be crucial for the RBA's deliberations in December,\" he said. \"The market may not  think the RBA will hike back to back in December, but we think if local data this week  and beyond beat expectations, they can hike. We definitely think the RBA should. \"No way or Norway? Time will tell.\"",
