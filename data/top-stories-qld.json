But Mr Dutton said the treasury and finance bosses should be ruled out of the running. \"We can't have a situation where the government is appointing somebody who is familiar to the government, in the sense they have worked very closely with ministers, or the treasurer or the finance minister,\" Mr Dutton said. \"We can't have somebody who has been appointed by the Labor Party or indeed the Coalition to a senior position within government. It needs to be somebody who is independent and has the best interests of the Australian public in mind.\" You can keep reading this story from political reporter Jake Evans below:",
