Hey Tim, We can't provide you advice on what the best course of action is to take with your mortgage — we aren't licensed to do so (it's also why we have that little disclaimer at the top of the blog). That said, there are thousands of home owners who are coming off their fixed rate and are bracing for the impact of these higher rates. A couple of months ago our colleague Stephanie Chalmers pulled together this handy guide if you're already struggling with mortgage repayments. But if you're trying to get ahead of the curve, we've also got you covered. Emily Stewart asked the experts this very question last year, and pulled together this quick guide to help you prepare — and who to ask for advice. I've linked it below for you to have a read of (or you can bookmark it for another day).",

So can we expect that there will be no cuts in the target inflation rate for another 2½ to 3 years? Or is the Bank likely to start cutting before the target band is reached? 3 years is a long time to absorb the current minimum repayments. - Luke - Perth. Hi Luke, thanks for writing in. Currently, annual inflation is sitting at 6%, which is double the highest level the RBA is willing to tolerate. The RBA is expecting we won't see inflation in that range until 2025, and that's because inflation is a really pesky thing to try and bring down, and it takes a lot of time. Inflation is often referred to as \"sticky\" because it sticks around at those higher levels — and you only have to look at the past 18 months or so to see just how rapidly inflation surged in the economy, and how it's only just now cooling off. Quarterly inflation figures from the ABS show inflation only peaked at 7.8% in the three months to December last year — several months after the RBA started lifting rates. To keep it simple, the RBA is using a bunch of economic data to model when inflation might come back to that 2-3% range it wants, which is where it's getting that late-2025 date from. But to get us to that point at all, the theory goes that higher rates need to be sustained to suppress spending — which is why we won't be seeing any rate cuts any time soon. For what it's worth though, last month the major banks were expecting the first round of rate cuts sometime in 2024 — although that was their position before inflation data was released. It's also worth pointing out that the RBA itself has (very intentionally) not given a time frame to when rate cuts might happen.",

It's simply referring to how much the prices of services (think hairdressing, vet services, insurance) are rising — and last week's inflation data from the ABS showed that services inflation was gathering pace while goods inflation was falling. You can see the divergence between the two below: The ABS said inflation in the prices for services recorded its largest annual rise since 2001, driven by higher prices in a range of services categories including rents, restaurant meals, holiday travel and insurance. Services inflation is now running at 6.3%, up from 6.1% in the March quarter. So it's still heading higher, but goods inflation is definitely heading down — it's at 5.8%, down from 7.6% in March.",
