The decision is at the heart of a political storm with the government accused of protecting Qantas, with critics saying that allowing more international flights will reduce airfares. Senators voted 32 to 31 to establish an inquiry examining the impacts of the Qatar Airways decision, including the cost of flights. But Treasurer Jim Chalmers has told RN Breakfast that the government has no intention of reviewing the decision, and the \"decision was the right one, taken in the usual way.\" \"I think the priority now becomes the aviation green paper, Catherine King, the Minister for Transport, has been working very hard on aviation sector reform. You'll see a green paper before long and then a white paper, I think, next year from memory and that's our focus.\" Shadow transport minister Brigid McKenzie says the inquiry will examine why the decision was made. \"I think it's been clear over the last couple of weeks in particular that Australians have a lot of questions about why this government keeps making decisions that keep airfares high and cancellations and delays in the wrong direction.\" Meanwhile, it was a dramatic day yesterday with Qantas boss Alan Joyce stepping down early, replaced by Vanessa Hudson who has pledged to put customers first.

A rise in oil prices has seen US stocks fall overnight on the first trading day of a holiday shortened week. The Dow Jones index fell 0.6 per cent after oil prices increased to the highest since November as Saudi Arabia and Russia extended voluntary production cuts. Bond yields jumped with the yield on the 10 year US Treasury bond rising 0.06 per cent to 4.27 per cent as investors focus on the Federal Reserve's next move on interest rates. The Australian share market is expected to open lower this morning. The Australian dollar fell more than 1 per cent overnight to 63.77 US cents after the RBA kept official interest rates on hold for the third month in a row and as the greenback gained to the highest level since March. That's a ten month low. And investors are awaiting the June quarter GDP figures which will be out at 11:30 AEST. They expected to show a further annual economic slow down as interest rate rises work their way through the economy. Economists are predicting the economy expanded by 0.3 per cent over the June quarter, and by 1.8 per cent over the year. Over the first few months of the year, the economy grew by 0.2 per cent and by 2.3 per cent on an annual basis. Join us for all today's markets news.",
