It comes after the consumer watchdog launched legal action last week alleging the airline sold 8,000 tickets for flights it had already cancelled. The airline has also been accused of bullying smaller airlines and influencing the Albanese government to block Qatar Airways from doubling its capacity into Australia. The airline has admitted its reputation has been 'hit hard on several fronts.' Alan Joyce says in the last few weeks the focus on Qantas means the company needs to move ahead with its renewal. \"The best thing I can do under these circumstances is to bring forward my retirement and hand over to Vanessa and the new management team now, knowing they will do an excellent job.\" Alan Joyce has been CEO for the past 15 years. \"There have been many ups and downs, and there is clearly much work still to be done, especially to make sure we always deliver for our customers.\" Vanessa Hudson will take on the top job effective tomorrow.",
