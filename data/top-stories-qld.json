ANZ monitors the spending made through its cards and merchant payment facilities (i.e. point-of-sale terminals) to get a near-real time pulse on consumer spending. There isn't much of one. Over the week to August 5, spending dived 8% compared with the same period a year earlier. Considering how much prices have risen for most things over that year, that is a huge fall in the volume of goods and services being purchased. As you can see, Aussies cut spending on almost everything, even staples like groceries. The only sector going up was entertainment, driven by a 95% jump in cinema spending as the Barbie movie and Oppenheimer opened at the same time, the so-called \"Barbenheimer\" effect. We're not even going out for meals or drinks anymore, with dining-out spending now below pre-pandemic levels in 2019. \"The ongoing softness in ANZ-observed spending, alongside the weak ABS household spending indicator and negative retail volumes print, suggests the RBA's efforts to curb spending are working,\" note ANZ economists Madeline Dunk and Adelaide Timbrell. \"Many households are facing a cashflow squeeze and are adjusting by curbing spending.\"",

It made US$400 million ( $612 million in Australian dollars ) net profit after income tax for the half year ended 30 June, up from $US48 million for the prior period, an increase of 733%. It will pay a dividend of 14 cents (Australian) per share. That's higher than the previous corresponding period's 9 cents. Its share price has lost 2.5% in value this morning, down 39 cents to $15.21. QBE has lifted its group-wide premiums to offset an increase in claims, like its rival Suncorp. The global insurer operates in more than two dozen countries, and its group-wide premium rate increases averaged 10.2% in the first half of this year, compared with 8.1% in prior period. The net cost of its catastrophe claims increased to $US699 million, or 8.7% of net insurance revenue, compared to 6.2% in the prior period. Its catastrophe costs were underscored by the historically bad weather events in New Zealand in February (damaging flooding and Cyclone Gabrielle) and material convective storm activity in North America. Here's how QBE's premium increases look by region: North America: +10.9% International: +9.4% Australia Pacific: +11.8% Also like Suncorp, QBE's final profit result was achieved with help from large investment returns. Total investment income for the period was $US662 million, compared with a loss of $US20 million for the prior period. It says those investment returns reflect the significant increase in interest rates over the period and a gain of $US52 million from tighter credit spreads.",

Its result was boosted by a $209 million gain on the sale of its international infrastructure equity business, while the previous year's first-half result was even more inflated by the sale of its real estate and domestic infrastructure business. Looking at only the businesses that AMP continues to operate, net profit came in at $52 million, down 45% from the previous first-half result. AMP said its underlying profit results were roughly in line with the first-half last year at $112 million. The company said its banking division saw a 24% rise in profit, while its investment platform saw underlying profits up nearly 26%. Its advice business posted a $25 million underlying loss, although AMP said this was smaller than last year. \"We have significantly reduced the size and complexity of AMP's business, whilst continuing to resolve legacy issues,\" said the financial firm's CEO Alexis George. \"We have outlined a target to deliver $120 million in run rate controllable cost savings by FY 25, with a $60 million reduction in FY 24 and a similar number for FY 25. \"This will be achieved through simplifying our technology architecture, removing stranded costs, reducing group costs including property, continued focus on the Advice business, replatforming our Master Trust business and a disciplined approach to project spend.\" Between divestments and cost-cutting, AMP is striving to shrink its way back to greatness.",
