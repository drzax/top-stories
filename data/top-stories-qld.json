Original released a song titled Yes, delivering an impassioned endorsement of a Yes vote in the referendum on an Indigenous Voice to Parliament. The track featuring Indigenous rapper Briggs, has gone off with over 4 million hits already. \"I think that it speaks to that generation,\" says Briggs on the popularity of the song. \"I reckon this is how people are talking in the pubs and in the lounge rooms.\" An impressive line-up of artists including Paul Kelly, Jimmy Barnes and Hilltop Hoods will be performing at Shepparton today, hoping to inform more people about the Voice referendum. Organised by Briggs, the day-long Yes concert is aimed at undecided voters. \"Over the last few weeks, I was just wanting to put more positive stuff into the sphere, because it was like, so much vitriol and so negative,\" Briggs tells ABC News Breakfast. \"And I think that the best way that we can show people what a Yes might look like is by putting a show together with artists that share the same kind of vision for unity and solidarity.\" Victoria has been inundated with heavy rains this week but the rapper and activist is hopeful the rain will hold off today. Can't make it to the gig? Luckily, there's a First and Forever Special streaming now on iview, showcasing live music highlights from Baker Boy, Briggs & many more.",

The Indigenous senator says the police failed to protect her and ministers from across the board including Prime Minister Anthony Albanese have condemned the abuse directed at Ms Thorpe. \"There is a question for the no campaign to answer about these sorts of extremists on the no side,\" says Yes vote advocate Thomas Mayo. He says it is an issue to be answered but people should not forget what the referendum is about. \"We can't be distracted. That sort of thing needs to be dealt with but this referendum is ultimately at the end of the day just about recognising Indigenous people by giving us a say,\" he said speaking on ABC News Breakfast. \"It is horrible to see that behaviour and those threats and it is something that we don't want to see in Australian politics.\" With just over a week left for the Voice to Parliament referendum vote, both sides are making the final push to secure more votes. \"We have just got to keep our focus on improving this country, building a better future for our children, for all Australians by saying yes,\" he says.",
