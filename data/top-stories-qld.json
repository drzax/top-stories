The American ABC news outlet has reported that Mr Trump told Mr Pratt the supposed number of nuclear warheads on US submarines, and how close they could get to a Russian submarine without being detected. The conversation is said to have taken place at Mr Trump's Mar-a-Lago club in Florida several months after he left office. The alleged conversation was not mentioned by federal prosecutors when they charged the former president with mishandling classified material, but ABC is reporting Mr Pratt — who is the chairman of paper and packaging companies, Visy and Pratt Industries — was interviewed. The American ABC news outlet has no affiliation with ABC News here in Australia. Mr Pratt has been contacted for comment and is not accused of wrongdoing, while a spokesperson for Mr Trump criticised what he called \"illegal leaks\" and said he'd always acted lawfully.

But despite the global economic challenges, he says Australia is well placed to navigate a slower economic environment. He also acknowledged the current state of the economy with higher interest rates and inflation impacting thousands of households. Here's his statement in full: \"The RBA report is an important reminder of the ongoing pressures facing the global financial system and the global economy,\" he said. \" Higher interest rates, persistent inflation and the slowdown in China, particularly its struggling property sector, are weighing on global growth and will inevitably contribute to slower growth at home over the year ahead. \"In the face of the challenges coming at us from around the world, Australia's resilient labour market and well-regulated financial system are among our strengths. \"We know Australians are doing it tough and higher interest rates will continue to bite, particularly as more and more households come off lower fixed-rate mortgages. \"In these difficult times, the Albanese Government is focused on making the budget more responsible and our economy more resilient, while rolling out billions of dollars of cost-of-living relief in a way that doesn't add to inflationary pressures .",

It's all because the fund manager reported a $4 billion drop in funds under management as of September, down to $35 billion. Investors clearly are not happy. PEXA Group has also been in the red, down by -5.5%. Macquarie has cut its price target for the digital property settlements platform because of its acquisition of UK-based Smoove. The brokerage says the deal lacks execution details and that Smoove is a loss making business. When it comes to the sectors: energy and healthcare are leading the losses (-0.5% and -0.3% respectively). The sectors doing well today are academic and education services (+0.5%), financials (+0.3%) and industrials (+0.3%). Let's take a look at the top movers : QBE Insurance (+2.3%) Iress Ltd (+2%) Telix Pharmaceuticals (+1.8%) Block Inc (+1.8%) Aristocrat Leisure (+1.7%) The bottom movers are: Magellan Financial Group (-12.7%) PEXA Group (-5.5%) IGO Ltd (-3.1%) Core Lithium (-2.7%) Neuren Pharmaceuticals (-2.5%)",
