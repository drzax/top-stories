While Bridget is taking you through what we're expecting and what it will all mean for you, I'm trawling through the budget papers with a fine-tooth comb alongside a bunch of my colleagues. You'll hear from me throughout the blog, and I'll be bursting out of the lock-up at 7.30 pm to join you live and tell you everything there is to know about this year's budget."

The government has promised a $14.6 billion cost-of-living relief package, targeting \"the most vulnerable Australians\". Earlier today, Treasurer Jim Chalmers said the relief is \"broader than what has been speculated on.\" Chalmers: It has a number of elements, it won't all be limited by age or by other distinctions.
