Analysis by EY shows the big four posted a combined statutory profit of $32 billion for the past financial year, up $2.4 billion or 8.2% from the previous year. Net interest margins — the gap between what the banks pay to borrow money and the rates they lend it out at — were up 0.11 of a percentage point to 1.85%. Return on equity, a key measure of profitability, climbed 1.25 percentage points to 12%. But KPMG's analysis highlights the difference between the first and second half of the financial year for the big banks. \"The RBA's tightening of monetary policy was the key driver of net interest margins, which increased by an average of 9 basis points on FY22 across the Majors,\" KPMG's report noted. \"The average net interest margin for the Majors was 1.90% in the first half year, which decreased to 1.84% in the second half of FY23. In combination with an increase in interest-earning assets of 7.3 percent compared to FY22, net interest income increased by 13.8 percent to $74.9 billion. \" Margins are however under pressure from both intense pricing competition, particularly in the home loan market, as well as the rising cost of deposit and wholesale funding.\" It's that pressure on profit margins that's seen some of the banks' results, like ANZ's today, poorly received.",

The chair of the Future Fund (and former Howard-era treasurer) Peter Costello is also speaking at the UBS Australasia Conference. Mr Costello says Australia's current levels of immigration (at around 500,000 to 600,000 migrants annually) are \"extremely high\". \"It was about 120,000 [people] back in my day,\" he said. \"This is an enormous adjustment for our economy, and it's no wonder we're seeing rental shortages.\" He also noted that the RBA has identified rent as a significant driver of inflation in the near term. While Mr Costello stressed he was \"pro-immigration\", he said it's important that it needs to be handled in a \"gradualised\" way. Mr Costello was also critical of the Reserve Bank's decision to cut interest rates to near-zero at the height of the pandemic (along with similar decisions by many other central banks worldwide). He said a 0% interest rate is \"corrosive to society\", \"fuels asset booms\", and is a problem for people with \"no assets\". He noted, in the US, it was \"better for Wall Street than main street\" (ie low rates disproportionately favoured the wealthy over the poor and middle class). Mr Costello said the current problem of \"entrenched inflation\" is because central banks did not lift rates again quickly enough — and that monetary policy has \"run its course\" (ie that it is up to governments to take a more active part in managing supply/demand and inflation dynamics).",

In terms of index points, ANZ is the big drag, with the banking giant slumping 3.4% to $24.60 after a $7.1 billion profit result that clearly disappointed investors. ANZ's fall was leading to a 0.7% decline across the financial sector. The other biggest loser on the ASX 200 is TPG Telecom, off 8.4% to $4.99 after the company pulled the plug on discussions with Vocus, which was looking to buy some of its enterprise, government and wholesale assets, including Vision Network. Unlike in the US, Australia's tech sector index was down 0.3%. Utilities, mining and energy were all in the black in early trade. Biggest gains: Elders +10% to $6.80 Boral +6.8% to $5.01 NIB Holdings +4.1% to $7.59 Light and Wonder +2.3% to $134.61 Incitec Pivot +2.2% to $2.965 Biggest losses: TPG Telecom -8.3% to $5 ANZ -3.3% to $24.635 Chalice Mining -2.8% to $1.59 Perseus Mining -2.6% to $1.695 Macquarie Group -2.5% to $158.62",
