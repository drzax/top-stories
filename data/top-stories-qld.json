Israel said its strikes on Tuesday and Wednesday killed two Hamas military leaders in Jabalia, Gaza's biggest refugee camp. Israel said Hamas had command centres and other \"terror infrastructure under, around and within civilian buildings, intentionally endangering Gazan civilians\". Gaza's Hamas-run media office said on Thursday that an estimated 195 Palestinians were killed in the two Israeli attacks on Jabalia, with 120 missing under the rubble. At least 777 people were wounded, Gaza's media office said in a statement. “While we do not yet have estimates of the toll the attack has taken on children, people’s homes have been leveled, hundreds apparently injured and killed, with many children reportedly among the casualties,\" UNICEF said in a statement. “These two attacks follow 25 days of ongoing bombardment that have reportedly resulted in more than 3,500 children killed – not including today’s deaths – and over 6,800 children reportedly injured. \"This would be over 400 children killed or injured per day, for 25 straight days.\" \"This cannot become the new normal.\" As we reported earlier, the United Nations human rights office says it is concerned Israeli air strikes on Gaza's Jabalia refugee camp could amount to war crimes.",

Just down the road from the ABC's Jerusalem bureau is a handwritten sign strung up outside someone's house. In Hebrew it reads: \"First, release the hostages.\" It's a sentiment shared by many people in Israel. Some families of the hostages say they would have preferred that Israel's government negotiates the release of their loved ones before escalating their ground incursion in Gaza. Among those missing are Tal and Adi Shoham, their son Naveh and daughter Yahel. Tal's dad Gilad Korngold says he trusts the Israeli army to make the right decisions, though three weeks into this crisis, he's struggling to hold onto hope. \"There was a lot of hope. Now [there's] less. Every day with no signs from them, it's terrible,\" he said. A military liaison stays in regular contact with Gilad, but he says they came up with an arrangement that helps him get through the night without lying there waiting for the phone to ring. \"He is coming three times a week to my house to talk to us, but we agreed that if something terrible happened, he will not call me up that night.\"",

That's after a Brookfield and EIG led consortium increased their offer to about $9.53 a share for the Australian energy producer. The bidders say it's an 8% increase on their previous offer of $8.81 and a 70% premium to Origin's share price a year ago, before the takeover speculation began. The bid was increased after some major shareholders had indicated they would reject the previous offer. Origin's board is recommending shareholders vote in favour of the deal. But Origins largest shareholder, AustralianSuper, says the offer remains \"substantially below\" its estimate of Origin's long-term value. AustralianSuper manages $300bn in assets. Analysts say if AustralianSuper says no, the deal needs work. \"If Australian Super is rejecting it, the likelihood of the deal going ahead is very low,\" said Jamie Hannah, deputy head of investments and capital markets at VanEck, which owns a 0.3 per cent stake in Origin. \"I think the deal is back at the drawing board at the moment.\"",
