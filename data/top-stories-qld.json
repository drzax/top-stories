However, Colombia has failed to convert despite six attempts at goal. Despite less possession, Morocco has had more entries in the final third, 18, to Colombia’s seven. Colombian teen hero Linda Caicedo has been well-held by Moroccan defender Zineb Redouani on the wing. Caicedo has looked dangerous a couple of times with probing crosses in front of goal. They’ve provided her team with opportunities but the Colombians are yet to capitalise. At just 18, she’s still been exciting to watch. The mostly Colombian crowd has been extremely vocal. Chanting, singing, drumming and celebrations in the stand has created an electric atmosphere at Perth/Boorloo Rectangular Stadium tonight.",
