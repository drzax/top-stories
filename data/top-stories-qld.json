The local share market is likely to begin its day marginally lower (-0.2%) after a quiet session on global markets. Wall Street is closed for the Memorial Day public holiday, while the FTSE isn't trading due to the Bank Holiday in the United Kingdom. The pan-European STOXX 600 index closed 0.1% lower. Some optimism has returned to the market after US President Joe Biden and House Speaker Kevin McCarthy reached a tentative deal to suspend the US debt ceiling for two years, in exchange for spending cuts. However, there are some risks ahead. The deal still needs to be approved by the House of Representatives (controlled by Republicans) and the Senate (which has a Democrat majority). Also, there is no guarantee the House will vote for the agreement, particularly given some far-right Republicans have already expressed their disapproval. There will be a clearer reaction from Wall Street when it reopens for trade tomorrow.",
