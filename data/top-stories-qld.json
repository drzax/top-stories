              "plaintext": "Investors are increasingly concerned about where their money is going, in terms of being ethically conscious, ASIC's deputy chair Sarah Court has told senior business correspondent Peter Ryan. The corporate regulator has brought a Federal Court case against Vanguard for alleged 'greenwashing', or misleading investors about the environmental, social, and corporate governance screening applied to their investments. The case centres on a particular Vanguard fund, after the company identified and reported a breach in its product disclosure statement to ASIC. Here's more of what Sarah Court had to say: \"What we're really concerned about here was screening that was purported to exclude any bonds from this investment fund that had significant business activities in fossil fuels. \"And the significance of this case from ASIC's perspective is that we allege, firstly, that there were large numbers of these bonds in the fund that were actually not researched or screened at all. \"And then furthermore, that at one particular time that we're concerned about, there were a number of bonds being invested in from issuers that we say did have significant business activities in fossil fuels, names like Chevron Phillips, Newcastle Coal, the Korean National Oil Corporation and a number of others.\" Vanguard says it's cooperated with ASIC. The regulator is seeking civil penalties. \"We acknowledged the self report and we took that, investigated and we were sufficiently concerned with the extent of the conduct and the representations that were made that were determined to take court action on this occasion,\" Ms Court said.

              "plaintext": "Australians became a little more optimistic about their finances last week, pushing consumer confidence very slightly higher, according to the ANZ-Roy Morgan weekly index. But the 2.6 point increase to 75.2 points still leaves the index well below the average since 1990, which is 111.1. ANZ senior economist Adelaide Timbrell says that still leaves confidence stuck at recessionary levels. \"The average confidence level was at its highest since the first week of June but has now stayed below the 80 mark for 21 weeks — one week shy of the record in the 1990–91 recession ,\" she noted. Renters drove the bounce in confidence, perhaps on reports that the surge in rents seen over the past year or so might be about to ease. However, despite a very small uptick, those paying off a mortgage remain most pessimistic, with a confidence reading around 68 points. Weekly inflation expectations eased 0.2 of a percentage point to 5.4%. Official figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics, out tomorrow, are expected to show that consumer prices rose an average of about 6% over the year to June.",

The major miners are leading the charge, with BHP up 2.1 per cent and Fortescue gaining more than 3 per cent, putting both among the top 10 performers in early trade. Energy stocks are also on the rise thanks to a boost from an overnight rise in crude oil prices.
