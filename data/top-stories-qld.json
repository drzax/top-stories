The Olympic gold medalist said if a new host was not found for the Games, it would be particularly challenging for less established athletes who use the Games as a springboard for their careers. \"The immediate priority of the Australian Sports Commission is to ensure that our athletes, coaches, high performance and support staff are supported ,\" he said. He said finding an alternative host would be a challenge. \"To be able to put it together is going to be quite a significant task, and I think this is going to be a very big test for the Commonwealth Games Federation, \" he said. Responding to a question about whether the public sees hosting major sporting events as value for money in terms of positive impacts, Perkins said it needed to be an ongoing conversation. \"There is definitely a conversation to be had with the community at large to explain what those impacts are, how they're actually deployed and ... whether it does have a broader community benefit,\" he said. \"Where large portions of the population don't see that benefit, it probably does ask questions of us of how exactly are we actually deploying the resources that we receive?\"",

He said WA had looked at hosting the Games previously but couldn't get the numbers to stack up, describing it as a \"sugar hit\". \"The Commonwealth Games aren't what they used to be, and as a result of that they don't provide the return on investment ,\" he said. \"They're highly expensive and while they attract people for a 12-day sporting festival they don't provide sustained growth and sustained outcomes in terms of the economy.\" He said he may be open to the idea of co-hosting the event with other cities, in the same way as the FIFA Women's World Cup is being held. Perth Lord Mayor Basil Zempilas disagrees with the premier, and thinks Western Australia should pounce on the opportunity to host the games. \"This is a market for a host city to go to the Commonwealth Games Federation and say, 'Here are our venues, here's how much we can spend, you make your Commonwealth Games fit around us',\" he said. Zempilas said he believes investing in being a host city would spur on development that would benefit a city down the road. \"What a 2026 Commonwealth Games in Perth could do is deliver social and affordable housing,\" he said. Ron Alexander, the former of director-general of WA's Department of Sport and Recreation, has called for the state government to publicise the cost involved. \"It doesn't stack up. Why don't they release the figures so that the West Australian public can make up their own minds?\"",
