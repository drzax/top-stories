Mr Speirs urged people to \"remain respectful and decent\" during the voting process. \"This is an important part of democracy and we ought to respect it and respect each other's views,\" he said. Mr Speirs said South Australians he had spoken to were \"confused\" about the Voice. \"They're really concerned about the serious lack of detail that has been put on the table by the prime minister. And the prime minister is going to have a lot of questions to answer on Sunday morning if, as predicted, the referendum is defeated across Australia,\" he said. Ms Liddle, an Arrernte woman, said people should focus on the facts when they make their decision, not emotion. \"It is about a whole new chapter in our constitution, in our nation's rulebook, and anything you do to our rulebook has consequences,\" she said. \"That's why Australians have been very careful historically in making any change to our rulebook — and they should be. \"And they should be really careful on this one too, because they shouldn't be voting on emotion. \"They shouldn't be voting because they feel like they're being intimidated, harassed, or ashamed or guilted. None of those things should come into play here.\"",
