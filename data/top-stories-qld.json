Speaking to RN's Patricia Karvelas Mr Wyatt said he was \"disappointed\" with the Mr Dutton's behavior in the lead up to the referendum. \"I’m disappointed because Peter was part of the process, he had access to the information and he never had a serious discussion with me on the voice,\" he said. The arguments that he’s putting forward are not factual, they’re contentious in order to create fear and division and they are intentional in order to sink the voice.\" Mr Wyatt agreed that much of the Liberal party's Voice messaging is 'Trumpian'. \"Some of the tactics are copybook out of America. The fake news, the statements of ‘You’ll end up paying Aboriginal people’, ‘You’ll lose land’, ‘You won’t be able to do this’. That concerns me,\" Mr Wyatt said. Listen to the full interview below.",

Ms Wong also stressed the importance of \"calm leadership\" and bringing Australians together, rather than create division. \"It is time for all of us to say we stand against all hatred, all prejudice. There is no place for anti-Semitism, as there is no place for discrimination and prejudice of any kind. It is a time for us to come together. \"We know this is distressing for the Jewish community. We know there are many in Australia who have very strong views about the Palestinian aspirations and I would say this — one of the great tragedies, apart from the horrific nature of Hamas' actions, one of the great tragedies of what they have done is they have pushed further away the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinian people.\"",
