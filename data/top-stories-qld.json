Incredibly that was the first time Nadeshiko Japan have kept consecutive clean sheets at a World Cup in 35 matches. Japan has a whopping 24 shots in that game, 12 on target, so will they be a bit frustrated that they could only score two? Perhaps. But it's not goals that they needed tonight, just the three points. You'd think Spain will provide a sterner test next time out when they meet in Wellington/Ta Whanganui-a-Tara on Monday, but that's a then problem. For Costa Rica though, that's a second-straight defeat that essentially puts them out of the tournament.",
