After an aggressive hiking cycle that took rates to a 14-year high, the central bank has now sat on its hands since May's rate rise. Here's what the RBNZ monetary policy committee had to say about the decision: The current level of interest rates is constraining spending and hence inflation pressure, as anticipated and required. The Committee agreed that the [official cash rate] needs to stay at restrictive levels for the foreseeable future to ensure annual consumer price inflation returns to the 1 to 3% target range, while supporting maximum sustainable employment. The New Zealand economy is evolving broadly as anticipated. Activity continues to slow in parts of the economy that are more sensitive to interest rates. Labour shortages are easing as overall demand softens and immigration adds to labour resources. Headline inflation and inflation expectations have declined, but measures of core inflation remain too high.

Developer and landlord Mirvac has swung to a $165 million loss in financial year 2023, down from a $906 million profit the year before. The loss has been driven by write-downs in the value of its office (-5.6 per cent ) and retail (-5.3 per cent ) property portfolios, partly offset by a +6.2 per cent revaluation of its industrial properties. The company also sold off about $500 million of \"non-core\" assets at a 2 per cent discount to their book values, excluding the cost of the sales. Mirvac said it would continue to increase its exposure to residential and industrial real estate, while reducing the share of office space on its books, as the persistence of working from home dents demand in that sector. Excluding one-off costs, the company's \"operating profit\" dropped 3 per cent to $580 million. It will pay a 5.3 cent per share final dividend .",
