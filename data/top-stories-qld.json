Japan has a whopping 24 shots in that game, 12 on target, so will they be a bit frustrated that they could only score two? Perhaps. But it's not goals that they needed tonight, just the three points. You'd think Spain will provide a sterner test next time out when they meet in Wellington/Ta Whanganui-a-Tara on Monday, but that's a then problem. For Costa Rica though, that's a second-straight defeat that essentially puts them out of the tournament.",

Online retailer Kogan (+10 per cent) surged to a 17 month high, despite plunging sales and an expected full-year loss, after saying profitability had improved over the second half of the financial year. Shipbuilder Austal (-10.5%) tanked after warning of a potential loss because of problems with its ship building program in the US. Join us tomorrow when the US Federal Reserve is expected to raise interest rates overnight by another 0.25 per cent. I will leave you with the best and worst performers on the ASX 200 index.",

Iron ore, copper and aluminium prices fell leading to a $US3.3 billion drop in earnings, although the bottom line was helped by increased iron ore sales. Iron ore prices fell by an average of 14 per cent and copper prices were 10 per cent lower over the half.

That's after the rate of inflation dropped from the March quarter to the June quarter as the price of petrol, electricity and domestic travel fell. However rents saw their biggest quarterly rise since 1988. The annual pace of inflation slowed to 6 per cent from 7 per cent. The ASX 200 index rose 0.9 per cent to a five month high with most sectors boosted by rate pause hopes. Banks, consumer firms, energy and technology all gained, although real estate stocks fell. Miners jumped after China promised more stimulus. The Australian dollar dropped 0.4 per cent to 67.63 US cents on the prospect the RBA will keep rates steady at 4.1 per cent next week. For a wrap up of the inflation figures, here's my colleagues Michael Janda and Rachel Puppazoni.",
