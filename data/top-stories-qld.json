No, Ukraine's counteroffensive has not depended on the move by Yevgeny Prigozhin in Russia. I don't think the leaders in Kyiv would have minded watching their invaders fight among themselves, but their counteroffensive would have carried on even if it didn't happen. Prigozhin's mutiny was a distraction for Russia's leaders and that may have opened up some opportunities for Ukraine in the field, but as you say, it was over very quickly. Two days after the aborted march on Moscow, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said: \"Today in all sectors, our soldiers made advances. It is a happy day.\" But as Mick Ryan warned earlier in the week, there is the potential that the instability in Russia and Prigozhin's questioning of military strategy leads Putin to double down and target vulnerable citizens and infrastructure inside Ukraine.",

              "plaintext": "Are Russians truly oblivious to wards the death of their men sent to the front line in Ukraine? - Andrew Hi Andrew, Thanks for your question. There are so many factors feeding into the awareness and understanding of Vladimir Putin's war inside his own country. And of course much of that is by his design. Yes, there is a propaganda machine at work that is not reporting death tolls widely or accurately, but there are other dynamics too. Earlier in the year, Western officials said it was likely 200,000 Russians had been injured or killed in the war, with at least 40,000 killed. At the time, the analysis was that Vladimir Putin's support could probably sustain that. And when the partial mobilisation happened in September, we learnt that it targeted ethnic minorities in disadvantaged regions - hardly the centres of the President's power base. So while some Russians are likely oblivious, I don't think that can be said for everyone. I think there are some regions and communities disproportionately impacted who will have buried many of their sons. But in Moscow and St Petersburg, I think there is more tolerance for the deaths because they appear as a number on a page. I wrote about the communities impacted by the mobilisation last year:",

The strongest private army and loudest critic of the Kremlin were eliminated, didn’t it play out like Putin would have hoped a potential coup might go? - Marc Hi Marc, thanks for writing in. I've put your question to military strategist Mick Ryan, who writes: The coup ultimately has not made Putin stronger. While it might have removed Wagner as a threat (for now) the weekend was not about overthrowing Putin but more about a cry for help from Prigozhin. That said, the slow reaction of Putin and the security authorities has damaged Putin’s standing and revealed what many Russian experts have been describing for some time as a brittleness in the Russian system. For a far better analysis than I could ever provide, I recommend Peter Tesch’s latest article at the ASPI Strategist. Peter has been, and remains, a superb servant of our nation, was our ambassador to Moscow, and is a very deep and broad expert on Russia issues.",

Property analysts CoreLogic says the rate of loss-making home sales rose over the first three months of the year as home prices decreased. However, the vast majority of homes still made a profit on their resale with a median nominal gain of $276,500 nationally. The median loss was $40,000. CoreLogic's Pain & Gain report found the percentage of dwellings that made a gain on their resale declined for the third quarter in a row to 92.3 per cent from a high of 94.2 per cent over the three months to May 2022. And an increasing number of homes sold had been owned for less than two years. Here's Eliza Owen, head of research at CoreLogic: “Such short selling times that involve sellers incurring a loss may be considered unusual, because  hold periods typically increase during housing value downturns, as sellers try to avoid making a loss,”  Ms Owen says. “The implication may be that some sellers are choosing to incur a loss from resale in order to avoid  particularly high mortgage repayments in the current rate-hiking environment.\" Profit making sales were highest in Hobart, Canberra and Adelaide. Darwin, Perth, Sydney and Melbourne saw an increase in loss making sales, with 10.7 per cent of sales in Sydney making a loss over the March quarter. Nearly 30 per cent of homes were sold at a loss in Darwin.",
