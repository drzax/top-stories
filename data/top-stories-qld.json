Economists had predicted a relatively small lift to occur in the numbers. So what was behind the change? Markets economist at NAB, Taylor Nugent, notes that the surprise fall could be for a couple of reasons. \"The figures could have been distorted by holiday factors, coming a week before Labour Day, and Hurricane Idalia – where the usual reaction after a natural disaster is lower claims initially, followed by a jump,\" he said in a morning note. This most recent fall marks the fourth straight weekly decline in US jobless claims, and comes after the US Labor Department last week said jobs growth had picked up in August. All in all, the data suggests the US job market remains relatively tight, despite other figures indicating it has started to soften.",
