Put simply, it's a measure of how workers' base pay is changing, and excludes the effect of boosts like bonuses, overtime, hours worked, promotions or shifting jobs/employers. It's the change in how much people are getting paid per hour for doing the same job for the same employer, and thus pretty much akin to the inflation rate for wages. It's important for the RBA for two reasons. The first is that higher pay rises mean households have more money to spend, which means more demand and that generally keeps consumer price inflation higher â businesses have no reason to cut prices if people are still buying their goods or services. The second is that wages are a large input cost for most businesses, the largest for many. This is especially so in the services sector, where the most recent inflation figures showed an acceleration in price rises. If wages rise too fast, the RBA is concerned businesses will pass through those increased costs, sending inflation higher still. The good news (or bad news if you desperately need a pay rise to keep up with your mortgage/rent/grocery bills) is that there's been few signs of wages across the board rising particularly fast. The economist forecasts for today's WPI centre on pay rises of 0.9% over the March quarter and 3.6% over the past year, up from 0.8% and 3.3% in the December quarter reading. Given that consumer price inflation was 7% over the March quarter, workers are still expected to be taking a big real pay cut, but at least they're not contributing much to inflation in Australia.",
