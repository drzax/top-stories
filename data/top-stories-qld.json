On its website, Active Super claimed not to invest in industries that threatened the environment and the community — meaning it didn't invest funds in tobacco manufacturing, gambling, coal mining and oil tar sands. The super fund also said it added Russia to its list of excluded countries after it illegally invaded Ukraine last year. But ASIC alleges Active Super \"exposed its members to investments it claimed to restrict or eliminate\", claiming it had 28 holdings, directly or indirectly, that contradicted its ethical stance, between February 1, 2021 and June 30, 2023. Those holdings included: Gambling : Skycity Entertainment Group Limited, PointsBet Holdings Limited, The Star Entertainment Group Limited, The Lottery Corporation Limited and Tabcorp Holdings Limited; Tobacco : Amcor PLC; Russian entities : Gazprom PJSC and Rosneft Oil Company; Oil Tar Sands : ConocoPhillips; Coal Mining : Coronado Global Resources Inc., New Hope Corporation Limited and Whitehaven Coal Limited. ASIC also alleges Active Super claimed it would stop investing in Russian companies from May 2022, but holdings in Russian securities remained in place as of the end of June 2023. \"There is much competition among super funds for new members, and we know that funds seek to attract members with promises their investments will not be exposed to certain industries,\" said Sarah Court, ASIC's Deputy Chair. \"When making these claims super funds must have evidence to back their claims and ensure they are not promising exclusions that they cannot guarantee.\" It's the third greenwashing civil penalty ASIC has launched, after taking action against Mercer Super and Vanguard. A spokesperson for Active Super said the fund has cooperated with ASIC's investigation, and \" welcomes increased scrutiny on ESG disclosure standards as being good for members, the super industry and the community\". \"As the matter is before the courts we are unable to comment further,\" the spokesperson said.",
