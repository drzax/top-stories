Economist Adam Boyton says this is a more mixed labour force survey than the headline 64.9k gain in employment suggests. \"In particular, the unemployment rate holding at 3.7%, the vast bulk of jobs growth being part time, and hours worked falling in the month takes the gloss off the impressive headline jobs print. So despite the jump in headline employment we are left thinking the August labour force survey in its entirety isn't too different from our broad expectations. Yes, the labour market is still very solid but slack is creeping in (witness the increase in the underemployment rate to 6.6% in August from 6.4% in July).\" He note, in the past six months employment has risen by an average of 37.8k a month, that's well below the rate of population growth. Part-time employment increased 62.1k, while full-time rose 2.8k in the month. ANZ thinks the Reserve Bank won't change the cash rate \"for quite some time\".",
