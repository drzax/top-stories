On Saturday, Australians will be asked whether they support enshrining the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Voice in the constitution. The majority of polls suggest the referendum will not be successful. Noel Pearson, who is one of the architects of the Uluru Statement of the Heart, which put forward the Voice to Parliament, says that outcome would be disappointing. \"This is a moral choice for the country, not just a question of constitutional law,\" he told AM. \"The choice we have is not equivalent - Yes and No are not equivalent choices. \"Yes is of a different quality to No. No would be a travesty for the country.\" You can listen to the full interview on AM with Sabra Lane by taping the link below.",

              "plaintext": "The Senate committee examining the Commonwealth Bilateral Air Service Agreements has delivered its final report this afternoon, finding \"clear evidence\" of the \"aggressive use of market power by Qantas\" over the federal government's decision to reject additional flights by Qatar Airways. The Senate committee was established last month in response to the federal government's decision to reject a request for Qatar Airways that would see 28 additional weekly flights added to their schedule, with Transport Minister Catherine King saying the decision was made in the \"national interest\". The committee has made 10 recommendations, including that the competition watchdog reinstate its monitoring of domestic airlines, and the federal government \"immediately review\" the decision. Committee chair and Nationals Senator Bridget McKenzie said the report contained strong recommendations that would ultimately benefit Australians with cheaper airfares. \"At a time of a cost-of-living crisis in Australia the Government has made decisions that have protected Qantas' market share and kept the cost of airfares higher for Australian families and exporters, and they have delayed making critical decisions to improve the reliability of domestic travel especially at Sydney Airport,\" Senator McKenzie said. \"The committee heard evidence that Australians could have been enjoying cheaper flights to Europe and the Middle East as early as April this year had the Government approved additional Qatar Airways flights, and that Turkish Airlines had planned to offer additional flights in time for families to reunite overseas this Christmas. \"Clear evidence was provided of the aggressive use of market power by Qantas and the committee has called for reinstatement of Australian Competition and Consumer Commission monitoring of the domestic airline industry and for the competition watchdog to inquire into anti-competitive behaviour in the sector .\"",

Members of the Community and Public Sector Union (CPSU) will strike for 24 hours from today seeking a better pay offer. The union has rejected the federal government's revised pay offer of 11.2% over three years, saying it doesn't match cost-of-living pressures. \"There are very real cost-of-living pressures on workers right across the economy, and the public sector is no different, \" said CPSU national secretary Melissa Donnelly. \"The Albanese Labor government can and should do better on pay for its own workforce.\" Ms Donnelly said she expects the strike will impact services like Centrelink. \"It is unfortunately likely to have some impact on services across the Services Australia network ,\" she said. \"Be it customers contacting the smart centres, that is the call centres, or people attending in face in service centres.\" Services Australia is encouraging those who need to access their services and can't delay while the strike is taking place to use self-service: For more about the Services Australia strike, you can read the below analysis from the ABC's Markus Mannheim — he's taken a look at employment data and to try and assess just how much public servants are actually worth.",
