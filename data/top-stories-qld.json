The best and worst performers remained fairly consistent through the day — materials led the charge, with a good showing by the major miners, particularly Fortescue (+4.3%). The big banks also helped boost the market, led by a 1.3 per cent gain for Westpac. CSL was the worst-performing individual stock on the benchmark index, as its guidance for the next financial year disappointed. Around the region, Tokyo's Nikkei 225 has been the strongest performer, gaining around 1.5 per cent — hitting a fresh three-decade high during the session. The Australian dollar remains around 67.7 US cents. The ANZ-Roy Morgan weekly survey showed consumer confidence dropping to a three-year low, as the 'time to buy a major household item' reading plunged. \"Consumer confidence fell to its lowest since April 2020 and was among the four weakest results since the pandemic,\" ANZ senior economist Adelaide Timbrell wrote. Tomorrow, we'll get a key piece of local economic data with jobs figures for May. Economists polled by Reuters expect the unemployment rate to hold steady at 3.7 per cen t, with around 15,000 jobs added. And we'll also have the Federal Reserve's decision on interest rates before our market opens, so join us back on this blog bright and early tomorrow for all the overnight market reaction — set your alarms (if you want!).",

APRA requires the banks to add 3 per cent on top of current rates when carrying out a serviceability assessment on customers taking out or refinancing a loan. That's to make sure borrowers can still make their repayments even if interest rates rise, and with the cash rate now 4 per cent above where it was last April, borrowers assessed during the low rate period are now potentially paying rates well above the buffer. Given variable rates are pushing up over 3 per cent, borrowers are being assessed on their ability to repay with rates over 9 per cent — making it a much steeper hurdle to clear and limiting the options many have. At its quarterly meeting, the Council — which includes members from the RBA, ASIC, APRA and Treasury —said it would continue to closely monitor how lenders are supporting customers experiencing financial hardship, as households experience increased pressure. The Council recognised that some borrowers were facing challenges in refinancing their existing loan with another lender because of a range of difficulties, including in meeting the serviceability criteria that lenders use. APRA's prudential framework does not prohibit banks from lending to these borrowers, although APRA expects that banks will set prudent limits for their exceptions to lending policy and monitor such lending closely. Council members supported APRA's assessment that the serviceability buffer — currently set at 3 per cent — remains at the appropriate level given the current environment, including the high degree of uncertainty and risks to the economic outlook. The Council noted that APRA would continue to assess the appropriateness of macroprudential policy settings as economic and financial conditions evolve.",
