The S & P 500 ended modestly lower, while a host of interest-rate-sensitive momentum stocks, many of which are slated to post third-quarter results this week, buoyed the tech-laded Nasdaq Composite Index to a higher close. The Dow Jones Industrial Average notched its fourth-straight daily drop. \"The story continues to be about interest rates, and to some extent switching from 'higher for longer' to 'how much higher for how much longer?'\" said Oliver Pursche, senior vice-president at Wealthspire Advisors in New York. \"The market has accepted the idea that the Fed is not going to lower rates anytime soon.\" The tech-heavy Nasdaq racked up the largest gains among Wall Street's major indexes, while the blue-chip Dow was nominally lower. The week ahead promises to be eventful for earnings, with reports by nearly one-third of the companies in the S & P 500. These include megacap momentum drivers, including Microsoft, Alphabet, Meta and Amazon, along with heavy-hitting industrials such as General Motors, Ford Motor and Boeing. \"With nearly a third of the S & P reporting this week, investors are hoping these 'magnificent seven' companies will end up surprising to the upside,\" said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist of CFRA Research in New York. So far, 86 of the companies in the S & P 500 have posted earnings. Of those, 78% have beaten expectations, LSEG data showed. Analysts see aggregate S & P 500 earnings for the July-September period growing 1.2 per cent year-on-year, slightly below the 1.6 per cent growth projected at the start of the month, according to LSEG.",
