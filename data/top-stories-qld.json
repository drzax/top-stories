She unpacked the intensifying \"global selloff\" we've been seeing thanks to the Fed's latest minutes, where it mentioned that it still sees significant risks to inflation. But she's pointed out that the US Treasury has been printing a lot of T bills lately and fell behind government bond issuance, and will eventually result in Treasury shifting back to bonds — which poses a threat to sovereign yields. \"The increasing supply, and the decreasing demand for US sovereigns will be one major force pushing the US yield curve higher. And if the strong economic data translates into higher inflation, the impact on yields will likely be higher,\" she wrote. The impact of a higher US yield? A stronger US dollar. \" A stronger US dollar is inflationary for the rest of the world ,\" she wrote. \"If nothing, the energy and raw material prices that are negotiated in USD terms on international markets simply become more expensive when imports are reverted back to local currencies, and that, alone, is enough to push inflation higher in the rest of the world when the US dollar appreciates. \"The EURUSD fell to 1.0856, the AUDUSD slipped below 64 cents and the USDJPY spiked above 146.50. \"The correction is in play ... and we could see the US dollar retreat further into the weekly closing bell, but the stronger dollar trend is clearly in play and it is worrying. \"",

Iron ore futures are trading up on China's Dalian Commodity Exchange, and it's the seventh session in a row they've been edging higher. The reason? It's got to do with the fact China's steelmakers haven't cut production yet, despite the concerns that remain around long-term demand. \"Iron ore prices were up strongly on the back of news that steel mills in Hebei have not yet implemented production cuts,\"  NAB said in a note. The bank also said it was staying cautious on the 2023 outlook, as China steel production is expected to be capped at 2022 levels. Meanwhile, ANZ mentioned ina note that falling exports from Australia and Brazil have also squeezed iron ore inventories in China.",

There's brewing concerns about demand growth in China as its economy slows, coupled with fears about US rates staying higher for longe r. Both the major benchmarks for West Texas Intermediate crude and Brent crude are fairly flat, with the US Federal Reserve's focus on containing inflation alongside stronger-than-expected economic data keeping the prices mostly contained. Reuters reports that investors are concerned that should the Fed leave rates higher for longer, those higher borrowing costs could stifle economic growth, and reduce overall demand — including for oil. On top of the US concerns, China's sputtering economy has added to contagion fears, which has only added to oil concerns, as it's the world's second-largest oil consumer. Back in July, China made a very rare draw on its crude oil inventories, which was the first time in 33 months it dipped into its storage, while US crude oil inventories fell by almost 6 million barrels last week.",
