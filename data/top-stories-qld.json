Reports from Bloomberg suggest that a private equity firm backed by the parent company that owns the German sandal maker is considering strategic options — and that includes an initial public offering (or IPO, if you're up with the lingo). L Catterton, which is a private equity firm backed by LVMH (a mammoth corporation behind major luxury brands), is working with advisers on potentially listing Birkenstock in the US. Discussions are ongoing, and the deal may not proceed, but Bloomberg's reporting suggests Birkenstock could be valued at more than $US6 billion ($9 billion). Birkenstock sold a majority stake to L Catterton in 2021, with the deal at the time valuing the sandal maker at $US4.35 billion ($6.5 billion). L Catterton has declined to comment on the reports, and at the time of writing this, LVMH and Birkenstock haven't responded to requests for comment from Reuters.",

After launching a day ago, more than 30 million users have signed up to Threads — including our PM Anthony Albanese — which is set to rival Elon Musk's Twitter. Semafor's report cited a letter sent to Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg by Twitter's lawyer Alex Spiro, which accused Meta of hiring ex-Twitter employees. The report says those Twitter employees \"had and continue to have access to Twitter's trade secrets and other highly confidential information\". \"Twitter intends to strictly enforce its intellectual property rights, and demands that Meta take immediate steps to stop using any Twitter trade secrets or other highly confidential information,\" Spiro wrote in the letter. But that suggestion has been dismissed by Meta spokesperson Andy Stone, in a statement posted to Threads (of course). \"No one on the Threads engineering team is a former Twitter employee — that’s just not a thing,\" he said. So what's Elon Musk's response been? I'll let this tweet speak for itself. While we're on this topic, were you one of the 30 million early adopters who signed up for Threads yesterday, or are you selective with your social media platforms?

Let's cut right to the chase — overnight, Wall Street's big three indices all finished lower, stoked by market fears another rate hike is on the way. Although those fears have been hovering around all week, investors are jittery after US labour market data showed there was only a moderate increase to the number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits, all the while private payrolls rose. That points to a labour market that remains on steady footing, despite the growing risks of a recession in the US. Not only that, but the report suggested that those workers who were recently laid off aren't remaining unemployed for long — they're finding new work in a shorter time frame. The data also showed more people are quitting their jobs, which is a telltale sign of confidence in the labour market. The upshot? It makes it all the more likely the Federal Reserve will lift interest rates at its meeting this month, after pressing the pause button in June. But the data doesn't stop there — the full US employment report drops tonight. Back home, the ASX is looking unlikely to recoup its losses from trading yesterday. Futures are down, and based on Wall Street's drops from overnight, things aren't looking too rosy for the local market. Grab a coffee, settle in, and let's see how the trading day unfolds.",
