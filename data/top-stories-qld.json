The Hamas-run Gaza health ministry says people are unable to leave, as the encirclement of the hospital by Israeli troops makes it too dangerous, Middle East correspondent Allyson Horn reports. Watch the full report below: \"Hamas says that Israeli tanks are at the gates of Al-Shifa and there has been heavy gun battles around the vicinity between Israeli troops and Hamas militants,\" she said. \"Because they say they cannot leave, the Hamas-run ministry of health says that now doctors are having to dig mass graves in the vicinity of the hospital to bury those people that have died over the last few days.\" About 600 patients and 5,000 civilians are stuck sheltering inside the hospital, according to the ministry. Israel claims that Hamas uses the hospital as a shield for military operations, which Hamas and the hospital leadership have denied. The World Health Organization has said that Al-Shifa has stopped functioning as a hospital and that the situation there is perilous.",
