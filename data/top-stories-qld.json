August 25 represents the 56 days from the beginning of the new financial year, which is the number of days women must work to earn the same as men did last year, on average. \"The 56 extra days that women have to work to earn the same, on average, as men, shows us that these barriers are still significant in Australian workplaces,\" Workplace Gender Equality Agency CEO Mary Wooldridge said. \"It means that women are missing out on 13 cents, on average, for every $1 that a man makes. \"Currently at 13%, the gender pay gap in Australia is a persistent and pervasive issue that undermines women’s earnings .\" So what can be done? The WGEA, which is an agency of the federal government, says today is a reminder that employers need to \"eliminate the barriers of bias, discrimination and entrenched gender stereotypes tha t devalue women and their work and drive the gender pay gap\". \"Today’s Equal Pay Day is a call to action for all employers to build on this moment by taking the time to find out what steps they need to take to support greater gender equality in their own workplace,\" Ms Wooldridge said. From next year, the WGEA will publish the gender pay gap for employers that have 100 or more workers in Australia, which it says will help tackle gender inequality through \"increased transparency and action\".",

That's because its production outlook for the coming year is lower than what was expected, with the miner expecting to produce between 660-690,000 tonnes of spodumene concentrate in the next financial year. Forecasts expected that range to be upwards of 700,000 tonnes — and it's that shortfall that's seen it's share price slide into the red. But the miner says the long-term outlook remains \"very positive\" for lithium. As of 12:30pm AEST, Pilbara shares were down 7.1% to $4.75 .",
