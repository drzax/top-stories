Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA) were $383 million, down from $427 million in the previous corresponding period. Net profit after tax (NPAT) was $200 million, down from $246 million in the first half of 2022. Grancorp lifted its full year guidance: EBITDA of $500- $560 million, up from $470- $530 million. NPAT of $220- $260 million, up from $180- 220 million. GrainCorp's Managing Director and Chief Executive Robert Spurway said there was ongoing demand for Australian grain and oilseeds, supported by a bumper third crop on the east coast. \"GrainCorp's export program ran at close to full capacity with 4.4mmt of grain and oilseeds exported during the half,\" Mr Spurway said. \"Export supply chain margins remained solid, albeit not at the levels we saw last year.\" The company also acknowledged the death of a worker in a fatal truck accident in April at the Graincorp receival site in Moree, New South Wales."

                  "headline": "Wall street mixed on CPI data and debt ceiling worries",
                  "articleBody": "Here's some detail about how the US markets ended up overnight: The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 30.48 points, or 0.09 per cent, to 33,531. The S & P 500 gained 18.47 points, or 0.4 per cent, at 4,137, while the Nasdaq Composite added 126.89 points, or 1 per cent, at 12,306. The Nasdaq was helped by a 4.1 per cent climb in Google's parent company Alphabet as the company rolled out more artificial intelligence for its core search product in response to competition from Microsoft Corp. Large-cap tech stocks including Apple Inc and Microsoft also gained 1.04 per cent and 1.73 per cent, respectively. The rate-sensitive S & P 500 technology sector index went up 1.2 per cent and the communication services rose 1.69 per cent. Markets reacted positively because they saw the inflation data as a small positive, with hopes rising of a rate pause. \"The CPI is indicating some sort of relief in inflationary pressure. That would mean the Fed would be toward the end or already at the end of its interest rate cycle, and growth companies are most heavily affected by higher interest rates,\" Kevin W. Philip, a partner at investment advisor Bel Air said. Fed funds futures traders are pricing in a pause in rate increases at the central bank's June meeting, and less than a 5 per cent chance of another 25 basis point hike. However, investors also had concerns about the looming US debt ceiling. Talks on raising the US federal government's $US31.4 trillion debt ceiling entered a new phase on Wednesday as some areas of potential compromise emerged after Tuesday's White House meeting. Regional bank shares extended declines from volatile sessions last week on concerns about the sector's health. PacWest Bancorp fell 0.5 per cent, and Zions Bancorporation fell 2.7 per cent respectively. Oil and gas producer Occidental Petroleum Corp fell 3.6 per cent after its first-quarter earnings fell short of analysts' estimates. Livent Corp rose 5.2 per cent after Australian lithium miner Allkem Ltd agreed to merge with the US-based chemical manufacturing firm to create a $US10.6 billion firm. Airbnb Inc 10.9 per cent as the vacation rental booking company had fewer bookings and lower average daily rates in the second quarter. Rivian Automotive jumped 1.8 per cent after the electrical vehicle maker beat estimates for its first-quarter results and reiterated its annual production forecast. - with Reuters"

The Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 0.4 per cent last month after gaining 0.1 per cent in March. The increase was in line with economists' expectations, according to Reuters. Stubbornly high rents accounted for much of the increase in inflation. However, there were pockets of relief for consumers. Food prices were unchanged for a second straight month. Grocery store prices fell 0.2 per cent after decreasing 0.3 per cent in March, posting back-to-back declines for the first time since July 2019. Fruits and vegetables, meat, fish and eggs were cheaper compared to March. Milk prices dropped 2 per cent. Natural gas prices tumbled 4.9 per cent and the cost of electricity dropped for the second straight month, blunting some of the 3 per cent jump in gasoline prices, which followed a 4.6 per cent plunge in March. The rebound came after Saudi Arabia and other OPEC+ oil producers announced further oil output cuts. Annual inflation increased 4.9 per cent, which was the smallest yearly rise since April 2021. - with Reuters"

Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA) were $383 million, down from $427 million in the previous corresponding period. Net profit after tax (NPAT) was $200 million, down from $246 million in the first half of 2022. Grancorp lifted its full year guidance: EBITDA of $500- $560 million, up from $470- $530 million. NPAT of $220- $260 million, up from $180- 220 million. GrainCorp's Managing Director and Chief Executive Robert Spurway said there was ongoing demand for Australian grain and oilseeds, supported by a bumper third crop on the east coast. \"GrainCorp's export program ran at close to full capacity with 4.4mmt of grain and oilseeds exported during the half,\" Mr Spurway said. \"Export supply chain margins remained solid, albeit not at the levels we saw last year.\" The company also acknowledged the death of a worker in a fatal truck accident in April at the Graincorp receival site in Moree, New South Wales.",

The S & P 500 gained 18.47 points, or 0.4 per cent, at 4,137, while the Nasdaq Composite added 126.89 points, or 1 per cent, at 12,306. The Nasdaq was helped by a 4.1 per cent climb in Google's parent company Alphabet as the company rolled out more artificial intelligence for its core search product in response to competition from Microsoft Corp. Large-cap tech stocks including Apple Inc and Microsoft also gained 1.04 per cent and 1.73 per cent, respectively. The rate-sensitive S & P 500 technology sector index went up 1.2 per cent and the communication services rose 1.69 per cent. Markets reacted positively because they saw the inflation data as a small positive, with hopes rising of a rate pause. \"The CPI is indicating some sort of relief in inflationary pressure. That would mean the Fed would be toward the end or already at the end of its interest rate cycle, and growth companies are most heavily affected by higher interest rates,\" Kevin W. Philip, a partner at investment advisor Bel Air said. Fed funds futures traders are pricing in a pause in rate increases at the central bank's June meeting, and less than a 5 per cent chance of another 25 basis point hike. However, investors also had concerns about the looming US debt ceiling. Talks on raising the US federal government's $US31.4 trillion debt ceiling entered a new phase on Wednesday as some areas of potential compromise emerged after Tuesday's White House meeting. Regional bank shares extended declines from volatile sessions last week on concerns about the sector's health. PacWest Bancorp fell 0.5 per cent, and Zions Bancorporation fell 2.7 per cent respectively. Oil and gas producer Occidental Petroleum Corp fell 3.6 per cent after its first-quarter earnings fell short of analysts' estimates. Livent Corp rose 5.2 per cent after Australian lithium miner Allkem Ltd agreed to merge with the US-based chemical manufacturing firm to create a $US10.6 billion firm. Airbnb Inc 10.9 per cent as the vacation rental booking company had fewer bookings and lower average daily rates in the second quarter. Rivian Automotive jumped 1.8 per cent after the electrical vehicle maker beat estimates for its first-quarter results and reiterated its annual production forecast. - with Reuters",

The Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 0.4 per cent last month after gaining 0.1 per cent in March. The increase was in line with economists' expectations, according to Reuters. Stubbornly high rents accounted for much of the increase in inflation. However, there were pockets of relief for consumers. Food prices were unchanged for a second straight month. Grocery store prices fell 0.2 per cent after decreasing 0.3 per cent in March, posting back-to-back declines for the first time since July 2019. Fruits and vegetables, meat, fish and eggs were cheaper compared to March. Milk prices dropped 2 per cent. Natural gas prices tumbled 4.9 per cent and the cost of electricity dropped for the second straight month, blunting some of the 3 per cent jump in gasoline prices, which followed a 4.6 per cent plunge in March. The rebound came after Saudi Arabia and other OPEC+ oil producers announced further oil output cuts. Annual inflation increased 4.9 per cent, which was the smallest yearly rise since April 2021. - with Reuters",

Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA) were $383 million, down from $427 million in the previous corresponding period. Net profit after tax (NPAT) was $200 million, down from $246 million in the first half of 2022. Grancorp lifted its full year guidance: EBITDA of $500- $560 million, up from $470- $530 million. NPAT of $220- $260 million, up from $180- 220 million. GrainCorp's Managing Director and Chief Executive Robert Spurway said there was ongoing demand for Australian grain and oilseeds, supported by a bumper third crop on the east coast. \"GrainCorp's export program ran at close to full capacity with 4.4mmt of grain and oilseeds exported during the half,\" Mr Spurway said. \"Export supply chain margins remained solid, albeit not at the levels we saw last year.\" The company also acknowledged the death of a worker in a fatal truck accident in April at the Graincorp receival site in Moree, New South Wales.",

The S & P 500 gained 18.47 points, or 0.4 per cent, at 4,137, while the Nasdaq Composite added 126.89 points, or 1 per cent, at 12,306. The Nasdaq was helped by a 4.1 per cent climb in Google's parent company Alphabet as the company rolled out more artificial intelligence for its core search product in response to competition from Microsoft Corp. Large-cap tech stocks including Apple Inc and Microsoft also gained 1.04 per cent and 1.73 per cent, respectively. The rate-sensitive S & P 500 technology sector index went up 1.2 per cent and the communication services rose 1.69 per cent. Markets reacted positively because they saw the inflation data as a small positive, with hopes rising of a rate pause. \"The CPI is indicating some sort of relief in inflationary pressure. That would mean the Fed would be toward the end or already at the end of its interest rate cycle, and growth companies are most heavily affected by higher interest rates,\" Kevin W. Philip, a partner at investment advisor Bel Air said. Fed funds futures traders are pricing in a pause in rate increases at the central bank's June meeting, and less than a 5 per cent chance of another 25 basis point hike. However, investors also had concerns about the looming US debt ceiling. Talks on raising the US federal government's $US31.4 trillion debt ceiling entered a new phase on Wednesday as some areas of potential compromise emerged after Tuesday's White House meeting. Regional bank shares extended declines from volatile sessions last week on concerns about the sector's health. PacWest Bancorp fell 0.5 per cent, and Zions Bancorporation fell 2.7 per cent respectively. Oil and gas producer Occidental Petroleum Corp fell 3.6 per cent after its first-quarter earnings fell short of analysts' estimates. Livent Corp rose 5.2 per cent after Australian lithium miner Allkem Ltd agreed to merge with the US-based chemical manufacturing firm to create a $US10.6 billion firm. Airbnb Inc 10.9 per cent as the vacation rental booking company had fewer bookings and lower average daily rates in the second quarter. Rivian Automotive jumped 1.8 per cent after the electrical vehicle maker beat estimates for its first-quarter results and reiterated its annual production forecast. - with Reuters",
