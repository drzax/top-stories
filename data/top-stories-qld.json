His family had travelled to Israel to celebrate an aunt's wedding. They were able to return home where he waited to welcome them home with a warm embrace. \"The cycle of violence continues unfortunately,\" he said. \"What happened there really shook my core — it was horrible, heartbreaking, to see the extent of violence and hatred.\" The Brisbane father said he was \"really relived\" to have his family home, having watched the horror unfold from afar.",
