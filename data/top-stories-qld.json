The review will look at competition laws, policies and institutions and a competition task force has been established in Treasury. The review will look at: Proposals put forward by the Australian      Competition and Consumer Commission around merger reform, as well as other      competition law issues Options for coordinated reform with states      and territories, to be progressed through the Council on Federal Financial      Relations Non-compete and related clauses that      restrict workers from shifting to a better-paying job Providing advice on competition issues      raised by new technologies, the net zero transformation and growth in the      care economy Former ACCC chair Rod Sims and current ACCC chair Gina Cass-Gottleib have called for stronger laws to stop mergers that entrench market power. \"We always need to get the balance right on merger reform,\" said Mr Leigh. \"The ACCC's proposals ... are serious proposals deserving of careful scrutiny\"",
