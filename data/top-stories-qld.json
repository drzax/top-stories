Speaking to News Breakfast from Ashdod, the ABC's global affairs editor John Lyons predicted Israel forces would go into the strip within the next 24 hours. \"The feeling here is that the US has given the green light that President Biden has basically signed off on it,\" he said. \"He had that condition that he wanted a humanitarian corridor into Egypt along the Rafah crossing. That is going to happen. \"The feeling here in Israel is they're ready to go. \" Humanitarian agencies feared any aid allowed in would not be near enough following days of Israeli bombardment. \"One thing that really brought it home to me was Gaza's rescue services put out a statement yesterday saying that we have so much on our plate that there are hundreds of people still buried alive under some of the rubble and we're not going to be able to get to all of them, \" he said. \"What a dreadful situation for those people caught under the rubble. They are still alive, but being told that sorry, we don't have enough people to get you out. The hospitals are chaotic. \"It's a tragic situation already and on top of that … they're about to face the full wrath of the most powerful army. \"",

Climate activists delayed the start of the speech, with about half a dozen protesters taking to the stage, unfurling a large banner and chanting. Security apparently dimmed the lights and removed Mr Powell from the room. But, let's get back to what he actually said. He acknowledged steady progress on slowing inflation and the role of rising yields. Treasury yields have soared recently on expectation rates will be kept higher for longer, which could slow the economy. \"We are attentive to recent data showing the resilience of economic growth and demand for labour. Additional evidence of persistently above-trend growth, or that tightness in the labour market is no longer easing, could put further progress on inflation at risk and could warrant further tightening of monetary polic y.\" Mr Powell also warned the Israel-Gaza war could impact the global economy. \"A range of uncertainties, both old and new, complicate our task of balancing the risk of tightening monetary policy too much against the risk of tightening too little,\" he said. He also referred to the US government's huge debt (US debt has increased to $US33 trillion!). \"We think that the US has an unsustainable path. Everyone knows that,\" Mr Powell said during the question and answer session. To sum up: the US economy's strength and continued tight labour markets could mean more rate rises are on the cards, however, the bond market is now doing some of the central bank's work for it (and might lessen the need for additional rate increases).",
