              "plaintext": "Israel says its aircraft struck two Hezbollah cells in Lebanon early on Monday local time that were planning to launch anti-tank missiles and rockets toward Israel as fighting flares across the two countries' shared border. Lebanon's state-run news agency NNA reported Hezbollah saying one of its fighters was killed, without providing details. NNA has also reported an Israeli air strike on the southern outskirts of Aitaroun, in southern Lebanon. It also did not provide details. The Israeli military said one cell was adjacent to the Israeli town of Mattat, around 13 km south-west of Aitaroun. It said the other was further north in the disputed Shebaa Farms area. It was not immediately clear if the two sides were referring to the same set of incidents. On social media platform Telegram, the IDF says it \"thwarted\" planned attacks from Hezbollah cells. \"A short while ago, the IDF identified two Hezbollah terrorist cells in Lebanese territory. One cell was adjacent to the area of Mattat, and planned to launch anti-tank missiles toward Israeli territory,\" the post read. \"The other, located in Har Dov, planned to launch rockets. The IDF thwarted the attacks, striking the Hezbollah terrorist cells before they fired.\" Israel says it later struck more Hezbollah targets, including a compound and an observation post. There are no immediate reports of injuries or damage. Iran-backed Hezbollah and Israel have been trading fire at the frontier with increasing frequency since Palestinian group Hamas carried out a shock attack on Israel on October 7 and Israel responded with intense air strikes on Gaza. Israel has moved to evacuate 42 communities along its northern front with Lebanon over the fighting, which Hezbollah says has killed at least 27 of its fighters since October 7. Lebanese security sources say 11 fighters with Palestinian groups in Lebanon, allied to Hezbollah, have been killed in the border area, alongside four civilians. At least five Israeli soldiers and one civilian have been killed on Israel's side of the frontier, according to Israeli military reports.",

But one stock defying the recent gloom is Weebit Nano, which develops \"advanced semiconductor memory technology\". It's the ASX 200's top gainer by far today up 16.2% to $4.37, and has gained around 50% over the past four trading sessions. It all began with a 6.9% jump to $3.11 on Wednesday, a day before it put out a market update pre-open on Thursday morning announcing a major deal for South Korean foundry DB HiTek to licence its technology on chips. It then rose a further 6.8% on Thursday and 13.3% on Friday. Based in Israel and France, the company had previously updated the market on October 10 to assure investors that its operations would be unaffected by the Israel-Gaza war, with its lab currently unaffected and work-from-home contingency plans in place for its Israeli staff if needed. The other biggest gains as of the middle of the trading day are: ARB Corporation +4% to $31.46 Insignia Financial +2.7% to $2.095 Resmed +2.4% to $23.18 Fisher and Paykel Healthcare +1.9% to $19.29 The biggest losers (amongst many) are: New Hope Corporation -9% to $5.89 Pilbara Minerals -5.2% to $3.66 Mineral Resources -4.1% to $57.13 Alumina Ltd -4% to $0.7775 Coronado Global Resources -3.9% to $1.62 Overall, only a quarter of the ASX 200 companies were gaining ground, with 144 in the red and six flat. Healthcare (+1%) and consumer non-cyclicals (+0.4%) were the only sectors in the black. Energy (-2.4%) was down sharply, led by coal miners, while mining (-1.9%) and education (-1%) were also off steeply.",

So what are economists expecting to see at 11:30am AEDT this Wednesday when the ABS publishes CPI data for both the month and quarter of September? Westpac, which publishes a very detailed category-by-category breakdown of its forecast, is tipping both headline and 'trimmed mean' figures to come in at 1.1% for the quarter and 5.3 and 5% for the year, respectively. ( Trimmed mean is a key \"underlying\" measure of inflation preferred by the Reserve Bank because it excludes the most volatile price moves up and down). Westpac senior economist Justin Smirk says there are big uncertainties about just how much temporary electricity bill rebates and permanently increased childcare subsidies will offset price rises in those sectors, making forecasting harder than usual. \" Auto fuel is making the most significant contribution in the September quarter (+0.26ppt), closely followed by utilities (0.24ppt), food (0.17ppt), rents (0.13ppt), financial services (0.10ppt) and then dwelling purchases (0.09ppt).\" CBA's forecast for inflation is a little lower, at 0.9 and 1% for the headline and trimmed mean, respectively. It believes such a result would see the RBA sit tight in November. \"Our forecast for Q3 23 CPI is broadly similar to the RBA's implied profile from August. We believe this is consistent with monetary policy on hold in November.\" However, the bank's economists warn that the risks are to the upside for inflation, and a result much higher than forecast could see the RBA hike the cash rate by 0.25%pt next month. UBS's George Tharenou is forecasting an even higher 1.2%/1.1% headline/underlying result, which would add to pressure for a rate rise. ANZ's economists see the result as being 1.1/1.2% for headline and trimmed mean, which they say could see another rate hike. \"This outcome, particularly for trimmed mean, would cause the RBA some discomfort given its 'low tolerance for a slower return of inflation to target' than current forecasts. \"As we noted after the most recent minutes, risks of RBA action in the near-term appear to be rising. For now, we expect the cash rate to remain at 4.1%, although we'll ultimately make a call on the November Board meeting in the wake of the CPI.\" For what it's worth, the typical forecast according to a survey of economists by Reuters is for both headline and trimmed mean inflation to rise 1.1% in the quarter, or 5.3% and 5% up respectively over the past year. Financial markets are currently pricing in about a 30% chance of the RBA lifting the cash rate in a fortnight's time.",

The benchmark indices are down around 0.8% in early trade, with the ASX 200 at 6,845 points. Mining and energy are dominating the early falls, with real estate and consumer cyclical stocks also down on fears of an economic slowdown due to higher interest rates persisting for longer. In a clearly 'risk-off' day, the sectors posting solid gains are the more 'defensive' ones of consumer non-cyclicals and healthcare — the kinds of businesses we can't avoid when we're cutting spending. Treasury Wine Estates is one of the ASX 200's top gainers, up 3% to $12.12, after the Australian Government said China is undertaking a five month review into punitive wine tariffs, with a widespread expectation they will be removed early next year. The other top rises around 10:20am AEDT were: Weebit Nano +4% to $3.91 Bellevue Gold +3.7% to $1.555 BlueScope Steel +1.8% to $18.23 ARB Corp +1.8% to $30.81 The biggest falls were for: New Hope Corporation -7.7% to $5.97 Liontown Resources -3.7% to $1.83 Champion Iron -3.5% to $6.06 Pilbara Minerals -3.5% to $3.725 South32 -3% to $3.27",
