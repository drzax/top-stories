But this is not the first time Israel has said that. They previously said Hamas used underground areas in Al-Shifa during a 2008-2009 war, according to Reuters. That war saw more than 1,400 Palestinians and 13 Israelis killed. It was not possible to verify the claims at the time, Reuters says. The New York Times says one of their journalists in 2008 watched armed Hamas militants walking around Al-Shifa Hospital in civilian clothes. Amnesty Internationa l concluded in the 2014 conflict that Hamas used parts of Al-Shifa \"to detain, interrogate, torture and otherwise ill-treat suspects, even as other parts of the hospital continued to function as a medical center\".",
