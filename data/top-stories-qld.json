Applications per job increased by 6.5 per cent in August. That continues the trend we've been seeing for awhile after job ads peaked at record highs last year. More migration and a slowing economy means employers have more workers to choose from. Here's Seek managing director Kendra Banks: “After a slight rise in July, job ads declined 1.8 per cent in August driven by a drop in volumes in New South Wales. “Victoria and the Northern Territory were the only states to buck the trend, with regional job ad volumes in Victoria driving overall job ads up for the state, particularly those in retail & consumer products. \"Ads for retail & consumer products roles rose nationally for the second month, as businesses begin preparing for the Christmas season.\" “Applications per job ad continue to rise, and after six months of growth, levels are now higher than they were in July 2019, demonstrating that competition for jobs is greater than it was pre-COVID.\" However, demand for labour is still strong with the unemployment near fifty year lows of 3.7 per cent in July. Hospitality and tourism job ads were down by 3.1 per cent in August and they are down by nearly 41 per cent over the year, which suggests new migrants and international students are filling more of these jobs.",
