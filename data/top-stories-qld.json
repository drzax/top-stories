PwC has just released a statement saying the impact on it is relatively minor and few of its clients are affected. \"We are aware that MOVEit, a third party transfer platform, has experienced a cybersecurity incident which has impacted hundreds of organisations including PwC. PwC uses the software with a limited number of client engagements. \"As soon as we learned of this incident we stopped using the platform and started our own investigation. \"Our investigation has shown that PwC's own IT network has not been compromised and that MOVEit's vulnerability had a limited impact on PwC. We have reached out to the small number of clients whose files were impacted to discuss the incident. \"Data security is a key priority for PwC and we continue to put the right resources and safeguards in place to protect our network.\" It never rains but it pours. For more on the MOVEit hack, ABC News and Reuters had this story on Friday evening.",
