This story will continue to be updated with the latest, as our live coverage will be back on tomorrow morning. Here's a rundown of some of today's key events: About 50,000 Palestinians fled southward from northern Gaza on Wednesday, the United Nations said, the largest number of evacuees through an Israeli-controlled corridor that was first opened days ago The Senate has voted down the Greens motion calling for the government to support an Israel-Gaza ceasefire Gaza hospitals strain under Israeli siege, with premature births on the rise Negotiations mediated by Qatar are ongoing to secure the release of 10 to 15 hostages held by Hamas in exchange for a 1-2 day humanitarian pause in Gaza, a source briefed on the negotiations said The United Nations says the number of staff killed in Israel's operation in Gaza since October 7 has been the highest loss of life in the organisation's history Israel's military has claimed that Hamas has lost control of northern Gaza as thousands of residents have moved south The Rafah border crossing into Gaza was closed on Wednesday due to an unspecified \"security circumstance\" but US officials were working with Egypt and Israel to get it reopened West Bank raid injures 19 as Israel PM Benjamin Netanyahu denounces settler violence US Secretary of State Antony Blinken says Palestinians must be able to self-govern in Gaza, as well as the West Bank, under a unified Palestinian Authority after the war UN Secretary-General António Guterres says the number of civilians killed in the Gaza Strip shows that there is something \"clearly wrong\" with Israel's military operations against Hamas At least 19 people have been killed in an Israeli air strike on Jabalia refugee camp, the Palestinian interior ministry says The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Turk says war crimes have been committed by both Israel and Hamas",

The Israeli military allowed Palestinians to evacuate from 10am until 3pm. Clashes between the Hamas militant group that controls the besieged Palestinian enclave and the Israeli military have intensified in Gaza City. \"Clashes and shelling on and around the road reportedly continued, endangering evacuees with reports of corpses alongside the road,\" UNOCHA said in its daily report. \"Most evacuees are moving on foot and Israeli military reportedly forced those evacuees who use vehicles to leave them at the southern edge of Gaza City.\" The UN estimates that some 1.5 million Gazans out of the strip's population of 2.3 million have been internally displaced.

They have had no word about him since their ordeal, and that of the other hostage families, began on October 7. \"We feel we live in a separate universe than most of you,\" his father Ronen Neutra told AFP in an interview. \"We don't sleep well. We don't eat well,\" he said, his face and voice fatigued. \"We stopped working. We have a small business, we haven't been involved in it, everything stopped.\" \"This month feels like three months, and then again, it feels like yesterday,\" said Omer's mother, Orna, looking drained. Orna says she and the other hostage families know nothing about the status of their missing loved ones — whether they are being fed, if they are wounded — and does not understand Hamas's motive for the attack. Some family members of the American hostages spoke to Biden in a video call on October 13. Biden, who has pledged support for Israel in its war against Hamas, showed compassion as he spoke to the families for more than an hour and said he is determined to secure the hostages' release, Ronen said. \"As he said, it is a top priority,\" Orna added.",
