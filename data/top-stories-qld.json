Lila Cohan is a writer for the Netflix hit Bridgerton protesting in LA, and says production companies are making huge profits off ideas they created. \"Many writers, myself included, feel that has turned into a gig economy, like white collar version of driving for Uber.

The proposed freeze would seek to close a loophole allowing landlords to start a bidding war between prospective tenants. The Greens also say rent caps should apply to the property, not just to individual leases to ensure tenants do not face eviction so their landlords can hike the rent. Australian Associated Press reports the party will introduce their proposal to parliament during budget week. Housing ministers are set to meet today to discuss ways to tackle Australia's housing crisis, including strengthening renters' rights. Opposition finance spokeswoman Jane Hume says ministers needed to come up with solutions without adding to inflation. \"When there's a scarcity of housing and there's a rental crisis, there's some urgency for the government to come up with a policy that is going to house these huge number of migrants were expecting to come into the country,\" she told AAP. \"Infrastructure is being cut. Having an increased migration intake but a decreased amount of infrastructure to support that migration on top of the housing crisis, that's a recipe for disaster.\""

The surgeon-general, Vivek Murthy, has released an advisory calling for social isolation to be treated as seriously as obesity or drug abuse. It warns that almost half of all Americans have experienced loneliness, increasing their risk of premature mortality by almost 30 per cent. \"We now know that loneliness is a common feeling that many people experience. It's like hunger or thirst. It's a feeling the body sends us when something we need for survival is missing,\" Murthy told The Associated Press. \"Millions of people in America are struggling in the shadows, and that's not right. That's why I issued this advisory to pull back the curtain on a struggle that too many people are experiencing.\""

Speaking on ABC News Breakfast this morning, Chalmers acknowledged the market was surprised by the RBA's decision, after most major banks predicted rates would remain on hold. \"The impact of these rate rises that are already in the system will be felt over a period of time and each time the independent Reserve Bank gathers, they weigh up all of the considerations, all the pressures in the economy, including this global uncertainty that we are going through right now and they will take that decision independently,\" he said. Chalmers said Australians' budgets were \"already under the pump\", and that next week's federal budget would include some cost of living relief. \"The budget will have a substantial package of relief when it comes to medicines, it will have a package on child care, there will be a bit of help for people with their energy bills,\" he said."

The balloon was first detected on Friday, and was the latest balloon sighting after the US military shot down what officials said was a Chinese spy balloon about three months ago. A defence official has told The Associated Press there was no indication the latest balloon was connected to China or any other adversary, and it presented no threats to aviation or national security. The official said the balloon was floating at about 11,000 metres, and did not fly over any critical defence infrastructure or sensitive sites. After determining that the balloon presented no threat to people on the ground or to aviation over Hawaii, the military took no action to bring it down, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss military operations."

                  "headline": "Nick Cave explains why he's going to King Charles III's coronation",
                  "articleBody": "\"Why the f*** are you going to the King's coronation?\" \"Are you a Monarchist? Why go?\" \"The coronation. Seriously????\" These are just some of the messages Australian music icon Nick Cave has received since being announced as a guest for King Charles III's coronation this Saturday. So, the transgressive singer-songwriter has responded in a blog post as part of his The Red Hand Files series. Here's what he wrote ( with my favourite bits highlighted in bold ): Dear Jon, Adrian, Roger and Matt, I'll make this a quick one because I've got to work out what I am going to wear to the Coronation. I am not a monarchist, nor am I a royalist, nor am I an ardent republican for that matter; what I am also not is so spectacularly incurious about the world and the way it works, so ideologically captured, so damn grouchy, as to refuse an invitation to what will more than likely be the most important historical event in the UK of our age. Not just the most important, but the strangest, the weirdest. I once met the late Queen at an event at Buckingham Palace for 'Aspirational Australians living in the UK' (or something like that). It was a mostly awkward affair, but the Queen herself, dressed in a salmon coloured twin-set, seemed almost extraterrestrial and was the most charismatic woman I have ever met. Maybe it was the lighting, but she actually glowed. As I told my mother – who was the same age as the Queen and, like the Queen, died in her nineties – about that day, her old eyes filled with tears. When I watched the Queen's funeral on the television last year I found, to my bafflement, that I was weeping myself as the coffin was stripped of the crown, orb and sceptre and lowered through the floor of St. George's Chapel. I guess what I am trying to say is that, beyond the interminable but necessary debates about the abolition of the monarchy, I hold an inexplicable emotional attachment to the Royals – the strangeness of them, the deeply eccentric nature of the whole affair that so perfectly reflects the unique weirdness of Britain itself. I'm just drawn to that kind of thing – the bizarre, the uncanny, the stupefyingly spectacular, the awe-inspiring. And as for what the young Nick Cave would have thought – well, the young Nick Cave was, in all due respect to the young Nick Cave, young, and like many young people, mostly demented, so I'm a little cautious around using him as a benchmark for what I should or should not do. He was cute though, I'll give him that. Deranged, but cute. So, with all that in mind, I am looking forward to going the Coronation. I think I'll wear a suit. Love, Nick"

The 76ers centre lost the MVP award to Jokić in the past two seasons. If Jokić wins again, however, he would be the first player to win three consecutive MVP awards since Boston's Larry Bird (from 1984 to 1986). The award is decided by a panel of sportswriters and broadcasters, as well as fans. We'll bring you the announcement of the winner when it happens this morning."

After voting, Bahr quickly turns his camera off, leaving a black screen showing just his name. You can then see some people in the office trying not to laugh at his brief appearance. A GOP Senate spokeswoman said Bahr, a truck driver, worked until 4:45am on the day of the meeting, so we'll give him the benefit of the doubt. (Watch from 6:35)"

The Greens also say rent caps should apply to the property, not just to individual leases to ensure tenants do not face eviction so their landlords can hike the rent. Australian Associated Press reports the party will introduce their proposal to parliament during budget week. Housing ministers are set to meet today to discuss ways to tackle Australia's housing crisis, including strengthening renters' rights. Opposition finance spokeswoman Jane Hume says ministers needed to come up with solutions without adding to inflation. \"When there's a scarcity of housing and there's a rental crisis, there's some urgency for the government to come up with a policy that is going to house these huge number of migrants were expecting to come into the country,\" she told AAP. \"Infrastructure is being cut.

Speaking on ABC News Breakfast this morning, Chalmers acknowledged the market was surprised by the RBA's decision, after most major banks predicted rates would remain on hold. \"The impact of these rate rises that are already in the system will be felt over a period of time and each time the independent Reserve Bank gathers, they weigh up all of the considerations, all the pressures in the economy, including this global uncertainty that we are going through right now and they will take that decision independently,\" he said. Chalmers said Australians' budgets were \"already under the pump\", and that next week's federal budget would include some cost of living relief. \"The budget will have a substantial package of relief when it comes to medicines, it will have a package on child care, there will be a bit of help for people with their energy bills,\" he said.",

Seriously????\" These are just some of the messages Australian music icon Nick Cave has received since being announced as a guest for King Charles III's coronation this Saturday. So, the transgressive singer-songwriter has responded in a blog post as part of his The Red Hand Files series. Here's what he wrote ( with my favourite bits highlighted in bold ): Dear Jon, Adrian, Roger and Matt, I'll make this a quick one because I've got to work out what I am going to wear to the Coronation. I am not a monarchist, nor am I a royalist, nor am I an ardent republican for that matter; what I am also not is so spectacularly incurious about the world and the way it works, so ideologically captured, so damn grouchy, as to refuse an invitation to what will more than likely be the most important historical event in the UK of our age. Not just the most important, but the strangest, the weirdest. I once met the late Queen at an event at Buckingham Palace for 'Aspirational Australians living in the UK' (or something like that). It was a mostly awkward affair, but the Queen herself, dressed in a salmon coloured twin-set, seemed almost extraterrestrial and was the most charismatic woman I have ever met. Maybe it was the lighting, but she actually glowed. As I told my mother – who was the same age as the Queen and, like the Queen, died in her nineties – about that day, her old eyes filled with tears. When I watched the Queen's funeral on the television last year I found, to my bafflement, that I was weeping myself as the coffin was stripped of the crown, orb and sceptre and lowered through the floor of St. George's Chapel. I guess what I am trying to say is that, beyond the interminable but necessary debates about the abolition of the monarchy, I hold an inexplicable emotional attachment to the Royals – the strangeness of them, the deeply eccentric nature of the whole affair that so perfectly reflects the unique weirdness of Britain itself. I'm just drawn to that kind of thing – the bizarre, the uncanny, the stupefyingly spectacular, the awe-inspiring. And as for what the young Nick Cave would have thought – well, the young Nick Cave was, in all due respect to the young Nick Cave, young, and like many young people, mostly demented, so I'm a little cautious around using him as a benchmark for what I should or should not do. He was cute though, I'll give him that. Deranged, but cute. So, with all that in mind, I am looking forward to going the Coronation. I think I'll wear a suit. Love, Nick",

The previously announced finalists are: Giannis Antetokounmpo (Milwaukee Bucks) Joel Embiid (Philadelphia 76ers) Nikola Jokić (Denver Nuggets) Embiid appears to be the favourite this year, after leading the NBA in scoring for a second-straight season. The 76ers centre lost the MVP award to Jokić in the past two seasons. If Jokić wins again, however, he would be the first player to win three consecutive MVP awards since Boston's Larry Bird (from 1984 to 1986). The award is decided by a panel of sportswriters and broadcasters, as well as fans. We'll bring you the announcement of the winner when it happens this morning.",

A senator in the US state of Minnesota has become a reluctant social media star after voting shirtless while lying in bed during a meeting. In a video streamed on YouTube ( which you can watch below from the 6:35 mark ), Republican Senator Calvin Bahr can briefly be seen voting during a Zoom call. After voting, Bahr quickly turns his camera off, leaving a black screen showing just his name. You can then see some people in the office trying not to laugh at his brief appearance. A GOP Senate spokeswoman said Bahr, a truck driver, worked until 4:45am on the day of the meeting, so we'll give him the benefit of the doubt. (Watch from 6:35)",

Speaking on ABC News Breakfast this morning, Chalmers acknowledged the market was surprised by the RBA's decision, after most major banks predicted rates would remain on hold. \"The impact of these rate rises that are already in the system will be felt over a period of time and each time the independent Reserve Bank gathers, they weigh up all of the considerations, all the pressures in the economy, including this global uncertainty that we are going through right now and they will take that decision independently,\" he said. Chalmers said Australians' budgets were \"already under the pump\", and that next week's federal budget would include some cost of living relief. \"The budget will have a substantial package of relief when it comes to medicines, it will have a package on child care, there will be a bit of help for people with their energy bills,\" he said.",
