Absolutely dominant in every category - possession, shots, corners, passes, you name it - but not able to capitalise on any of it where it matters (the score-line). To their credit, Chinese Taipei have defended brilliantly. Just like Iran, they've packed themselves into two tight banks, forcing the Matildas to play around and through them. And while Australia have found channels and pockets of space, they haven't had the shooting accuracy to make the most of those moments before a cloud of white shirts descend around them. Mary Fowler has been the Australian to come closest, with a number of shots slamming into some brave defenders, while several shots from her team-mates have flown everywhere else except on target. Chinese Taipei's goalkeeper, Cheng Ssu-Yu, has also been massive, always in the right place at the right time and throwing her body about. Her team would be in the pits right now if she wasn't having such a cracking performance. What do you think should happen from here, fam? Should Tony Gustavsson stick with this same starting line-up and the same game-plan, or change it up at the break?",
