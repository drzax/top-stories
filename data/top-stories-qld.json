The only other fall in employment in 2023 was in April, which also included school holidays. \"While unemployment increased by 36,000 people in July, to 541,000, it was still around 172,000 lower than before the pandemic .\" Mr Jarvis said the high participation rate of 66.8% coupled with an underemployment rate of 6.4% suggests the labour market is still experiencing tight conditions.",
