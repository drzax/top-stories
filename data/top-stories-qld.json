CBA's Kristina Clifton writes: \"At the previous meeting in June the BoE stepped up the pace of tightening again and hiked by 50bp after 25bp hikes at the March and May meetings. The larger 50bp hike in June was triggered by stronger than expected labour earnings and CPI data released in the lead up to the meeting. The latest CPI data showed a slight deceleration in core and services inflation in June. However growth in labour earnings has lifted further. With inflation and earnings not yet having convincingly turned around we favour a 50bp increase at today's meeting. A 50bp hike would take the bank rate to 5.50%, in line with the US FOMC and RBNZ. Thereafter we expect one last 25bp hike in September taking the bank rate to 5.75%.\"",
