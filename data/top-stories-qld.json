They're literally in an Israeli cage and Israel is harming them yet again.\" She felt like the world, including Australia, was treating Palestinian life as totally worthless and people in Gaza were living in fear not knowing when bombardments would happen. \"This is the first time Israel is going into a bombardment campaign having already taken the green light from governments like the Australian Government and the United States and other world governments,\" she said. \"They got the green light to go in and commit the war crimes. That can I do whatever they want and I think this is the lowest point in the Australian history where it comes to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict.\" She also said she was now worried about losing contact with those inside Gaza. \"Everything is cut off,\" she said. \"I know the hospitals are struggling, saying they are unable to deal with especially the casualties. The death rate is shooting through the roof. A lot of families have been wiped out in the last 48 hours.\" Watch the video below as Australians share stories of what their families are experiencing in Israel and Gaza.",

[…] And we're in a war which we need to first and foremost win,\" he told 7.30's Sarah Ferguson. He said Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has \"no other choice\" but to proceed with a full scale assault, even if it means that hostages are killed. Avivi said he believed there was a lack of intelligence from Israeli forces before the Hamas attack. “The Gaza division was especially talking about the fact that it was a holiday and Saturday was really conducting itself normally, many people were on vacation,” he said. “The extent of that attack was so big and simultaneous that the soldiers themselves found themselves fighting their first fight and not really being able at the same time to assist in towns and towns found themselves without army assistance for a long time, and this was devastating.” Reporting by ABC 7.30",

The behaviour of the vast, vast majority of voters and campaigners from all sides has been perfect. No issues,\" AEC Commissioner Tom Rodgers told RN Breakfast host Patricia Karvelas this morning. \" It is always a small number of people. I think, particularly a referendum, unleashes passions that can boil over. \"We've seen, what I would call, unacceptable conduct including filming of our staff who are just trying to do the right thing. \"We, as we have always done, are urging civility by everybody. \"The good thing is, that's mostly what we're seeing. I'm encouraging even more of it.\" You can listen to the full interview from RN Breakfast using the link below.",

Campaigners outside told us that some voters were unsure about their choice while others walked in with a clear decision in mind. Voters and campaigners alike said finding accurate information wasn't easy and misinformation and disinformation was visible on social media platforms. So, we asked a few young voters about their choice and how they arrived at their decision: Max, electrician apprentice \"I voted 'no'. I've heard so many things and apparently, it's going to divide the country,\" he said. Max says among his friends who are Indigenous, their views on the referendum are split. \"A lot of them have said 'no' but I've also got others that said 'yes',\" he said. Not knowing a lot about it, I'm just going to stay out of it and vote 'no'.\" Laila, UTS student \"I'm going to vote 'yes'. I feel like we got a lot of information, some of it false, some of it true,\" she said. Laila says before the referendum, she assumed First Nations people already had a voice on matters that impacted them. \"It's just about giving everyone a chance to have their say in a country that is more rightfully theirs, than ours anyway,\" she said.",

His has been a name that has floated around heavily as the assumption has been West Coast will be desperate to land him, and could facilitate a pick-one trade as a result. While this is largely based on the fact he is from WA, it's also true that he is one of the brightest prospects in the draft. Curtin is a versatile player, tall enough to play as a key-position player and slick enough to move into the midfield, as he did often this year. His left foot is deadly, and he has the rare ability to slow play down around him when he is in possession. My question around Curtin is what position he ends up playing. I'm not sold that he will be a centre-half-back in the AFL, as I don't think he is quite strong enough in the air. His ability at ground-level and skills mean a midfield move is possible, but there just isn't enough exposed form there to be certain he will make it in that spot in the big leagues. But the worst case scenario in Curtin's case is he becomes a dangerous rebounding defender, who can pick teams apart with by foot and play on both tall and small forwards. There is scope for him to become a Jordan Dawson-esque midfielder though, with the leadership attributes to match. He is incredibly professional, and has all the attributes of a 200+ game AFL footballer. He'll more than likely go in the top five, and could well line up in round one for whoever picks him up. Sounds pretty damn good, hey?",
