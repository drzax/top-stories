What does seem sure is that there will now be a flurry of legal filings as the lawyers for the 19 defendants in this case submit motions on why their client’s case should or shouldn’t be severed from the others.

The Federal Court proceedings have been launched against IAG's subsidiaries of Insurance Australia Limited (IAL) and Insurance Manufacturers of Australia (IMA). ASIC claims the insurers were misleading in encouraging loyalty discounts to entice customers to renew their home insurance policies, \"as loyal customers may have had their premiums increased before the discounts were applied\". IAL and IMA renewed more than 1 million home insurance policies, involving the SGIO, SGIC and RACV brands. \"We allege that IAG subsidiaries, IAL and IMA, misled their customers about the extent of the discounts they would receive,\" ASIC deputy chair Sarah Court said. \"The way they operated their pricing algorithm meant that some longer term or more loyal customers were allocated, or may have been allocated, higher premiums before the promised discounts were applied. \"There is a risk that loyal customers, having been promised a discount, were persuaded to stay with these companies, and in doing so lost their opportunity to shop around for a better price. \" ASIC also alleges between August 25, 2017 and August 24, 2023 : IAL made statements about its SGIO and SGIC branded home insurance policies on websites and in other documents that SGIO and SGIC customers would receive a 'Loyalty Discount' IMA made statements about RACV branded home insurance policies on websites and other documents that RACV customers would receive a 'Years of Membership Discount' and/or a 'Multi-Policy Discount', and IAG’s pricing algorithm operated inconsistently with their discount promises and therefore IAG failed to operate efficiently, honestly and fairly.

Bunnings, which is its biggest money-maker, saw earnings rise by 1.2% to $2.23 billion compared to a year ago, as the DIY retailer saw strong demand and activity from customers in the between January 1 and June 30 this year. Kmart's revenue rose to $10.63 billion for the last financial year, an increase of 16.5% compared to the year prior. It also earned $769 million — 52.3% above the previous financial year —and is a new record for the business, which Wesfarmers attributes to more normal trading conditions after COVID restrictions eased. Wesfarmers also owns Officeworks, and which also saw significant growth. Its revenue climbed by 5.9% to $3.35 billion, reflected by back to school trading ( thanks to no more home learning from the pandemic) and more orders from businesses. The country's largest-listed conglomerate said net profit after tax came in at $2.47 billion, compared to $2.35 billion a year earlier. Wesfarmers will pay a $1.03 dividend per share.",

Let's start as we usually do by looking at what happened overseas last night, where Wall Street finished lower: The Dow Jones was down 1.1%, the S & P 500 fell by 1.4%, and the Nasdaq down 1.9%. Why? It's mostly because of what's happening in Jackson Hole, Wyoming right now. As I write this, there's a whole group of central bankers gathering for an annual symposium, which is just a fancy way of saying they're having a big conference to discuss the economic and financial outlook for the US. High on the agenda? Inflation — and a speech by Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell (who is pictured above alongside New York Fed president John Williams ). In his speech, Powell is going to outline how the US economy is faring and give an indicator into how the US central bank might approach its next rates meeting. The anticipation for that speech is so high that it's already given markets the jitters and led to investor uncertainty. To quote CommSec senior analyst Tom Piotrowski : \"The markets are a little bit twitchy to say the least ahead of that [speech].\" That's not happening until about midnight AEST, but it looks like it'll be enough to keep our local market on edge, with the ASX set to open lower. Plus, earnings season is continuing to roll on for another day — we've already heard from Wesfarmers, which has seen a near 5% jump in profits to $2.465 billion. (More on their results shortly.) Right, let's get a coffee (or a tonic of your choosing) and finish the week strong, shall we?",
