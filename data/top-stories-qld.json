              "plaintext": "It's been a tight and tense tussle in the first half - with Nigeria having by far the better of the chances as they frequently went around England's back three to get balls into the box. A couple of great saves from Mary Earps and some telling blocks have kept England in it. Nigeria have not allowed England to settle one bit when they've had possession - charging them down and using their immense physicality to win the ball back. However, England will have questions of Honduran referee Melissa Borjas after she overruled her original decision to award a penalty. If nothing else, it's hard not to feel sorry for Ireland if that is not a penalty - because Hayley Raso's decisive incident in the opening game was far softer than that.",
