                  "articleBody": "In healthcare, one of the big things to watch for tonight will be Medicare. The specialist reporting team's Penny Timms is here to help sort through it all: Penny: You might remember that last year, the federal government asked a team of experts to put their heads together and come up with recommendations on how to improve access to primary care and reduce the load on hospitals. Their Strengthening Medicare report, released in February, called for a rethink of how Australia funds primary care and GPs – but did not result in any immediate announcements. At the time, medical experts criticised the report for not including enough detail. So, a lot of people in healthcare will be looking out for the Strengthening Medicare Taskforce’s suggested reforms, and detail on how they will actually happen. The government has talked a big game, and if it doesn't do much, that is likely to be a talking point. During the election, Labor promised close to $1 billion for Medicare and GPs. Of that cash, $750 million was earmarked for the Strengthening Medicare scheme. Now the healthcare sector is waiting to see how it’s spent. One other area to watch is whether this budget will include funding for the promised Centre for Disease Control (CDC), which would better prepare Australia for national health emergencies. Last year’s October “mini-budget” included $3.2 million for “preparations to establish” the CDC. The government and health advocates have already flagged such a centre would require significant additional funding."

Speaking to ABC News Breakfast, Finance Minister Katy Gallagher said it's a \"significant package\". Kate Gallagher : Not just in the scale, but in the reach that we're trying to have with it. So, you know, you'll see different measures as part of that cost of living package. But I think what it shows is that, that really has been front and center our thinking as we finalise the budget... How to provide that sensible and affordable cost of living relief against, you know, an environment of high inflation and that's been certainly a challenge as we've been making our decisions, but people will see the full details of that."

The ABC's political reporter Tom Lowrey joins us, and says it's likely the relief will come in the form of subsidies on energy bills, as opposed to direct payments to households: Tom: For months the federal government has been talking up energy price relief as a “centrepiece” of the budget, and tonight they will finally put some detail to the rhetoric. $1.5bn was pledged in December to help Australians push their power bills down, which would be matched by the states and territories. It’s expected tonight’s package will see roughly five million households, and one million businesses, receive up to $500 in relief from their power bills. The support is expected to primarily be targeted at pensioners, others on government payments and small businesses. It’s also likely that rather than being paid directly to households, the relief will come as subsidies on energy bills. But the arrangements could become quite complex, as the federal government coordinates its package with various state and territory governments, and energy retailers."

While Bridget is taking you through what we're expecting and what it will all mean for you, I'm trawling through the budget papers with a fine-tooth comb alongside a bunch of my colleagues. You'll hear from me throughout the blog, and I'll be bursting out of the lock-up at 7.30 pm to join you live and tell you everything there is to know about this year's budget."

The specialist reporting team's Penny Timms is here to help sort through it all: Penny: You might remember that last year, the federal government asked a team of experts to put their heads together and come up with recommendations on how to improve access to primary care and reduce the load on hospitals. Their Strengthening Medicare report, released in February, called for a rethink of how Australia funds primary care and GPs – but did not result in any immediate announcements. At the time, medical experts criticised the report for not including enough detail. So, a lot of people in healthcare will be looking out for the Strengthening Medicare Taskforce’s suggested reforms, and detail on how they will actually happen. The government has talked a big game, and if it doesn't do much, that is likely to be a talking point. During the election, Labor promised close to $1 billion for Medicare and GPs. Of that cash, $750 million was earmarked for the Strengthening Medicare scheme. Now the healthcare sector is waiting to see how it’s spent. One other area to watch is whether this budget will include funding for the promised Centre for Disease Control (CDC), which would better prepare Australia for national health emergencies. Last year’s October “mini-budget” included $3.2 million for “preparations to establish” the CDC. The government and health advocates have already flagged such a centre would require significant additional funding.",

Speaking to ABC News Breakfast, Finance Minister Katy Gallagher said it's a \"significant package\". Kate Gallagher : Not just in the scale, but in the reach that we're trying to have with it. So, you know, you'll see different measures as part of that cost of living package. But I think what it shows is that, that really has been front and center our thinking as we finalise the budget... How to provide that sensible and affordable cost of living relief against, you know, an environment of high inflation and that's been certainly a challenge as we've been making our decisions, but people will see the full details of that.",

The ABC's political reporter Tom Lowrey joins us, and says it's likely the relief will come in the form of subsidies on energy bills, as opposed to direct payments to households: Tom: For months the federal government has been talking up energy price relief as a “centrepiece” of the budget, and tonight they will finally put some detail to the rhetoric. $1.5bn was pledged in December to help Australians push their power bills down, which would be matched by the states and territories. It’s expected tonight’s package will see roughly five million households, and one million businesses, receive up to $500 in relief from their power bills. The support is expected to primarily be targeted at pensioners, others on government payments and small businesses. It’s also likely that rather than being paid directly to households, the relief will come as subsidies on energy bills. But the arrangements could become quite complex, as the federal government coordinates its package with various state and territory governments, and energy retailers.",

The specialist reporting team's Penny Timms is here to help sort through it all: Penny: You might remember that last year, the federal government asked a team of experts to put their heads together and come up with recommendations on how to improve access to primary care and reduce the load on hospitals. Their Strengthening Medicare report, released in February, called for a rethink of how Australia funds primary care and GPs – but did not result in any immediate announcements. At the time, medical experts criticised the report for not including enough detail. So, a lot of people in healthcare will be looking out for the Strengthening Medicare Taskforce’s suggested reforms, and detail on how they will actually happen. The government has talked a big game, and if it doesn't do much, that is likely to be a talking point. During the election, Labor promised close to $1 billion for Medicare and GPs. Of that cash, $750 million was earmarked for the Strengthening Medicare scheme. Now the healthcare sector is waiting to see how it’s spent. One other area to watch is whether this budget will include funding for the promised Centre for Disease Control (CDC), which would better prepare Australia for national health emergencies. Last year’s October “mini-budget” included $3.2 million for “preparations to establish” the CDC. The government and health advocates have already flagged such a centre would require significant additional funding.",

It’s expected tonight’s package will see roughly five million households, and one million businesses, receive up to $500 in relief from their power bills. The support is expected to primarily be targeted at pensioners, others on government payments and small businesses. It’s also likely that rather than being paid directly to households, the relief will come as subsidies on energy bills.
