              "plaintext": "And to add a little more to the PwC scandal... Guardian Australia is reporting that a former KPMG partner is urging the federal government to consider a royal commission into the consulting industry. Professor Brendan Lyon, in a submission to a current senate inquiry into the consulting industry, says self-regulation has clearly for the industry. \"Unaddressed CEO-level ethics scandals in PwC and KPMG combined with a sustained decline in audit quality by the major accounting firms suggests that professional standards are falling, because self-regulation is failing,\" he says in his submission. \"Australia is unusual in our continuing reliance on self-regulation of the accounting profession. \"Accounting scandals have seen most other peer economies implement public oversight and enforcement of professional and ethical standards to better enforce the boundary between profits and principles.\" Professor Lyon has made three recommendations in his submission ( it is submission #45 ): Recommendation one: The inquiry should recommend the Commonwealth form an independent public regulator styled on the US PCAOB and other international examples, which should: a. Be governed by a board with a majority of independent directors who are prominent professionals in other fields (e.g., doctors, lawyers, company directors), but not accountants. b. Have a statutory investigation function with power to compel information from accounting bodies, firms and individual accountants. c. Have a statutory ethics tribunal function to determine facts and remedies for breaches of APESB and other standards. d. Have a statutory reporting function with obligations on professional bodies to report misconduct, malpractice and other breaches. e. Require statutory registration of large accounting practices and key management personnel thereof. f. Have a research and policy function to engage with the APESB and international standards and ethics bodies, including on enforcement trends. g. Ensure transparent public release of information. Recommendation two: The Commonwealth should consider the utility of a Royal Commission into the accounting profession and major accounting firms, considering: a. The role, function, obligations and expectations on the accounting profession and major firms. b. The cause and remedy to the decline in audit quality by the major accounting firms. c. The cause and remedy to ethics scandals relating to non-assurance consulting work by the major firms. d. Whether there are unreported risks from incomplete corporate and/or public sector financial reporting arising from lax enforcement of professional and ethical standards. e. The adequacy of self-regulation by CAANZ other professional accounting bodies. f. Identify statutory, regulatory and governance reforms to better maintain professional ethics and standards for accountants. My final recommendation concerns the Commonwealth’s interest as a purchaser of services in a consulting market dominated by Big Four accounting firms: Recommendation three : In respect of its own procurement and management of consultants, the Commonwealth should: a. Request the ANAO undertake a detailed performance audit on the selection and management of consultants, including integrity risks to officials and instances of poor professional practice or integrity breaches by consultants. b. Adopt a consultant rotation mechanism, requiring Big Four firms and other ‘top 10’ consultants to sit out one complete year in each four in working for any one department, to avoid entrenched dependence. c. Ban Big Four and other large providers from making political donations. d. Implement similar restrictions and obligations on public sector consultants to those binding public servants under the APS and other codes of conduct. e.
