Hodder Watt says a lack of signage, translators and low foot traffic at some of the booths meant many community members weren't aware that voting was underway. \"It really was left up to community members and organisations on the day to make people aware,\" he said. \"There is a risk there that some people would have missed out.\"",

She joined federal Liberal colleagues at the Marden polling booth and held an impromptu press conference, saying she believes exit polls are under-representing No votes. \"There are those that are reluctant to express a public vote for No. \"Really, if we were to take people's true measure of how they actually voted, we would probably find that there were more people voting No than actually those who have come out to say publicly.\" Senator Jacinta Nampijinpa Price plans to cast her ballot in her home town next week. The Marden polling booth is in the federal electorate of Sturt and the local Liberal MP James Stevens says how people vote there will be crucial. \"If Sturt votes No, South Australia will vote No and if South Australia votes No the referendum will be defeated, so we take our responsibility here on the ground very seriously.\"",

Rinehart's company Hancock Prospecting let the ASX know yesterday evening that it has recently increased its stake in Liontown to 14.67%, from 12.36%. It will give Hancock a greater say over Liontown's direction as it awaits a takeover offer from Ablemarle, the world's biggest lithium producer. And when you look back through the company filings, you'll find Ms Rinehart has been increasing her stake in Liontown quite quickly. Less than four weeks ago, the Hancock group owned 7.72% voting power, but that was increased to 10.69% two weeks later, then to 12.36%, and now to 14.67%.

The RBNZ decision leaves the cash rate at its 15-year high for a third straight meeting. \"Interest rates are constraining economic activity and reducing inflationary pressure as required,\" the central bank said in a statement. The RBNZ said the monetary committee agreed that interest rates will need to remain at a restrictive level for the foreseeable future to ensure consumer price inflation returns to its 1% to 3% target range. \"With monetary conditions remaining restrictive, spending growth is expected to decline further,\" the bank said. However, like the RBA, it cautioned of potential future increases to rates should inflation not slow as much as required.",
