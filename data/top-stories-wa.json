It's the second consecutive quarter of lower annual inflation. This is known as \" disinflation\". Market economists were expecting the headline rate of annual inflation to fall to 6.2 per cent, so it's lower than they were anticipating. And what about underlying inflation? The Reserve Bank is particularly interested in underlying inflation, because that shows us what's happening to inflation when volatile price movements are stripped out of the headline figure. The ABS refers to underlying inflation as \"trimmed mean\" inflation. And it has fallen to 5.9 per cent in the June quarter, down from 6.6 per cent in the March quarter, and the peak in December 2022 of 6.9 per cent. When the RBA talks about wanting to get inflation back down into its 2-3% target range, it's talking about underlying/trimmed mean inflation. So it's heading back towards target.",
