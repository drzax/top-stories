However, WA’s budget which promises “genuine cost-of-living relief” won’t provide any rent relief either, which the WA Council of Social Service chief executive Louise Giolitto says is desperately needed. “We welcome some of the cost relief benefits that are in today’s budget. However, this is the fourth year where the government has released an incredible surplus,” Ms Giolitto said. “So much more could have been done to support those vulnerable households … One of our key asks was an additional rent relief scheme that they put in place at the beginning of COVID.” As the government continues its review of the state's tenancy laws, renters will be waiting with bated breath to to see if it pulls other levers to help them out.

The Bunbury Outer Ring Road project has been allocated another $100 million — lifting the price tag of the road to $1.35 billion. It's initial cost was $852 million and now stands as WA's most expensive ever road project. The Albany Ring Road's budget has been increased by $40 million. $15 million will be added to the budget of the Great Northern Highway (Ord River North) project, while an extra $30 million has been reserved for the duplication of the Bussell Highway. No word on new Broome prison The implementation of a new prison in the Kimberley is no closer, with funding for an upgraded custodial facility in Broome not included in today’s budget, as promised. With the current Broome Regional Prison ageing and in need of replacement, the state government has been investigating potential sites to build a new facility. In February 2022, Corrective Services Minister Bill Johnston announced a preferred prison location in the Broome Road Industrial Park, 10km from the Broome townsite – and stipulated funding for construction would be considered as part of the 2023-24 budget. However, with a section of the Broome community calling for more consultation, the government has been forced back to the drawing board – with the absence of funding in today’s Budget delaying the long-awaited project further.",
