Over 4,300 residential buildings were flooded and 28 settlements cut off by floodwaters, with 16 of the region's districts affected. On Friday, local officials said the downpours had already caused floods in seven districts and killed at least three people — a woman and two children, ages 10 and 12. The rain was from the remnants of Typhoon Khanun, which earlier battered Japan and the Korean Peninsula. Reporting by Reuters.",

People we've spoken to say they didn't get a text warning about the fire either. Sean Taylor, an Australian resident of Maui, says it was basically \"word of mouth\". Mr Taylor, who runs a clothing business on the island, has been helping out getting supplies into the fire-impacted zone. He thinks the government should be doing more. \"100 per cent. \"As beautiful and as amazing as it is to see the community come together and do all of those things it's just like, 'Where's all the help?' \"I'm sure there's some red tape and all the policies that might have put a pause to all of that, but it was needed three days ago.\" Reina Nahulu, a teacher, says she thinks the government is doing a decent job. \"You know the way it happened, so quickly, I can see why everything was so unorganised.\" Reporting by North America correspondent Barbara Miller on Maui.",

              "plaintext": "Electronics and whitegoods retailing giant JB Hi-Fi (which also owns The Good Guys) has reported a fall in its full-year profit as cost increases outweighed price rises. The retailer posted a net profit after tax of $525 million, down 3.7% from $545 million last financial year, but JB Hi-Fi said that is still more than double its last full-year pre-COVID result of $250 million. Total sales were up 4.3% to $9.6 billion, with JB Hi-FI Australia accounting for more than two-thirds of that ($6.55 billion), while The Good Guys had sales of $2.81 billion, with the company's NZ operations filling in the rest. The story was the same across both JB Hi-Fi and The Good Guys, with sales still growing and gross margins — the difference between what the company pays for goods and the price it sells them at — also rising. The problem across the business was that the cost of sales also rose, and by more than the increase in gross margins. JB Hi-Fi Australia's cost of doing business jumped 0.68 of a percentage point to 12.1%, but the firm said it remained below pre-COVID levels. The Good Guys reported an even larger 1.04 percentage point jump in the cost of doing business to 12.8%, but again said it was lower than pre-COVID. But, while sales held up last financial year, they have been dropping off fairly sharply in recent months, pointing to even weaker results ahead. \"With JBH's share price over recent months generally holding up better than most other listed discretionary retailers — in our view weakening sales and earnings momentum and no material change to consensus forecasts expected — we expect the share price drift off following the FY23 result,\" noted E & P Capital retail analyst Phillip Kimber. JB Hi-Fi has reduced its final dividend by around a quarter, or 38 cents per share, to 115 cents. Its total full-year payout of 312 cents per share is down slightly on last financial year's record 316 cents payout, but up nearly 120% on pre-COVID. The result still pleased investors, with JB Hi-Fi shares up 2% to $48.17 by 10:18am AEST.",

Wall Street dipped on Friday as market interest rates rose slightly on news that the US Producer Price Index (PPI) accelerated very slightly in July. Producer prices reflect the cost of inputs for businesses and can be a leading indicator for consumer prices. \"The monthly gain in the core PPI was the largest since November last year,\" wrote NAB economist Taylor Nugent. \"Trade services, which reflect retail and wholesaler margins, rose in the month but at still elevated levels are likely to resume their recent downtrend, while spare capacity in the Chinese manufactured exports should keep downward pressure on goods prices. \"A downward revision to the previous month also didn't flatter the July outcome. \"Nonetheless, with the market increasingly confident of a soft landing, the upside surprise does highlight sensitivity to the risk of reacceleration so long as labour markets remain tight and demand remains resilient.\" Locally, the Wage Price Index for the June quarter out tomorrow from the ABS will be the key data point. \"We expect the 2Q wage price index to increase 0.9%q/q, one-tenth firmer than the prior quarter,\" wrote JP Morgan's Ben Jarman. \"This would leave the annual rate at 3.7%oya, matching the strongest pace of growth in the past decade and consistent with the RBA's forecast.\" An upside surprise could add to the risk the Reserve Bank will raise interest rates one more time, which would not be good news for consumer discretionary stocks already suffering from declining demand. Finally, the ABS labour force data on Thursday will give the latest update on just how resilient the Australian jobs market was last month.",
