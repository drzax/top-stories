The prime minister says it's unclear how many Australians are in both Israel and Gaza, and officials are working to check on the welfare of citizens in both areas.

No figures have yet been provided about the number of Australians in Gaza or other occupied Palestinian territories.

We are working very hard through the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to make sure that Australian citizens can be looked after.\" The United States is leading talks with Israel and Egypt about establishing a safe corridor out of Gaza into Egypt.

The head of Australia's domestic spy agency, ASIO, has warned the conflict between Israel and Gaza is \"resonating in the Australian community,\" although the local terror threat is unchanged. Director-general Mike Burgess has issued a rare public statement in the wake of fiery protests across Australia, noting such activities will continue \"and are likely to feature strong emotive claims\". He says ASIO is carefully monitoring the situation along with police. \"I remain concerned about the potential for opportunistic violence with little or no warning,\" Mr Burgess said. \"However, it is important to distinguish opportunistic violence from planned violence or acts of terrorism. \"ASIO remains well placed to detect threats to security including potential acts of politically motivated violence or the promotion of communal violence.\" Mr Burgess also urged people taking part in protests, and commenting on them, to be careful about the tone they strike, noting that \"words matter\". \"It is important that all parties consider the implications for social cohesion when making public statements. \"ASIO has seen direct connections between inflamed language and inflamed community tensions. \"As always, ASIO is not interested in those who are engaged in lawful protest, but rather the small subset of protesters who may wish to escalate protest to violence â this includes religiously motivated and ideologically motivated extremists, or anyone who believes that violence is a means to further their own interests.\"",

Price today cast her vote in the referendum at an early voting centre in Alice Springs alongside her husband, Colin Lillie. The Northern Territory senator has become a leading figure in the No camp, and is the federal shadow minister for Indigenous Australians. Speaking after casting her vote, Senator Price said she hopes the country will reunite after the referendum result on Saturday. \"No matter what the outcome is, Australia has gone through a pretty rough patch with this referendum ,\" she said. \"It's been the most divisive referendum that our nation has ever experienced and we really need to pull together again as a country.\"",

It's often seen as one of the more progressive states and for a while it was one of a few that was leaning towards a Yes majority in the polls. That's now changed, according to all but one opinion poll. They're now projecting a No vote will win in Victoria. It's worth noting opinion polls have their limitation and can be wrong (and have been in the past). I spoke to Victorian lobbyist and pollster Kos Samaras about why there has been a shift in the state. He told me it's being driven by Melbourne's outer suburbs, where the Yes campaign has been less visible (compared to inner city suburbs where the Yes vote is much higher) and where some voters aren't finding the case for voting Yes succinct or clear enough. Additionally, he said some areas with higher migrant populations in the state were only being handed campaign pamphlets in English. And Kos said that when people don't understand, they're more likely to vote No. But the Yes campaign is staying positive and they are hopeful the many undecided voters will be swayed towards a Yes in the coming days. I'll have more on 7.30 tonight.",

At one venue in the CBD, everyone who spoke to the ABC said they were voting Yes. Michael Morrow said while he was originally planning to vote No, some of the \"aggressive\" campaigning \"kind of put me off a little bit\". \"I just thought about and decided vote Yes,\" he said. He said he chatted to family about the referendum, but his decision was personal and \"wasn't really influenced by anybody else\". \"If it can help out, might as well [vote Yes],\" he said. Fiona Futo said she voted a \"definite Yes\" and held back tears as she spoke, saying she felt \"a little bit emotional about it\". \"I just think Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people have really suffered a lot â¦ just anything we can do to help make things better, I definitely want to support that ,\" she said. She said while she was unsure exactly how the Voice to Parliament would work, she trusted elected officials. \"It is quite confusing, but I don't know what happens in Parliament House, I don't know how our day-to-day decisions are made and all the processes that happen in government but I just trust that our elected government does know how all that works and that they have made a plan of how the Voice is going to work,\" she said. \"And I don't need to worry about that, I just need to know about whether or not I want to do the right thing to support Aboriginal people.\"",
