The 'time to buy a dwelling index' fell 5.7 per cent to 72, near historical lows. Westpac chief economist Bill Evans: \"While these are not the weakest index reads on record, the sixteen month run since March is easily the most prolonged period of very weak buyer sentiment we have seen since the survey began in 1974,\" he said. However, he noted people still expect home prices to rise over the next year despite last week's rate hike. \"Despite the unexpected increase in the cash rate, expectations for house prices remained firmly positive,\" he said. \"Over 60 per cent of consumers expect prices to rise over the next 12 months.\"",
