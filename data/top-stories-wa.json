Yesterday, news.com.au reported that the High Court had confirmed all of its judges were members of the Qantas Chairman's Lounge, ahead of this morning's ruling. But speaking to RN Breakfast this morning, the national secretary of the Transport Workers' Union, Michael Kaine, said the memberships were \"not an issue\" in their eyes. \"It's certainly not an issue from our perspective ,\" he said. \"We just don't think it's rational to take the position that the High Court judge, literally judges that are the most astute legal minds in our community, would be influenced by membership of the Chairman's Lounge in any decision. \"We just think it's not realistic to think that these judges would be influenced there. \"They are exercising their functions. They exercise them in an impeccable way. \"We may not agree with their decision, but it won't have anything to do with their membership at the Chairman's Lounge .\"",

Later this morning, Qantas will learn whether it's convinced the High Court it did not break the law when it sacked around 1,700 ground staff at the height of the pandemic. Earlier this year, Qantas told the High Court it had sound commercial reasons to sack the staff as it moved to outsource the jobs, in the face of a dramatic decline in the number of travellers. But the Transport Workers Union told the court Qantas sacked the workers to head off any industrial action, a move which is prohibited by the Fair Work Act. Qantas denies that was its motivation, and told the court the decision was necessary to save around $100 million a year as its business plummeted by more than 90%. The airline took the case to the High Court after l osing twice in the Federal Court, which ruled the outsourcing decision breached Fair Work laws. The final verdict will be handed down around 10am AEST.",

Speaking at the Australian Financial Review Property Summit in Sydney yesterday, billionaire property developer and founder of Gurner Group, Tim Gurner told the crowd he wants to see the unemployment rate \"jump 40-50% in my view\" and cause \"pain in the economy\" to \"remind people they work for the employer, not the other way around\". Since COVID, Gurner believes workers have become \"arrogant\" and that \"dynamic has to change\". To say it's prompted quite the negative reaction online would be an understatement. Here's his full spiel: \"I think the problem that we've had is that people decided they didn't really want to work so much anymore through COVID and that has had a massive issue on productivity. \"Tradies have definitely pulled back on productivity, they have been paid a lot to do not too much in the last few years, and we need to see that change. \"We need to see unemployment rise. Unemployment has to jump 40-50% in my view. \"We need to see pain in the economy. We need to remind people that they work for the employer, not the other way around. \"There's been a systematic change where employees feel the employer is extremely lucky to have them, as opposed to the other way around. \"So, it's a dynamic that has to change. We've gotta kill that attitude and that has to come through hurting the economy, which is what the whole global — the world — is trying to do. \"The governments around the world are trying to increase unemployment to get that to some sort of normality, and we're seeing it. I think every employer is now seeing it. \"I mean, there is definitely massive layoffs going off. People might not be talking about it, but people are definitely laying people off and we're starting to see less arrogance in the employment market and that has to continue, because that will cascade across the costs balance.\" You can also watch Gurner's full commentary below: (And, if you happen to be a Gurner Group employee ... you can send me an email at Ainsworth.Kate@abc.net.au or leave a comment with your contact details.)",
