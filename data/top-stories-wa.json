Offshore Alliance members from three Chevron gas facilities — Gorgon, Wheatstone Platform and Wheatstone Downstream — met at 7pm WA time to consider a recommendation put to both Chevron and Offshore Alliance members yesterday morning by Commissioner Riordan. The proposed enterprise agreements, which incorporate the commissioner's recommendations, contain substantial improvements in terms and conditions of employment including increased remuneration, job security, locked-in rosters, career progression and returning all employees to a 40 per cent roster. The Offshore Alliance will now work with Chevron to finalise the drafting of the three agreements and members will soon cease current industrial action. The Offshore Alliance is an alliance between The Australian Workers’ Union (AWU) and the Maritime Union of Australia (MUA). Offshore Alliance spokesperson, AWU WA secretary Brad Gandy, says Offshore Alliance members carefully considered Commissioner Riordan’s recommendation before endorsing it. “Commissioner Riordan’s recommendation contains substantial improvements in terms and conditions of employment, including increased remuneration, job security, locked-in rosters, career progression and returning all employees to a 40 per cent roster,” Mr Gandy says. “'The Offshore Alliance is a member-led union and at a late-night mass meeting members endorsed the latest offer, which incorporates the Fair Work Commission's recommendations. “The Offshore Alliance will now work with Chevron to finalise the drafting of the agreement and members will soon cease current industrial action.\"",
