              "plaintext": "Woodside Energy said it has approved the development of the $US7.2 billion ($10.5b) Trion ultra deepwater oil project in the Gulf of Mexico, which is expected to provide a strong and quick return on investment. Woodside (which is the 60% owner and operator of Trion) forecast its share of the capital expenditure at $US4.8 billion. The remainder is set to be funded by Mexican state-owned oil company Pemex, which owns 40% of Trion. The resource will be developed through a floating production unit (FPU) with an oil production capacity of 100,000 barrels per day, Woodside said. First production is targeted for 2028. The investment is expected to deliver an internal rate of return greater than 16% with a payback period of less than four years, Woodside said. Woodside, which has frequently found itself at the crosshairs of environmental groups and activist investors over their climate goals, said their greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets remain unchanged by the investment decision. Shares of the country's biggest independent oil and gas producer were up 2.1%, against a 0.7% gain in the broader market. The Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility (ACCR) was critical of Woodside's investment decision. âTrion will be a carbon emissions bomb, representing a 14% increase against Woodsideâs current estimated emissions,\" said Alex Hillman, lead analyst at ACCR. âThis decision tells investors exactly what Woodside is as a company: a pure play oil and gas producer denying that the world is decarbonising and without a credible transition strategy. âWoodside even states that Trionâs returns will be used to fund new oil and gas projects, indicating that no end is in sight for its hydrocarbon expansion plans.\" BHP, from whom the project was inherited, was aiming for a final decision on Trion in 2022 before its petroleum assets were merged with Woodside. But rising costs for manufacturing components for mega projects worldwide led to delays. Trion was discovered by Pemex in 2012. It is located at Mexico's Perdido basin, about 180 km off the Mexican coastline at a depth of 2,500 metres. Development of the project remains subject to regulatory approvals.",
