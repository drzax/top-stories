We are not sure whether soldiers are inside the hospital [buildings], but they are inside the complex with the tanks,\" said Khader Al Za'anoun, a reporter for the Palestinian news agency, Wafa. He said there were exhanges of gunfire in the hospital yard, and some windows of the building were out. The same journalist told the BBC that Israeli soldiers threw a smoke bomb before storming in and entering the hospital's specialised surgical department. Dr Munir al-Bursh, director-general of the Gaza health ministry, told Al Jazeera television that Israeli forces had raided the western side of the medical complex. \"There are big explosions and dust entered the areas where we are. We believe an explosion occurred inside the hospital,\" Dr Bursh said. Israel Defense Forces earlier said it was carrying out a \"precise and targeted operation\" in Al-Shifa. In its post on X, the IDF also said its forces include \"medical teams and Arabic speakers, who have undergone specified training to prepare for this complex and sensitive environment, with the intent that no harm is caused to the civilians being used by Hamas as human shields\". Hamas has repeatedly denied that its fighters operate out of hospital grounds.",

              "plaintext": "Australian shares touched an eight-week high on Wednesday, buoyed by a rally in mining and financial stocks, as falling US inflation data raised bets that the Federal Reserve would not consider hiking interest rates for now. The ASX 200 rose 1.6% to 7,121, by 12:23pm AEDT, its highest level since September 21. The benchmark was also on track for its biggest daily jump since July 13. Rate-pause bets got a boost as data on Tuesday showed US consumer prices were unchanged in October, while underlying inflation rose at the smallest annual pace in two years. In Australia, data showed third-quarter wage price index (seasonally adjusted) rose 4% annually, compared with 3.9% growth expected by a Reuters Poll. Gold stocks soared 3.4% to post their biggest intraday jump since January 4. Northern Star Resources advanced 4% and Evolution Mining surged 4.3%. ASX-listed shares of Newmont Corp rose 3.7%. Miners also climbed 3% to hit a 2-month high, drawing strength from higher iron ore prices as China's stimulus measures for its steel-heavy property sector lifted demand outlook. Rio Tinto jumped 3.4% and BHP Group advanced 2.2%. Rate-sensitive financial stocks extended gains, adding 0.5% and set for their sharpest climb since November 3. Meanwhile, energy stocks bucked the trend, falling by 0.1% as oil prices pared gains on signs tensions in the Middle East could be easing and uncertainty about US oil inventories. Heavyweights Santos fell 0.6%, while Woodside Energy was flat.
