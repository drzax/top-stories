The most recent ABS data showed that 33,000 people gained work in June, with hours worked also increasing — showing more Australians were working full-time. So what can we expect from today's data? Analysts from NAB and Commonwealth Bank are expecting a slight uptick in the unemployment rate, and expect it to return to 3.6%. CBA forecasts around 20,000 new jobs being created, while NAB expects employment growth to come in around 15,000. It's no secret that the RBA wants to see unemployment go higher, and noted that there were \"some signs that the labour market was at a turning point\". The RBA expects an unemployment rate of 3.9% by the fourth quarter, so a gradual lift between now and then is on the cards. All that said though, unemployment can be volatile, and it has defied just about everyone's expectations in the past — we'll find out whether that labour market resilience will continue a little later this morning.",

It was a disappointing night for the Matildas and that translated across to the foreign markets overnight. Wall Street finished lower, with the S & P 500, Dow Jones and Nasdaq all falling after the US Federal Reserve's minutes from their July meeting were released, which showed the central bank was divided on the way forward with interest rates. The Fed's policymakers unanimously agreed to lift interest rates to the 5.25-5.5% range in July to bring inflation down, but the minutes show that they remain open to the possibility of more rate rises. \"Most participants continued to see significant upside risks to inflation, which could require further tightening of monetary policy, \" the minutes noted. To say that was a downer for the markets would be an understatement — they had thought the Fed was done with rate rises, especially since US inflation figures are heading in the right direction. The Fed's next meeting isn't until mid-September though, and even with the release of the minutes overnight, investors are still expecting the central bank will leave rates unchanged. Meanwhile in the UK, their latest inflation figures came in as expected at 6.8% in July, down from 7.9% in June Back home and it appears that overseas negativity will be contagious, with futures trending down, suggesting the local market is in for another day in the red. And it's a big day for data — namely the latest unemployment figures, which will drop at 11:30am AEST. Plus we've also got more big company earnings coming out today, with Telstra, Blackmores and Amcor among those reporting. If you're feeling worse for wear this morning after staying up watching our Tillies (🙋‍♀️), consider this your permission slip to put an extra shot in your coffee before settling in to see how the day unfolds.",
