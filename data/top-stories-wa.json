But just how narrow a path is the bill facing? Republicans control the House by a very narrow 222-213 majority, so the bill will need their support to pass. But the problem lies with the fact that some Republicans object to significant parts of the legislation, despite teased out negotiations between McCarthy and US President Joe Biden. Democrats also object to significant chunks of the legislation. It is expected the bill will pass, but if it doesn't, it will increase the risk of the US heading to default. If it does pass, the bill will still have to pass through the Senate, where the Democrats have a majority.

Let's start overseas, where all eyes are on the US House of Representatives. They're sitting to decide the fate of the US debt ceiling bill that has been the subject of long, drawn out negotiations between US President Joe Biden and Republican House Speaker Kevin McCarthy as X-date edges closer. It's going to be a tight vote — and we can expect an outcome mid-morning here in Australia. In anticipation, Wall Street finished slightly lower, with labour data also weighing the possibility of a further US rate hike. Back home and the local share market is set to open lower as investors consider the possibility of higher interest rates, after monthly inflation jumped up more than economists were expecting to 6.8%. We saw the ASX fall yesterday in response to the data, but with the RBA's interest rate decision looming next Tuesday (it always comes around so quickly) they're now looking ahead to whether the central bank will pause, or potentially raise rates again. One thing that will be feeding into the RBA's decision making process next week is house prices, which have continued to strongly rebound. Let's get into it, shall we?",
