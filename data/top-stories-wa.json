The family repeatedly called triple-0 for medical assistance but they were eventually advised to take him to Gove District Hospital, a four hour drive along a unsealed dirt road. Respected elder Djambawa Marawili is the man's father in law. \"If whitefella, something happened to [them], the flying doctor [could have come] at once, but for us for Indigenous people, we have to wait around.\" Here's more on this exclusive story by Natasha MacFarlane.",
