The Gold Coast man, 45, has been charged with 136 counts of rape and 110 counts of sexual intercourse with a child under 10. AFP Assistant Commissioner Justine Gough says the AFP and its partner agencies never gave up trying to identify the alleged offender and the children involved. \"Given there were so many alleged images and videos of children recorded over 15 years on the alleged offender's devices, the process of identification took time, skill and determination,\" she says. \"While I am extremely proud of law enforcements' persistence and their unwavering dedication to identify this alleged offender, and stop further abuse, this is chilling news. \"It is with a heavy heart that the AFP and other law enforcement dedicate so much time and resources to prevent and take action against individuals who commit heinous crimes against children. \"There is not much solace I can give parents and children who have been identified under Operation Tenterfield, but I can tell you that we never gave up, and we never will when it comes to protecting children. \"This is a distressing time for families, carers and the community broadly.\" You can read more on this story at the link below.

Figures from the ABS show the fall was because of a substantial drop in volatile private dwellings excluding houses (apartments, townhouses, and semi-detached houses) — it was down 21% in June. Approvals for houses also decreased slightly, down 1.3% in June after rising 0.8% in May. New South Wales and Tasmania saw the biggest monthly reduction in total dwelling approvals, down 44.9% and 35.6% respectively. Total dwelling approvals however gained in Queensland, Victoria, Western Australia and South Australia. The head of construction statistics for the ABS, Daniel Rossi, said the average approval value of dwellings has continued to climb. \"The average approval value for new houses has continued to increase year-on-year since April 2021 ,\" he said. \"In June 2022 the average approval value for a new house was $409,900. \"Over the past 12 months this has risen by 12.5% to an average of $461,200 in June 2023. \"",

The value had fallen by 3.1% compared to the rate seen in May, but remains significantly higher than a year ago. The head of finance statistics for the ABS, Mish Tan, says the ongoing surge in refinancing is reflective of a higher interest rate environment. \"Refinancing activity has remained at record highs in recent months, as borrowers continued to switch lenders amid interest rate rises ,\" she said. \"The value of total refinancing between lenders was 12.6% higher in June compared to a year ago.\" The number of people taking out mortgages fell by 2.8% in June to a value of $15.9 billion, while investors taking out loans was up by 2.6% to $8.7 billion — however it is 15% lower than this time last year. There was also a 0.8% fall in first home buyers taking out mortgages in June. The ABS also noted that the number of loan commitments in June was around half of what was seen in January 2021 (which is when first home buyer lending peaked during the pandemic — only months after Philip Lowe first mentioned the RBA wasn't expecting to increase the cash rate for \"at least three years\").",
