              "plaintext": "In compiling the initial cost estimates, Mr Yates reveals EY was limited by the state government not providing for consultation with councils, the opportunity to visit sites or have access to design work. Senator Colbeck continues to push the representatives to comment on the final costs (which they weren't involved in providing), or detail an example of another project that had a similar capital cost blow out as the 2026 Commonwealth Games. They say they'll take the question on notice, and cite confidentiality obligations to their clients. Senator Henderson points to a figure in the business case referring to $205 million to $215 million to be provided by the federal government. YATES: That was an assumption that was directly given to us (by the Department of Jobs, Precincts and Regions). HENDERSON: Did the assumption have any basis of fact? YATES: Well, you'd have to ask the department what was the basis of its information … HENDERSON: Well hang on a minute … you're the one preparing the business case, don't you scrutinise the assumptions to be given? Do you ask the question 'was this a committed amount' or 'on what basis are we assuming that we will receive $205 million as a worst case and $215 million as a best case from the federal government?' YATES: That assumption was an assumption that was given to us. HENDERSON: You just take that at face value? You don't query it, you don't question it, you don't say well what's the basis for it? WALKER: We can't answer that question because to do so we might reveal information that's part of cabinet in-confidence. HENDERSON: Oh that's just rubbish! … That is just an absolute cop out.
