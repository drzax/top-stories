Is DFAT still advising Australians to move south? - D. I’m not sure what DFAT’s latest advice is — it would be on their website — but I do know that the south is likely to be less dangerous than the centre (Gaza City) and the north. I say “less dangerous” because no-where in Gaza is safe. It’s so small and there’s no-where to get away from the war. In geographic size it’s about half the size of Canberra with 2.3 million people. To put that into an Australian perspective, imagine putting the population of Brisbane (2.5 million) into half of Canberra. That’s how crowded it is. And then dropping 6,000 bombs on them over 10 days — that’s the Israeli army’s own figure. A convoy trying to get south a day ago was hit by an Israeli bomb — an estimated 70 people killed and 150 people injured. More than half of those killed children and women. This is without question a humanitarian disaster and, to quote Benjamin Netanyahu, this is only the beginning.",

The Israeli army says there are 155 hostages in Gaza. They come from several different countries. The US has sent its top hostage expert to Israel. I have no doubt that Israeli, US and several other intelligence services would be working full-time to try to locate the hostages.
