So over the year fuel prices increased as the fuel excise returned to its normal level. The fuel excise for petrol, diesel, and all other fuel and petroleum based products was halved for six months on March 30 2022 as a cost of living relief measure. That saw the rates for petrol and diesel fall from 44.2 cents to 22.1 cents a litre. Here is Michelle Marquardt, head of prices statistics, at the Bureau of Statistics. “It’s important to note that a significant contributor to the increase in the annual movement in April was automotive fuel.\" \"The halving of the fuel excise tax in April 2022, which was fully unwound in October 2022, is impacting the annual movement for April 2023.\" She says taking out volatile items like petrol and food means the monthly Consumer Price Index comes in at 6.5 per cent in April, lower than the 6.9 per cent recorded in March.",
