It comes after the federal government proposed new laws on Monday to close a loophole allowing employers to undercut workers with cheaper labour hire. The new laws would mean companies with more than 15 workers will be forced to pay labour hire staff the same wages as those engaged under enterprise agreements. \"Most companies don't use it, but Qantas is a company that has been using the labour hire loophole in a pretty extraordinary way. My objective is to make sure that people at Qantas are paid fairly. I look forward to working with the new CEO Vanessa Hudson. I also look forward to the legislation being passed, because all I want is this: when enterprise agreement rates are agreed to by Qantas, I want them to reflect what's paid at the workplace.\"",

The official was not authorised to address the matter publicly and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity. The news comes as the Kremlin tries to source military equipment for use in its war in Ukraine. The US official said they were not sure exactly where or when the meeting would take place, but the Pacific port city of Vladivostok would be a likely possibility given its relative proximity to North Korea. In a rare trip abroad, Kim would travel from Pyongyang, probably by armoured train to meet Putin, the New York Times reports, citing US and allied sources. At the meeting, the two leaders will discuss Kim sending Russia artillery shells and anti-tank missiles in exchange for Moscow's advanced technology for satellites and nuclear-powered submarines, the newspaper reports.",
