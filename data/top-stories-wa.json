Out of the top 200 companies, 136 were losing ground while only 57 companies were gaining, as of 1:10pm AEST. However, most of the falls were fairly modest, as investors seem to be waiting for some more clues about how the US debt ceiling crisis is likely to play out. US president Joe Biden and Republican congressional leaders are expected to meet again overnight (Australian time) to try and hammer out a deal to raise the ceiling and prevent default. In the meantime, around halfway through the trading day, the ASX 200 index was off around a quarter of a per cent at 7,261 points, with the All Ords off 0.3% at 7,449 .",

Do we sink with the great American ship? - Mitchell. Hi Mitchell, I just received a very relevant note from investment bank UBS, where its US chief economist Jonathan Pingle looks at exactly the question of what might happen if the US defaults. Here are some highlights (or lowlights might be the more apt term). But just remember, this is only the forecasts of economists at one investment bank and not any kind of financial advice. So UBS is already expecting the S & P 500 share index to drop 5% this quarter (to June 30) and finish the year flat as the US goes into recession. That's its baseline forecast. \"If the X-date is crossed without a formal default, we see the drop in Q2 deepening a further 5% to 3750, but proving temporary. \" A 1-week period of no coupon payment and default would trigger up to a 20% drop in stocks towards 3400, and keep them suppressed at those low levels through Q3 before making a partial recovery towards 3800 by year end. \"The very unlikely scenario of a month long non payment of coupon would not only cause an immediate drop of up to 30% in stocks, it would also see a very weak recovery, the S & P500 ending 5% below current levels even by end '24.\" Ouch. 20 per cent is a bear market, so any kind of default is likely to push US stocks straight into one, according to UBS. But a lot of that money is expected to go into, wait for it, US treasuries. Yes, the very thing that will have just defaulted. \" US yields will fall, not rise, even if the US defaults on its debt obligations. Treasuries\nflight-to-quality status comes more from liquidity than from credit quality, and the\ndownswing in the economic cycle should obscure the rise in term premia that likely follow missed coupons,\" Pingle writes. Here's Pingle's views on the prospects for currencies. \"Only a 1 month long impasse post the X-date is likely to cause a tightening of financing\nconditions sharp enough that it causes the dollar to rally strongly. In all other cases the\ndollar is likely to sell off amidst uncertainty. \"The worst case for the dollar is if the X-date is\ncrossed without default; de-dollarisation becomes a real threat in this case. JPY [Japanese yen] longs\nagainst AUD [Aussie dollar] and CAD [Canadian dollar] and Gold calls are the cleanest ways to hedge against a US\ndefault. We see Gold doing well through all levels of uncertainty and default .\" So that's the UBS economics team view. No doubt there are many other opinions on exact outcomes, but a strong analyst consensus that we'd be in for a very wild ride if the US passes the \"X date\" without a debt ceiling deal.",

              "plaintext": "The federal government is proposing the biggest regulatory shake-up in the fledgling buy now pay later (BNPL) sector's short history. The proposed changes would see BNPL services regulated as a credit product, albeit with a lighter touch than loans and credit cards. Block, the owner of Afterpay, was down -1.6% to $87.75 around 11:30am AEST. \"Today's announcement from the Government is a strong first step in the development of a fit-for-purpose Buy Now Pay Later regulatory framework that embeds effective consumer protections, generates positive outcomes for consumers and businesses, and provides certainty for industry,\" Afterpay said in a statement, adding that it wouldn't be doing any on-camera interviews at this stage. While it may have to overhaul it's operations in Australia to comply with some of the requirements around credit licensing and checks, the BNPL market here is a relatively small part of its global payments footprint. ASX-listed Humm Group has also welcomed the changes. \"hummgroup fully supports the Government's position to enhance consumer protection measures and has previously advocated for bringing BNPL within the application of the National Credit Code and the requirements associated with it,\" it said in a statement. \"In its submission to the Treasury Options Paper, hummgroup supported the requirement for BNPL providers to comply with responsible lending obligations which are calibrated to the level of risk of BNPL products and services (Option 2). \"The Company is particularly supportive of the requirements for BNPL companies to hold a credit licence, conduct scalable lending checks tailored to risk and have complaints and hardship policies in line with regulated products.\" Humm shares were up 1.2% to 42.5 cents by midday AEST. Zip, which already has an Australian Credit Licence (ACL), has welcomed the government's proposal. \"Zip has been advocating for fit for purpose regulation since as far back as 2019,\" said the company's co-founder Peter Gray told RN Breakfast. \"We generally believe it provides a sensible balance between consumer protection and minimum standards, but also supporting competition and innovation.\" Mr Gray said he doesn't foresee many changes to the way his firm operates and the regulation is \"likely to be a competitive advantage\" for the company, which would not cost it customers. \"For Zip, it's actually business as usual,\" he argued. \"We already hold an Australian Credit Licence, we do offer regulated credit. We have been conducting ID, credit, banking and affordability checks on all our customers.\" Zip investors disagreed, with its share price down 5.7% to $0.5425 around 11:30am AEST.
