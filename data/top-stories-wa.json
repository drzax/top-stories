What they have come up with certainly suggests a close one: \"The Pies will need to work out a way to lock down Brisbane's potent attack and turnover game in order to be triumphant. They'll have to do so while maximising space for their own dangerous forwards, like Jamie Elliott and Brody Mihocek. \"One way they might be able to hurt Brisbane is to limit their ability to gain ground from stoppages. When they are firing, they have arguably the best defensive midfield in the competition. \"The minor premiers know they can put it together against anyone on their day, but of course, they're up against the one team that has not allowed them to have those days this year.\" Check out the full grand final preview below.",
