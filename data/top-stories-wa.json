IAG disclosed the amount in a footnote, noting that 20 separate claims have commenced since February 2023, connected to \"trade credit insurance policies\" issued by Bond and Credit Co (BCC) on behalf of Insurance Australia Limited (IAL) to Greensill Capital and Greensill Bank. IAG owned a 50% share of BCC until early 2019. In the footnote, IAG denied it was liable \"in respect of the claims made against it under the purported Greensill policies\". \"A number a number of those claims are now the subject of complex litigation proceedings currently before the Federal Court of Australia and IAL is defending all of those proceedings ,\" the footnote read. \"IAG expects that these matters will not be resolved for a significant period of time and it is currently not known what the outcome of the proceedings or the actual value of any potential exposure to IAL will be if any claims are successful. \"IAG does not consider that the face value of the claimed amounts in the proceedings provide a meaningful indication of any potential exposure of IAL. \"If aggregated, these would amount to approximately $7 billion plus interest (applying exchange rates as at 31 July 2023).\" IAG also noted that some of the claims are unrelated to Greensill, which became insolvent in March 2021. The insurer also notes it has \" no net insurance exposure to trade credit policies sold through BCC\" due to protections its put in place.",

As of 3:15pm AEST, its stocks were down 33% — more than double the next worst performer, the A2 Milk Company. So what's the reason for its big fall today? It's all thanks to the tech company missing its earnings estimates. Iress posted a half-year net loss of $139.8 million, while its underlying net profit after tax was down almost a third to $24.4 million. And the company isn't expecting big changes in their second-half either, saying it expects \"softening revenue growth and cost pressures\" and has lowered its expectations accordingly. The company says the reason for its losses comes back to cost pressures, namely: increases in tech infrastructure, market data, and inflationary salary costs. Iress has also suspended its interim dividend. As for how bad their share price has been affected by the news? At one point, it fell to a 10-year low of $6.60 a share before picking back up in the middle of the day, but is now trading around the $6.70 mark .",
