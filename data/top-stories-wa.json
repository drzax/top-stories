Investors get an interim dividend of $US0.80 a share, down 27 per cent from the same time last year. Woodside says development of its major growth project, Scarborough, off the north-west coast of WA, is nearly 40 per cent complete.

We know we must do better and are resolved to strive for a return to leading safety performance.\"",

In late May, a North Korean rocket carrying a spy satellite plunged into the sea soon after liftoff, posing a setback to leader Kim Jong Un's push to establish a space-based surveillance system to better monitor the US and South Korea. North Korea vowed to make a second attempt after studying what went wrong with the first launch. Japan's coast guard said North Korean authorities notified it about a plan to launch a satellite from August 24 and the end of August 30. Coast guard spokesperson Hiromune Kikuchi said the notice didn't specify what type of satellite North Korea intends to launch but that he believes it possibly referrs to one similar to the spy satellite in the May launch.

The plan, approved two years ago by the Japanese government as crucial to further decommissioning efforts at the plant, has also been opposed by local fishing groups, who fear reputational damage and a threat to their livelihood. Japan has maintained that the water release is safe. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the UN nuclear watchdog, also greenlighted the plan in July saying it met international standards and the impact it would have on people and the environment was \"negligible.\" Japan says the water will be filtered to remove most radioactive elements except for tritium, an isotope of hydrogen that is difficult to separate from water. The treated water will be diluted to well below internationally approved levels of tritium before being released into the Pacific. Reporting by Reuters",
