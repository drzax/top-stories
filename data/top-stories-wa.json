Westpac's outgoing chief economist Bill Evans maintains his view that the RBA will raise the cash rate again by 0.25 percentage points next week — despite the weaker retail sales figures. He notes that the RBA will be \"guarded\" on the inflation data for the June quarter, and expects they will use that more detailed data to closely examine underlying, sticky inflation, the labour market, and productivity. \"If, as we consider likely, the RBA’s revised forecasts show little progress in this regard then the board should take out more 'insurance' with an additional 25bp rate hike at its August meeting,\" he wrote. \"A combination of one last hike in August complemented with the ongoing 'soft' tightening bias seems to be the best approach to a difficult challenge.\" That's also the view of the Commonwealth Bank, who also expect another 0.25 percentage point hike next week — but that it will be the last one the RBA will deliver this cycle. Senior economist Belinda Allen said, on balance, there were enough areas of concern. including rent and services inflation, the lack of wages data, and labour market data to convince the RBA to lift once more. \"Overall there is enough evidence to suggest the path of least regret for the RBA is  to lift the cash rate by 25bp to 4.35% in August ,\" she said. \"This should provide an offset to  any lingering risks in the inflation and wages outlook. \"We expect this to be the last rate hike of this cycle and for the RBA to be on hold  until 2024, when a new schedule of board meetings is introduced. \"Currently we  have the first rate cut in February, but the clear risk is a later start date to the easing  cycle, and less cuts in 2024 given the resilient labour market.\"",
