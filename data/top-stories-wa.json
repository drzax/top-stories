NAB's economists are making that call given their Business Survey showed that the retail industry outlook has recently softened. Meanwhile the economists over at the Commonwealth Bank are forecasting a flat outcome for retail trade. Here's their reasoning: \"While the May retail  figure was stronger than expected, this reflected the earlier timing of end  of financial year sales. \" We expect some pullback occurred in June, but if  sales events stretched into later weeks, the pullback could instead occur  in July. \"Our internal CBA card spending data indicate that retail spending  rose by 0.3% in June. \"While our spending data closely tracks the official  ABS estimates, it has been slightly stronger of late. \"This likely reflects  CBA banking a large share of new migrants, which adds to overall  spending on CBA cards.\"",

These are pretty important figures, and are the final economic piece of puzzle before the RBA meets on Tuesday to determine what to do with the cash rate. In May, the retail trade figure was up by 0.7% compared to April, and rose by 4.2% compared to May 2022 (when rate hikes began). So why do we care about these figures? Because if the numbers are on the hotter side, it's going to spark discussion around what the RBA will do with rates. At the moment, markets are expecting a pause at Tuesday's meeting, but if there's been a solid amount of growth in retail spending, that could be enough to change their thinking. But given we've also seen stronger employment figures, to paraphrase CommSec market analyst Tom Piotrowski speaking to Thomas Oriti on ABC News Radio this morning, they could feed into better retail spending outcomes. And if that happens, he says that will probably weaken markets on the back of investors weighing up a higher likelihood of higher interest rates after next week .",
