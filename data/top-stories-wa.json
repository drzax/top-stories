Here's Kate O'Halloran in Melbourne: It didn’t take long for Colombia - who had been peppering the goals in the first half - to find the back of the net after the resumption of play, with Usme scoring in the 51st minute. While all the attention in the lead-up to the game had been on 18-year-old star Caicedo, it was her fellow teenage debutant Guzman who set up the decisive goal with a wonderful, lofted pass. Colombia’s breakthrough immediately opened up the game, after Jamaica had initially stuck to the same formation and gameplan that had seen them keep three consecutive clean sheets in the group stages. Needing to score to stay alive, the Reggae Girlz sprung into action, almost leveling a couple of minutes later through Brown, who instead headed an excellent free kick from Blackwood into the post. From there, however, Jamaica looked out of answers, throwing everything at a Colombian defence that refused to yield. Colombia now advances to the quarter-finals, where they will meet fierce opposition in England. The Reggae Girlz, meanwhile, should hold their heads high after their best performance at a World Cup; one they remarkably had to crowdfund to get to in the first place.",
