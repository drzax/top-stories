The incident happened just before halftime, triggering a melee after outraged New Zealand players surrounded one of the Qatari players before a free kick. \"Michael Boxall was racially abused during the first half of the game by a Qatari player,\" New Zealand Football says. \"No official action was taken so the team have agreed not to come out for the second half of the match.\" The Qatar Football Association says New Zealand had withdrawn from the friendly without giving any further details. Referee Manuel Schuttengruber had a long discussion with New Zealand captain Joe Bell and soon after blew for halftime. New Zealand were leading 1-0 with a Marko Stamenic goal in the 16th minute.",
