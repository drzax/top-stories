The All Ordinaries and the ASX 200 remain more than 1 per cent higher, with some strong gains from the major miners, including BHP (+1.6%), as well as a good session for the banks, led by NAB (+1.6%). Real estate is the best performing sector, with Charter Hall Social Infrastructure REIT (+3.5%), HMC Capital (+3.4%) and Charter Hall Group (+3.3%) among the top movers. 162 of the top 200 stocks are in positive territory. The optimism on the local market and around the region has been fueled by the in-principle agreement reached to raise the US debt ceiling. But UBS chief US economist Jonathan Pingle says \"it's not over, until it's over.\" Mr Pingle says the fact that 'X-date', or the date when the government will run out of measures to meet its debts and could potentially default, has been moved to June 5, from June 1, has substantially reduced the odds of the worst case scenario being realised. \"The later X-date and agreement  being reached significantly lower the odds of negative market and economic impact.\"",
