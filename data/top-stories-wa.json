It's the third-straight day the ASX has closed higher, and it's also the best one-day rise its seen since early January — largely thanks to positive investor sentiment given the US inflation data. Real estate was the best performing sector for the day, up 3.3%, while academic services and basic materials gained 2.3%. Given how strong of a performance the ASX had today, it's not surprising to see all sectors finishing in positive territory, with utilities and healthcare reporting the lowest gains of 0.9% and 0.8% respectively. The best five performers for the day were: Imugene +9.9% Perseus Mining +8.1% Virgin Money UK +7.7% Evolution Mining +7.3% Regis Resources +6.3% The bottom five performers for the day went to: QBE Insurance Group -2.9% NIB Holdings -1.8% Medibank Private -1.5% Graincorp -1.4% Incitec Pivot -1.4% And that brings today's blog to a close — thanks for following along throughout the day.
