The incident on October 31 at a substation that provides power supply to the facility reduced output at one of the three LNG production trains at Gorgon to 80% of capacity, the spokesperson said. The company is working to return to full LNG production, he said. \"Domestic gas and the remaining two LNG production trains at Gorgon are unaffected and are producing at full rates,\" the spokesperson said. Gorgon exports LNG to customers across Asia and produces domestic gas for the Western Australian market. It has three LNG trains, or production units, with a total capacity of 15.6 million tons per year. It also has a domestic gas plant with the capacity to supply 300 terajoules of gas per day to Western Australia. Chevron is a 47 per cent owner and operator of the Gorgon project. It is also co-owned by Exxon Mobil, Shell and Japanese utilities Osaka Gas, Tokyo Gas and JERA. Earlier in September, Chevron Australia's Wheatstone gas facility suffered a fault affecting about 25 per cent of its LNG production. Full production resumed three days later.",

Robert Ewing, ABS head of business statistics, said the information media and telecommunications industry reported the largest monthly jump in business turnover. “The 3.2 per cent rise in turnover for the information media and telecommunications industry is a positive rebound from its 1.8 per cent fall last month and the industry is up 6.8 per cent annually. “Mining recorded the second largest rise in turnover (+2.8 per cent), but is down 15.4 per cent compared to September last year, as demand and prices for commodities such as coal and gas have fallen over the past 12 months,” Mr Ewing said. Construction businesses also saw an increase (+2.6 per cent) driven by heavy and civil engineering construction. The construction industry is up 21.1 per cent from the same time last year as engineering firms continue to work through a large pipeline of infrastructure projects. Manufacturing (-1.3 per cent), professional, scientific and technical services (-0.9 per cent), and arts and recreation services (-0.3 per cent) were the only industries to record falls in turnover.",
