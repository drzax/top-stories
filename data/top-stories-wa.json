Ramia Abdo Sultan told ABC Radio Sydney Mornings she has relatives sheltering at a UN-run school, which is taking 6000 people despite only having capacity for 1500 people. She says food is also scarce, with people at the shelter receiving 3 loaves of bread and 3 cups of water a day. \"In my lifetime, for all I've known it, I've never seen this unfold,\" Ms Abdo Sultan said. \"It's a situation of literally life or death for many who are surviving the massacre.\" Ms Abdo Sultan said she has patchy contact with her relatives who need to find solar-generated power to charge their phones. Ms Abdo Sultan says Australians who can leave Gaza have tried to exit through the Rafa crossing into Egypt but have not been able to get through multiple times. \"They've tried multiple times to leave … only to wait a couple of hours and to be left with no option but to return,\" Ms Abdo Sultan said. \"They feel like they have not had the same level of support and attention that anyone else around the world would have otherwise had.\"",

The strike left a \"large number of martyrs and injured\" at the compound of the Greek Orthodox Saint Porphyrius Church, the ministry said. The Israeli army told AFP it was checking the reported strike. Witnesses said the strike damaged the facade of the church and caused an adjacent building to collapse. Saint Porphyrius is the oldest church still in use in Gaza and is located in the city's historic neighbourhood. The Orthodox Patriarchate of Jerusalem expressed its \"strongest condemnation\" of the strike at its church compound. \"Targeting churches and their institutions, along with the shelters they provide to protect innocent citizens, especially children and women who have lost their homes due to Israeli airstrikes on residential areas over the past 13 days, constitutes a war crime that cannot be ignored,\" the Patriarchate said in a statement. Multiple posts circulating on social media in the last week have falsely claimed that the holy Christian site had become a casualty in the conflict. But the house of worship remained standing as of October 15. AFP",

Climate activists delayed the start of the speech, with about half a dozen protesters taking to the stage, unfurling a large banner and chanting. Security apparently dimmed the lights and removed Mr Powell from the room. But, let's get back to what he actually said. He acknowledged steady progress on slowing inflation and the role of rising yields. Treasury yields have soared recently on expectation rates will be kept higher for longer, which could slow the economy. \"We are attentive to recent data showing the resilience of economic growth and demand for labour. Additional evidence of persistently above-trend growth, or that tightness in the labour market is no longer easing, could put further progress on inflation at risk and could warrant further tightening of monetary polic y.\" Mr Powell also warned the Israel-Gaza war could impact the global economy. \"A range of uncertainties, both old and new, complicate our task of balancing the risk of tightening monetary policy too much against the risk of tightening too little,\" he said. He also referred to the US government's huge debt (US debt has increased to $US33 trillion!). \"We think that the US has an unsustainable path. Everyone knows that,\" Mr Powell said during the question and answer session. To sum up: the US economy's strength and continued tight labour markets could mean more rate rises are on the cards, however, the bond market is now doing some of the central bank's work for it (and might lessen the need for additional rate increases).",
