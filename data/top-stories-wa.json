There is a temporary relief centre set up at the Loch Sport Marina. \"If there are going to be impacts on Loch Sport, we expect the impacts to be on the immediate western end of town, and we've got lots of appliances from CFA and FRV and other agencies there to minimise any impact,\" Gillham says. \"There's a very narrow strip of vegetation that lies between the main road and the lake itself, and there is potential for the fire to move right along that strip and it'll come very close to those backyards of those homes that lie on that strip.\" He says authorities are not expecting significant impacts but they want the community to be alert. Conditions are expected to ease after the cool change at around 5pm AEDT.",

Several major indexes posted their biggest quarterly (and monthly) losses all year: So what's causing investors to get spooked? One factor is the comments that central bank officials, worldwide have made about the interest rate outlook. Earlier today, Federal Reserve vice-chair for supervision Michael Barr said he feels US rates are \"at or near\" a level that is sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation down to the Fed's 2% target. It is also likely, he told the Forecasters Club of New York, that rates will need to stay high for some time to bring inflation down to target, and he is confident the Fed will get that job done. Senior officials from the US, European, British and Australian central banks have recently made similar statements (reiterating that the next move on rates is \"data dependent\"), which aren't exactly groundbreaking. Investors are now beginning to take them more seriously, and are re-thinking their earlier expectations about rate cuts happening soon. Bond sell-off, stronger US greenback, weaker share markets So the \"higher for longer\" narrative has caused a sell-off in the government bond (or debt) market, which has pushed the US 10-year Treasury yield to its highest level in 16 years (around the time of the Global Financial Crisis). As the price of bonds fall, their yields go up (the price and yield move in opposite directions). It means the US government would need to pay higher interest, to entice more people to lend it money (by purchasing its Treasurey bonds). And that boosted the US dollar to its highest level since November last year (and weakened other currencies, like the Australian dollar, in the process). As more investors invest in the 'safe' greenback, they're pulling their money out of riskier assets (like the share market), which is why the ASX 200, S & P 500, Stoxx 600, Nikkei and other indexes suffered their worst quarters of the year.",
