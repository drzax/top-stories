A decision is imminent on whether the airline has been successful in overturning a decision of the full Federal Court, which exposed it to a mammoth compensation bill for laying off around 1,700 ground and baggage workers at 10 airports. The TWU told the court that Qantas sacked the workers to head off any industrial action — which is prohibited by the Fair Work Act, and denied by the airline. TWU's national secretary Michael Kaine says the ramifications of a successful appeal by the airline would be significant. \"What it will literally mean is that any company with a loud and proud intention could go out and say 'we are now sacking a workforce to prevent them from exercising their rights to bargain, their rights to take industrial action, to get better terms and conditions',\" he said.",

              "plaintext": "Overnight, shares in Alphabet (Google's parent company) fell by 1.2% as the US government's trial against Google got underway. The US Justice Department has accused Google of exploiting its dominance of the internet search market to lock out competitors and smother innovation, at the opening of the biggest antitrust trial in decades. Prosecutors allege Google rigged the market in its favour by paying billions of dollars to Apple and other businesses to be the default search engine on phones and web browsers. The US government's lawsuit, first filed in 2020, alleges the deals were intended by Google to be \"exclusionary\", which would deny its rivals access to search queries and clicks, and allow Google to entrench itself as the dominant search engine in the market. Government estimates suggest Google has a 90% market share in search in the US alone, and the deals mean there are billions of web queries sent Google's way every day — meaning users have less choice and there is less innovation as a result. But Google doesn't see it that way. It maintains that it hasn't violated antitrust laws, and the browser agreements were \"legitimate competition\" and didn't stop its rivals from developing their own search engines, or stop other companies from promoting them. Instead, Google argues that its product is simply better than those offered by other companies, and the makers of phones and web browsers simply set Google as their default search engine because it delivered the \"highest quality\" experience for their customers. It's the biggest antitrust trial since Microsoft was taken to court by US regulators in 1998. The trial in Washington DC is expected to last up to 10 weeks, but a ruling is unlikely until sometime in 2024 .",

Yesterday, news.com.au reported that the High Court had confirmed all of its judges were members of the Qantas Chairman's Lounge, ahead of this morning's ruling. But speaking to RN Breakfast this morning, the national secretary of the Transport Workers' Union, Michael Kaine, said the memberships were \"not an issue\" in their eyes. \"It's certainly not an issue from our perspective ,\" he said. \"We just don't think it's rational to take the position that the High Court judge, literally judges that are the most astute legal minds in our community, would be influenced by membership of the Chairman's Lounge in any decision. \"We just think it's not realistic to think that these judges would be influenced there. \"They are exercising their functions. They exercise them in an impeccable way. \"We may not agree with their decision, but it won't have anything to do with their membership at the Chairman's Lounge .\"",
