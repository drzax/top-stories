The 69-year-old was a child when his father Frank Houston began abusing Brett Sengstock in the 1970s. Houston later learned of his father's abuse and confronted him about it. Frank Houston confessed and was defrocked in late 1999. Brian Houston shared the news with other members of the national executive within the Assemblies of God churches during an urgent meeting at Sydney airport. Word of the elder Houston's confession eventually reached Mr Sengstock, but he could not remember who told him, telling the court \"it was gossip everywhere\". However, Houston did not report his father to police. He faced a local court hearing beginning in December, pleading not guilty to a charge of concealing a serious indictable offence, which stemmed from the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse. Magistrate Gareth Christofi is due to deliver a decision in Sydney's Downing Centre Local Court today. Reporting by AAP",
