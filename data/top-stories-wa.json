It called for urgent and extended humanitarian pauses in fighting between Israel and Palestinian Hamas militants in the Gaza Strip for a \"sufficient number of days\" to allow humanitarian aid access. The 15-member council saw four unsuccessful attempts to take action last month, to adopt a resolution that also calls for the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages held by Hamas. The United States, Russia and Britain, who are council veto-powers, abstained from the vote on the resolution drafted by Malta. The remaining 12 members voted in favor. Russia failed in a last minute bid to amend the resolution to include a call for an immediate humanitarian truce leading to a cessation of hostilities. The council stalemate has largely been centered on whether to call for a humanitarian pause or a ceasefire. A pause is generally considered less formal and shorter than a ceasefire, which has to be agreed by the warring parties. The United States has backed pauses, while Russia has pushed for a ceasefire. The resolution also does not condemn the actions of Hamas — a point of contention for Israel's ally, the United States, and Britain. The council called \"for urgent and extended humanitarian pauses and corridors throughout the Gaza Strip for a sufficient number of days to enable … the full, rapid, safe, and unhindered humanitarian access.\" The resolution demands compliance with international law, specifically the protection of civilians, especially children. It also calls on all parties not to deprive civilians in Gaza of basic services and humanitarian aid needed for their survival, welcomes the initial, limited deliveries of aid but calls for that to be increased.

Witnesses inside Al-Shifa say that Israeli troops went from building to building, searched between different departments including the basement of the surgical ward and questioned patients, Middle East correspondent Allyson Horn reports. \"Witnesses there have described the situation as tense but calm. There has been no reports of any shooting or gunfire inside those hospital buildings and no reports of anybody injured\", she said. The Gaza ministry of health has said that the patients who were questioned were terrified and that it's unacceptable for Israel to be operating inside a civilian hospital. \"Shifa hospital is still besieged. The occupation soldiers are still on the ground floor and the bedroom floor. They are searching employees, civilians, even the injured and the patients\", Dr Mohammad Zaqout from the Gazan health ministry said. \"Some of them were unclothed and placed in dehumanising and miserable conditions.\" In a statement, Israel said its troops were engaged in a gun battle with Hamas militants upon entering the hospital, and that several of those militants were killed. Israel has maintained that its raid is a targeted operation specifically aimed at Hamas infrastructure and weaponry, which the Israeli Defense Force claim to have found inside the hospital, but did not specify where. The IDF released footage of the weaponry they claim to have found but the ABC was not able to independently verify the video. Hamas has maintained that it does not use the hospital to shield its operations. Watch the full report below.",

The current draft under negotiation would demand \"immediate extended humanitarian pauses\" throughout the Gaza Strip to provide civilians with desperately needed aid. It also would demand that \"all parties\" comply with international humanitarian law that requires the protection for civilians, special protections for children and bans hostage-taking. But the draft, proposed by council member Malta, makes no mention of a ceasefire. It also doesn't refer to Hamas's terrorist attack on Israel on October 7 that killed around 1,200 people and took some 240 others hostage. Nor does it cite Israel's retaliatory air strikes and ground offensive in Gaza that the enclave's health ministry says has killed more than 11,000 Palestinians, two-thirds of them women and children. The 15-member council has been paralyzed since the war began by its internal divisions. This is especially the case between China and Russia, which want an immediate ceasefire, and the United States, Israel's closest ally that has called for humanitarian pauses but objects to any mention of a ceasefire. In the four previous tries, a Brazil-drafted resolution was vetoed by the United States, a US-drafted resolution was vetoed by Russia and China, and two Russian-drafted resolutions failed to get the minimum nine \"yes\" votes needed for adoption. Several council diplomats said the opposing sides were getting closer. The diplomats insisted on speaking anonymously because the negotiations are supposed to be private. The resolution under consideration says the humanitarian pauses should be: For a sufficient number of days to open corridors for unhindered access by UN, Red Cross and other aid workers to get water, electricity, fuel, food and medical supplies in Allow repair of essential infrastructure Enable urgent rescue and recovery efforts Richard Gowan, UN director for the International Crisis Group, said the Security Council has previously called for ceasefires in wars from the Balkans to Syria \"with little or no impact\". \"A UN ceasefire call would embarrass but not really constrain the Israelis,\" he said. \"But the US clearly feels that even such a symbolic move is too much of a political risk.\" AP",
