Benny Gantz, who joined Netanyahu's war cabinet from the opposition as part of an emergency government, said Mr Netanyahu must retract his comment. \"Avoiding responsibility and slinging mud at the time of war is a blow to the country,\" Mr Gantz wrote on social media platform X. After the public backlash, Mr Netanyahu posted on X that Hamas started a war \"because it wants to kill us all and not because of any argument within us .\" On Saturday, protesters gathered outside Netanyahu's residence, chanting \"Jail Now!\" in a public display of anger at the failures that led to the arrack. The protest, which coincided with a poll showing more than three-quarters of Israelis believe Mr Netanyahu should resign, underlined the growing public fury at their political and security leaders.",

The bank announced a $7.2 billion full-year net profit, up 26% on the previous financial year. Westpac's financial year runs to September 30, as does ANZ's and NAB's, which will be reporting their full-year results soon. The profit came on the back of a 5% increase in loans to $773 billion and a 2% rise in net interest margin (NIM) — basically the gap between what the bank pays to borrow money and the rates it lends it out at — to 1.95%. Excluding one-off and financial market moves, \"core NIM\" on the bank's lending jumped 12 basis points to 1.87%. The bank also received a big boost from a 36% jump in non-interest income to $3.33 billion. Westpac's improved profit came from a 77% surge in profits from its business banking division and a 54% rise in earnings for its institutional bank. Profits from its consumer banking division fell 7% on reduced margins, while deposits grew 2.5 times as fast as loans. Despite high inflation across the economy, Westpac managed to reduce its costs by 1%. However, one negative was a near doubling in loan impairment charges to $648 million, or 0.09% of loans. The bank will pay a 72 cent a share final dividend, taking the full-year payout to $1.42. The company will also return money to shareholders through buying back $1.5 billion of its shares .",

And we're back to the now common contradiction where bad news for the economy is good news for stocks. On Friday, US non-farm payroll data showed unemployment ticked up to 3.9% in October — it was just 3.4% as recently as April. \"History shows that if the unemployment rate rises half a percentage point, the economy tends to end up in a recession,\" observed NAB's senior FX strategist Rodrigo Catril. The rise in unemployment came off the back of a smaller-than-expected 150,000 increase in jobs, with more labour supply due to increased migration into the US. The data also showed a more than 200,000 increase in the number of workers who lost their job or finished a temporary contract last month. But rather than have markets worried about a recession and falling corporate profits, they rejoiced because it added weight to the narrative the US Federal Reserve is now done raising interest rates. The benchmark S & P 500 index gained 0.9% and the Nasdaq did even better. The US dollar sank, so that the Australian dollar is now back above 65 US cents for the first time since August. The Australian share market is set for a more muted gain, with the key ASX 200 futures index up just 0.2% to 7,000 points .",
