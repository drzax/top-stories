He says the Victorian firefighters we've been hearing about for a few days are arriving today - and there are 63 of them. \"So many Australians have been really pitching in to help each other over the last couple of years. That we do need to be careful not to tire people out too early in the season. I've been pleased to be able to tell you that today, we will see 63 Victorian firefighters arrive in Queensland to relieve some of those Queensland firefighters who've been hard at work for the last few weeks. \"One of the great things that we're seeing already is a high degree of of interstate cooperation. \"Yesterday, we saw a New South Wales aircraft used to help put out some of the fires just over the border in Queensland. We've now got reinforcements coming in from Victoria. And in the next few days, we'll actually welcome some of our friends from New Zealand who are going to provide relief as well. \"So I guess that's one of the upsides of these situations is that you do see the best of the Australian character with people helping each other out. And we really thank all of their states for helping out no matter where the events are occurring.\"",

He said yesterday was a tough day for our firefighters. \"In the last 24 hours we had about 80 fires in Queensland. \"The main fires of note which is Wallangarra which was a fast-moving fire yesterday afternoon that impacted on the town of Wallangarra, and cross-border operations with New South Wales because there was multiple fires both in Queensland and New South Wales. And we got joint operations going there, but we have had some damage at Wallangarra including some homes, but yet to confirm the detail about that. But residents were able to go home last night. Dalveen fire fuelled by dry and windy conditions Deputy Commissioner Wassing said the other fire of note is at Dalveen, near Warwick. \"We had very dry and very windy conditions overnight. And that is a very large fire now. We got an emergency warning on that fire and that will be a focus for us today and in coming days. He said today's conditions are far better for us in the south-west and south-east, but \"still very volatile and still somewhat unstable.\" Deputy Commissioner Wassing said QFES is confident the large fires in central Queensland, Carnarvon Gorge and Lowmead are being controlled by fire crews. Tara, as well, which was impacted heavily last week, is \"now into the relief and recovery stage\".",

I’ve been here watching the war inside Gaza. It means we’ve been able to see the evidence of Israeli’s constant bombardment into the north – building after building that is damaged or completely destroyed. The whole area looks like a big grey pile of ash, because any of the buildings that are left standing are covered in concrete dust. It’s actually pretty eerie to look at. Almost every few seconds, we hear the battle unfolding on the ground. War planes fly overhead and then we hear a huge explosion – we see a massive plume of smoke rise into the sky. Another airstrike. Suddenly there are several loud bangs close by. Israeli tanks stationed near the Gaza border are firing from the ground into the Strip. I see several bright flashes of light, as artillery is fired. I can hear machine guns as Hamas militants are locked in gun battle with Israeli troops on the ground. It sounds like it’s coming from the north but we can’t be sure because the Israeli military isn’t really telling us a lot of information of what’s happening on the ground.",
