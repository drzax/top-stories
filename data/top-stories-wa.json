That saw a threat to global growth removed and commodity price climb higher, sending the mining sector on the ASX up 2.2% and energy stocks up 1.1%. But the news wasn't so good for businesses who sell stuff closer to home. Retailers were generally hit by the Fair Work Commission's surprise 5.75% award wage increase. With employers asking for about 3.5-4% and unions asking for 7%, 5.75% is clearly closer to what the workers wanted rather than the bosses. That showed up in a 1.2% fall for consumer non-cyclicals (basically the big supermarkets), led by a 1.7% drop for Coles and 1.4% for Woolworths. Other retailers who rely on a lot of low-paid staff to sell things also dropped, with Lovisa down 3.2%, Retail Food Group off 1.8%, Flight Centre down 1.3% and Super Retail Group down 1%. Home furnishings company Adairs had the double whammy of an earnings downgrade and rising wage costs. It was down nearly 15% to $1.605. On the other hand, online retailers aren't nearly as affected. Kogan was up 4.6% to $4.53. Overall, big gains for the big miners ( BHP up 2.8% and Rio Tinto up 2.5% ) were enough to haul the ASX 200 index 0.5% higher to 7,145 points and the All Ords up 0.6% to 7,331 .",

While we were busy digesting the Fair Work Commission's minimum wage decision, the Bureau of Statistics released some new lending indicators data — aka the number and value of new housing loans.

The ABS figures also show there were fewer first home buyers who purchased a home, with the value of first home buyer loans down by 2.1% in April, and 16.4% over the year.
