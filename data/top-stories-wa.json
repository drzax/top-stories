Food sales increased by 5 per cent over the year to $48 billion as prices rose because of inflation. Gross margins increased but the supermarket chain says it saw higher rates of theft which contributed to stock loss. It has rolled out Scan Assist technology across 474 supermarkets to improve the accuracy of scanning. Increased investment in its Everyday Rewards scheme also offset higher margins. Overall sales rose by 5.7 per cent to $64.3 billion. Woolworths says cost increases in commodities, energy and labour led to above-trend price increases from suppliers during the year, especially in packaged products and dairy. Floods also affected fruit and vegetable prices, although availability and prices improved over the second half of the year. Department store Big W saw a bigger slowdown in spending particarly over the last months of the 2023 financial year. \"Increasingly customers are buying only what they need, which has seen a decline in items purchased compared to the prior year.\"",
