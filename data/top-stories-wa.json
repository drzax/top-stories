The ABC understands it happened weeks ago, well before the recent collection of resignations that have hit the troubled company. But he has now joined Tivan Limited (ASX: TVN), a small cap critical minerals company. Tivan informed the Australian Securities Exchange of Debelle's move this morning, saying he's agreed to join the board of Tivan in the role of non-executive director, effective as of 1 September 2023. \"After leaving the RBA, Dr Debelle worked at Fortescue Future Industries as CFO and non-executive director,\" the statement says. \"Other precious positions he has held include: the International Monetary Fund, Bank for International Settlements, Australian Treasury, visiting Professor of Economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, chair of the Global Foreign Exchange Committee, chair of the Council of Financial Regulators working group on Climate Finance, chair of the BIS Markets Committee.\" Tivan says Debelle has confirmed his intention to invest $25,000 in the company by way of a private placement of shares at a price of 7.2 cents, consistent with the investment made by his fellow directors in the placement announced on 12 July 2023. It says this is subject to the approval of shareholders at the Company's 2023 annual general meeting. Dr Debelle said in a statement: \"I am excited to join Tivan who are focused on realising the great opportunity Australia has in the green transition, particularly in the critical minerals space. I am looking forward to working with the team to further enhance Tivan's inclusive and sustainable approach to developing its resources to benefit the community and deliver value for its shareholders.\"",

He reminded viewers that millions of Australians will be able to get 60 days' worth of medicine on a single script from today. Some pharmacists opposed this measure and waged an aggressive campaign in the media to stop it happening, but they weren't able to. From today, nearly 100 common medicines listed on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS ) will have the option of a 60-day prescription. This means many patients can now receive twice the medication for the cost of a single prescription. But that's just the start. The changes are happening in 3 stages over 12 months and will apply to more than 300 medicines once completed on 1 September 2024. You can learn more about the changes here:",

It is packing winds of more than 200kph and is expected to move towards the coast of eastern Guangdong, the neighbouring province on the Chinese mainland. It could be among the five strongest typhoons to hit Guangdong since 1949, according to Chinese authorities. Saola is expected to skirt within 100km of Hong Kong on Friday night and Saturday morning, causing weather conditions to deteriorate rapidly, the city's weather observatory says. All schools in Hong Kong will be closed on Friday, despite being the first day of term for many, the government said. Hong Kong's Observatory says it expects heavy rain and violent winds while the city's water level is expected to \"rise appreciably\" until Saturday, with the potential for serious flooding. The city's flagship carrier Cathay Pacific says all flights in and out of Hong Kong between 2pm local time on Friday and 10am on Saturday have been cancelled.",
