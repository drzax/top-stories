The passengers, who paid as much as $US250,000 ($360,000) each for the journey to 3,810 meters below the surface, are believed to have signed liability waivers. A CBS reporter who made the trip with OceanGate Expeditions in July 2022 reported that the waiver he signed mentioned the possibility of death three times on the first page alone. Reuters could not independently confirm the terms of OceanGate's waivers. OceanGate did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Waivers are not always ironclad, and it is not uncommon for judges to reject them if there is evidence of gross negligence or hazards that were not fully disclosed. \"If there were aspects of the design or construction of this vessel that were kept from the passengers or it was knowingly operated despite information that it was not suitable for this dive, that would absolutely go against the validity of the waiver,\" said personal injury attorney and maritime law expert Matthew Shaffer. OceanGate could argue it was not grossly negligent and that the waivers apply because they fully described the dangers inherent in plumbing the deepest reaches of the ocean in a submersible the size of a minivan. The degree of any potential negligence and how that might impact the applicability of the waivers will depend on the causes of the disaster, which are still under investigation. \"There are so many different examples of what families might still have claims for despite the waivers, but until we know the cause we can't determine whether the waivers apply,\" said personal injury lawyer Joseph Low. The families could not be reached on Thursday. It is possible none of them will sue. Reporting by Reuters",

Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and his ministers are feeling the pressure after back to back rate rises - this was the 13th in a row, and will make it harder for homeowners in Britain already hit by sharp hikes in the cost of food and fuel. The Bank of England said its nine-member Monetary Policy Committee cautioned that wages growth would likely slow from here. It said inflation should ease later in the year, and higher interest rates were yet to really bite the many Britons on fixed-rate mortgages. \"There has been significant upside news in recent data that indicates more persistence in the inflation process, against the background of a tight labour market and continued resilience in demand,\" the MPC said in a statement after the meeting. It added that \"if there were to be evidence of more persistent pressures, then further tightening in monetary policy would be required.\"",

Treasury is consulting about making country-by-country tax reporting rules for multinational firms publicly available. Companies already report this information to tax authorities but have long warned against making it public. The change would require them to publicly report tax information on a country-by-country basis worldwide, as well as data that shows if authorities are targeting aggressive transfer pricing tactics used by multinationals. Business leaders warn the rules will mean Australia imposes some of the toughest disclosure rules in the world, over and above requirements already in place in the European Union. But Jason Ward, principal analyst at the Center for International Corporate Tax Accountability and Research, said disclosures would be an \"incredible data source\" for tax activists, shareholders and academics. All companies with global revenues over $1 billion that operate in Australia would need to list the tangible and intangible assets they hold in each jurisdiction with book values, according to the draft rules, scheduled to apply for income years beginning from July 1. But the proposed changes have now been delayed.",
