Volunteer crews from across outer Metropolitan Melbourne and Geelong are travelling to the fire front to assist local volunteers fighting the Briagolong and Loch Sport blazes. Country Fire Authority chief fire officer Jason Heffernan told ABC Victorian Mornings some reprieve was expected in the next couple of hours (from 10am AEDT). \"I'm most concerned about the [forecast] wind change,\" he said. \"We do know that when the frontal system comes through and there is that change, that it can occur very rapidly, and there's generally an increase in wind speeds when that happens. \"What was the flank of the fire this morning will become the head of that fire and head in the Glenaladale type direction.\" Power company Ausnet confirmed that around 2,000 properties were without power. Ausnet Spokesperson Nicci De Ryk said the company had workers ready to assess the damage once it was safe to do so. \"There might be one or two wire power poles that have been impacted, but because this is an active fire we can't gain access to check,\" she said. \"But we've certainly got the staff ready, we've got a helicopter ready as well.\" In Loch Sport, around 80 residents are taking shelter at the local pub. The manager of the town's Foodworks supermarket, Nicole, told ABC Victorian Mornings that residents were faring well. \"There's a lot stress, I must admit, of the fear of the unknown, basically,\" she said. \"Especially now the power's out, but we're trying to reassure people that things will be OK. \"We can see smoke and flames and you can hear the firies. \"We're at the middle of town and they're down at the start of town when you come in.\"",

Andy Gilham is the Incident Controller at Heyfield, overseeing firefighting efforts at both the Loch Sport and Briagolong fires. He said firefighters were prioritising work to save residents’ homes and critical public infrastructure. \"We expect to be hard at this and for the [Loch Sport] community to be on high levels of alert for the bulk of the day and into early evening,\" he told ABC Victorian Mornings. Mr Gilham said a south-westerly wind change forecast later in the day will put pressure on that community. He said the change in wind will provide an area of burnt ground which will help firefighting efforts. \"That's one of the area's there's been a lot of fuel modification works for this very reason,\" he said. Mr Gilham said the fire near Briagolong, which had grown to more than 17,000 hectares, had fire behaviour \"indices near the severe end [of the scale]\". \"It's still some 6 kilometres away from townships … but will still continue to impact on private property,\" he said. \"What we saw in the early hours of this morning was the exact replica of the weather conditions on Sunday. \"It’s still very active out there.\" Multiple schools and roads have closed across East Gippsland.",

Six Rural Fire Service members were in the truck when it rolled at a bend in White Rock Road. Three were able to get out, but three others needed to be removed by emergency services. RFS Inspector Ben Shepherd said it would be some time before those recovering in care at hospitals in Sydney and Orange will head home. \"There's various injuries from fractures of the legs and arms, also some fractured ribs and punctured lungs, so albeit that they are quite serious, thankfully nothing that is life threatening.\" Inspector Shepherd said it is always hard to process when colleagues are injured on the job. \"This can be a bit of a shock because we cast our memory back to those tragic circumstances obviously in 2019-20, so look it always hurts us both locally but also from a state-wide [level].\"",

CBS's The Late Show With Stephen Colbert, ABC's Jimmy Kimmel Live! and NBC's T he Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon were the first shows to leave the air when the writers strike began on May 2, and now will be among the first to return on Monday night. Comedian John Oliver got his first take on the strike out, exuberantly returning Sunday night to his Last Week Tonight show on HBO and delivering full-throated support for the strike. Oliver cheerily delivered a recap of stories from the last five months before getting serious, calling the strike \"an immensely difficult time\" for all those in the industry. \"To be clear, this strike happened for good reasons. Our industry has seen its workers severely squeezed in recent years,\" Oliver said. \"So, the writers guild went to strike and thankfully won. But, it took a lot of sacrifices from a lot of people to achieve that. \"I am also furious that it took the studios 148 days to achieve a deal they could have offered on day one,\" Oliver said. He added that he hopes the writers contract would give leverage to other entertainment industry guilds – as well as striking car workers and employees in other industries – to negotiate better deals. Network late-night hosts will have their returns later on Monday. The writers were allowed to return to work last week after the Writers Guild of America reached an agreement on a three-year contract with an alliance of the industry's biggest studios, streaming services and production companies.
