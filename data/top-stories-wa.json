Should Poland or other neighbouring countries be concerned, could Wagner be used in some shape or form to destabilise the immediate region? - Rafski Hi Rafski, thanks for your question. I've put it to our global affairs editor John Lyons, who writes: Hello Rakski - you're right to raise Poland. Poland is so heavily invested in what happens in Ukraine for many reasons. I don't think Wagner is a particular threat to Poland. I think the real threat to Poland is Russia's general aggression. One thing that really struck me being in Ukraine and Poland recently is how crowded is the highway from Poland with tanks and other military hardware. Poland has become crucial as a launching pad for the continuing defence of Ukraine.",

I've put your question to our global affairs editor John Lyons, who writes: Hi Josh - I don't think we know the future of Wagner. There are many unanswered questions out of the latest drama and this is one of them. We hear reports that some Wagner fighters are angry with Prigozhin that he didn't let them know about the rebellion but it's hard to read. My view is that Prigozhin still has influence over many of them, especially if he can keep paying them. He is something of a cult-like leader to many of them. So I think the key to the future of Wagner lies with with Prigozhin does. Does he go back to Africa where he has many clients for \"security services\" such as Mali, and much wealth from gold and diamond mines there? Or does he sit in Belarus and watch what happens at the top of the Kremlin? I tend to think he wants to stay around and see what opportunities there are for him in Moscow.",

I've put your question to our global affairs editor John Lyons who writes: Christa — intriguing question. I think the answer is it's hard to know. Because Putin is so hardline and ruthless, no-one has really wanted to show leadership qualities for fear that Putin might be threatened by them. People like Dmitry Medvedev have used the war to display their nationalist credentials, but hard to know. I think the various generals and oligarchs will be decisive in deciding who replaces Putin. Even now (because of the rebellion) I think behind the scenes there would be a lot of consideration of post-Putin scenarios, but most of this will be happening out of sight.",

Just confirming that is the logic here? - Tim. Hi Tim, You're one of a few keen commenters who have pointed this out. It sounds counterintuitive but you're right — that is exactly the logic here. RBA governor Philip Lowe told a Senate Estimates hearing in Canberra last month that higher interest rates will help alleviate some rental pressures in the short term because it would force people to \"economise\" on their housing — which translates to either living at home for longer, or getting housemates. Here's what he said: \"The way that this ends up fixing itself, unfortunately, is through higher housing prices and higher rents. \"Because as rents go up people decide not to move out of home, or you don't have that home office, you [get] a flatmate. \"The increase in supply can't happen immediately, but higher prices do lead people to economise on housing. \"That's the price mechanism at work. We need more people on average to live in each dwelling, and prices do that.\" Rents make up a solid chunk of the consumer price index (in fact, Mr Lowe says they're the \"single largest\" component) and expects rents will remain high for some time. Of course, long term we need to see an increase in housing supply — which Mr Lowe also acknowledged during Estimates. You can read the full story about Mr Lowe's justification for higher rents by my colleagues Gareth Hutchens and Rhiana Whitson below:",
