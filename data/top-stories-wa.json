The CommBank Household Spending Insights index rose 0.7% in August from July, which was flat. The index is based on 12 spending categories and uses payment data from about 7 million Commonwealth Bank customers (which comprises about 30% of Australian consumer transactions). A increase in the number of international students meant spending on education grew 2.8%, while the FIFA Women's World Cup and big-name concert tours pushed recreational spending up 1.9%. Higher petrol prices drove up spending on transport by about 2%. However, the annual rate of increases is significantly down from its peak of 18% last yea r. CBA Chief Economist Stephen Halmarick says annual spending growth remains subdued as households manage the increased cost of living. \"The effects of the 400bp of Reserve Bank of Australia interest rate rises is clearly reflected in a significant slowdown in annual household spending growth measured by the CommBank HSI Index. Monetary policy is now restrictive and financial conditions will continue to tighten in the months ahead on the lagged effect of RBA interest rate hikes and the fixed rate mortgage refinancing task. We continue to expect household spending to weaken further over the remainder of 2023 and into 2024.\" Households spent less on hospitality and utilities (reflecting the government rebates available for energy bills).",

After small gains in morning trade, Qantas shares were down 0.6% after lunch, and just in the last few minutes they're slowly creeping up about 0.2% to $5.59 (at 2.40pm AEST). We're interested in following the airline's share price today because of the landmark High Court decision this morning, that found Qantas illegally sacked 1,700 employees during COVID-19. All this has made me curious to check what's been happening with the Qantas share price during 2023. Turns out shares are down 18 per cent from the airline's peak price in March (at $6.80). Let's have a look in chart form:",
