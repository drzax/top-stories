Here's how some have reacted to the development. Stephen Smith, Deloitte Access Economics: By slugging Australians with a rate hike this Melbourne Cup Day, the RBA has shown it has backed the wrong horse. It's the rate rise the Australian economy didn't need. With a slowing economy, supply driven inflation, a more volatile geopolitical and global economic outlook, and past rate rises still to take full effect, mortgage holders and businesses seeking capital to invest will pay the price today. With increases to the cash rate only effective at reducing demand-led inflation, it is hard to see what a November rate hike achieves other than making it harder for Australians to pay their mortgage in the lead-up to Christmas. David Bassanese, chief economist at Betashares: The Federal Treasurer's public interventions to downplay the need for higher interest rates, moreover, likely only hardened the RBA's resolve — indeed, for the sake of being seen to be independent, it was even more important for the bank to raise interest rates today. The cruel irony of the current situation is that the more that households not affected by higher interest rates keep spending with abandon, the more RBA is forced to screw down on those that are affected. Only stronger fiscal policy would provide for a fairer burden of restraint but that seems very unlikely anytime soon. It also does not help that a lack of competitive pressure in some sectors — from groceries to travel — is likely keeping inflation stickier than would otherwise be the case. But again, measures to improve product market competition are nowhere to be seen. Brendan Rynne, chief economist at KPMG: In KPMG's view the RBA could have held for another month to assess the situation. There are enough market signals to suggest aggregate demand is continuing to decline. A softness is appearing in the labour market and is only likely to grow over the coming months; retail lending rates are rising due to increasing wholesale funding costs and the immediate impact associated with any cash rate rise is going to be disproportionately felt by the poorest in society — the cohort that are least adding to inflationary pressures in Australia. The economy is showing more signs that it is weakening because of past rate rises.",

Al-Haq, Al Mezan Centre for Human Rights and the Palestinian Centre for Human Rights said they are seeking \"access to all permits allowing the export of arms and weapons to Israel that have been granted by the Minister for Defence since 7 October\". \"Australia's role in exporting arms material to Israel must be exposed. If Australian-made weapons are being used against Palestinian civilians, our clients and the public deserve to know\", Rawan Arraf, Executive Director at the Australian Centre for International Justice (ACIJ), and solicitor for the Palestinian human rights groups said. \"Countries providing arms to enable Israel's brutal violence against the Palestinian people must be transparent. And Australia must not be complicit in that violence\", she said. \"We know that hundreds of permits have been issued in recent years, but the Australian government keeps the basic details secret: what items are being exported, who is making them, what are they used for?\" It is the first legal challenge attempting to shed light on arms exports permits in Australia, ACIJ said. \"We are seeing the makings of a genocide unfold in front of our eyes\", Issam Younis, Director General Secretary at Al Mezan Centre for Human Rights, said. \"If Australia is selling Israel the means to commit that genocide, it would not only be an unspeakable horror committed against the Palestinian people, it would breach Australia's obligations under international law and its own rules around arms exports.\" The ABC reached out to the Department of Defence for comment but has not received a response at the time of publication.",
