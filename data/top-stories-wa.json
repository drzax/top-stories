On Monday, Mr Jones told the Australian Financial Review that Qatar Airways was denied its request for additional flights into Australia in order to protect Qantas's profits — despite the airline posting a record pre-tax profit of $2.5 billion last financial year. But speaking on Sky News this morning, he said his comments had been \"misconstrued\". \"I made the completely uncontroversial statement that the Australian government wants to ensure our airline industry is viable and competitive, that it's delivering good services to customers,\" he said. \"A viable airline industry requires a profitable airline industry.\" When pushed by host Peter Stefanovic for a reason why the government rejected Qatar's application, Mr Jones reiterated that it was about about keeping \"all of our airline operators\" viable. \"This has got away over the last couple of days, and if it's attributed to comments I've made, I've made the uncontroversial comment that we need … all of our airline operators to be viable and profitable in this sector, viable and profitable in this country, he said. \" I'm not saying it's [so] profits [are] higher, I'm saying that the airline industry, all of the operators, need to be viable. We have seen in our history what happens when they're not. \"We see airlines going falling over, customers and workers … left high and dry, and we don't want to see that.\" You can read more of this story from political reporter Jake Evans below:",

The ACCC claims that Qantas kept selling tickets for the flights that were scheduled to depart between May and July 2022 for an average of more than two weeks after the cancellation of the flights — and in some cases, up to 47 days. The competition watchdog also alleges Qantas failed to notify existing ticketholders their flights had been cancelled for an average of 18 days, and up to 48 days, for more than 10,000 flights set to take off between May and July 2022. \"This conduct affected a substantial proportion of flights cancelled by Qantas between May to July 2022,\" the ACCC said. \"The ACCC alleges that for about 70% of cancelled flights, Qantas either continued to sell tickets for the flight on its website for two days or more, or delayed informing existing ticketholders that their flight was cancelled for two days or more, or both.\" Head of the ACCC, Gina Cass-Gottlieb, said the legal action against Qantas comes after a \"detailed investigation\" into the airline's flight cancellation practices. \"We allege that Qantas' conduct in continuing to sell tickets to cancelled flights, and not updating ticketholders about cancelled flights, left customers with less time to make alternative arrangements and may have led to them paying higher prices to fly at a particular time not knowing that flight had already been cancelled,\" she said. The investigation by the ACCC determined Qantas cancelled almost one in four flights between May and July 2022, with 15,000 out of 66,000 domestic and international flights from airports in Australia in Qantas's published schedule being cancelled. The ACCC's proceedings account for more than 10,000 of those flights. Qantas has been contacted for comment.",

The Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) has released its latest 10-year outlook, and is warning that the outlook for the national grid has worsened since February. AEMO says these reliability problems mean \"imminent and urgent investment\" is needed, or \"the reliability of the National Electricity Market (NEM) will be at risk. But it's not just South Australia and Victoria which are facing issues — the NEM includes all states and territories except for Western Australia and the Northern Territory. So what's behind the reliability problems? A lack of investment in renewable energy generation, storage and transmission as coal-fired power stations shut down. AEMO's chief executive Daniel Westerman says the forecast hotter and dryer summer ahead is a significant risk to the grid. \"Breaching the reliability standard doesn't necessarily mean that there will be blackouts ,\" he told AM. \"What it means is that there's not enough electricity supply to meet the standard and that more investment is needed, and that's what we're calling for. \"However, we are also saying that this summer, we'll see an elevated risk compared with recent years, and that is primarily because this summer is forecast to be hotter and drier than the last summers. \"But it's also because the reliability of our old coal fired generators is at historic lows and plant operators are telling us that that's unlikely to materially improve. \"Now, as you'd expect, for this summer, like every summer, AEMO, together with industry and governments are well underway with our preparation to manage these conditions, but we're flagging reliability risks to remain. \" You can read more about this story from political reporter Tom Lowrey below:",
