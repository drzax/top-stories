Earlier this month a jury in New York found Trump sexually abused Carroll and then defamed her by calling her a liar, but did not rape her. The jury awarded Carroll about $US5 million ($7.4 million) in compensatory and punitive damages. Carroll's lawyers have pointed to Trump's posts on Truth Social calling the verdict a \"disgrace\", and his criticism of Carroll on CNN on May 10 in arguing that she should be allowed to amend her earlier lawsuit. The lawsuit alleges Trump defamed her by denying the incident in 2019, while he was president. \"Trump's defamatory statements post-verdict show the depth of his malice toward Carroll since it is hard to imagine defamatory conduct that could possibly be more motivated by hatred, ill will or spite,\" Carroll's lawyers say. \"This conduct supports a very substantial punitive damages award.\" Carroll's proposed amended complaint seeks at least $US10 million ($15 million) in compensatory damages against Trump, plus punitive damages. Trump has already launched an appeal to the jury's findings.",
