The utilities and energy sectors were the big winners today, up 0.6% and 0.5% respectively. But it was less positive for real estate and industrials, down 0.5% each. The top performer of the day went to Downer EDI, fresh off the back of a deal with the Queensland government, while Link Administration was far and away the biggest loser after HESTA didn't renew its contract. Here's the top five performers of the day: Downer EDI +4.3% Life360 +3.8% Healius +2.9% Collins Foods +2.8% NRW Holdings +2.4% And the worst five performers were: Link Administration -13.9% Abacus Property Group -3.2% Centuria Industrial REIT -2.5% Bega Cheese -2.4% Hub24 -2.2% That's it for the blog for today, and for this week. Thanks for your company — we'll be back to do it all again from Monday morning, ahead of the RBA's looming interest rate decision on Tuesday, July 4. See you then!",

Not only that, but the net debt is down to $516.7 billion. That is quite the substantial turnaround — just last month, the federal government noted its cash underlying surplus was just $8.9 billion, whereas now it's a staggering $20.4 billion. It sure does make that modest $4.2 billion budget surplus we heard about on budget night much, much smaller in comparison. As economist Chris Richardson points out, the sudden appearance of funds comes at a time when the economy is slowing, and household budgets are feeling the strain. So why the big turnaround? \"The biggest contributor was that Treasury hadn’t fully allowed for the impact of war and inflation on the nation’s finances,\" Mr Richardson wrote.
