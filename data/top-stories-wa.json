Dr Muhanna says he has been able to send five critical patients to a specialist centre but still has 10 in the hospital and is struggling to move them. \"All the hospitals are overcrowded,\" he's told ABC News. \"Even if I want to coordinate with other hospitals, I can't. They have no beds. They're putting patients in the corridors. \"We have supplies for one-and-a-half months, but that's on regular days. In war days, the consumption increases more than 50 to 70 per cent. \"This storage of medications will last 10-14 days maximum. Local markets cannot deliver anything for us and we can't get anything from outside. \"We have enough fuel for four or five days maximum.
