They're literally in an Israeli cage and Israel is harming them yet again.\" She felt like the world, including Australia, was treating Palestinian life as totally worthless and people in Gaza were living in fear not knowing when bombardments would happen. \"This is the first time Israel is going into a bombardment campaign having already taken the green light from governments like the Australian Government and the United States and other world governments,\" she said. \"They got the green light to go in and commit the war crimes. That can I do whatever they want and I think this is the lowest point in the Australian history where it comes to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict.\" She also said she was now worried about losing contact with those inside Gaza. \"Everything is cut off,\" she said. \"I know the hospitals are struggling, saying they are unable to deal with especially the casualties. The death rate is shooting through the roof. A lot of families have been wiped out in the last 48 hours.\" Watch the video below as Australians share stories of what their families are experiencing in Israel and Gaza.",

As a pure midfielder, there is no better option in this year's draft. McKercher is a prolific ball winner both inside the contest and as an outside receiver, and has uses it well with his tidy left foot. But where McKercher really stands out is his speed and agility. Combine that with his willingness to take defenders on and find creative solutions on the field and you're looking at a midfielder with real hurt factor. Think of a Errol Gulden or Connor Rozee type, the sort of player that can impact at the stoppage but push forward for a goal or two a game. McKercher is fun to watch, because he'll very rarely take the boring and safe option. There has been some talk that teams might be a little put off by the Tasmania of it all, but McKercher has been at pains all year to stress he is keen to head to the mainland and is determined to be a one-club player wherever he ends up. McKercher is a top-three prospect and there is no way he'll slip out of the top five.",

Mr Barr said while many people remain undecided, he accepts the likelihood of a victory for the Yes campaign is slim. \"I'm a little apprehensive and a little sad about what I anticipate might be the result on Saturday,\" Mr Barr said. \" It's not over by any sense but clearly Yes is the underdog at this point .\" When the campaign began earlier this year, Mr Barr said he hoped the ACT would record the highest Yes vote of any jurisdiction. Today he said he still thought that would be the case. \" I'm still confident that that will be over 50 per cent of the vote, but it may not be the sort of levels of support that we saw for marriage equality.\" The ACT has had its own Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander elected body since 2008. Mr Barr said it had been \"instrumental\" in achieving better outcomes for Indigenous people in the ACT. \"It's not perfect, not every issue has been solved, and no one is suggesting that the Voice will be able to solve every single issue, but it is an important step forward,\" he said.",

It compares to a loss of $565.5 million in 2022. Revenue more than doubled to $5 billion, after a strong increase in customer demand for travel, despite cost of living pressure. CEO Jayne Hrdlicka says it is 'an important milestone' for the airline. \"By creating a systemically lower cost base and a conservative balance sheet as well as investing heavily in technology and our frontline, we are well positioned for the future,\" she said. Virgin Australia was purchased in 2020 for $3.5 billion by US private equity firm Bain Capital, after the airline was placed into voluntary administration. \"Our balance sheet is now considerably stronger and the cost base of the business has significantly improved from recent years,\" said Virgin's CFO Race Strauss. Earlier this year Bain Capital confirmed it is looking to relist Virgin Australia on the Australian Securities Exchange at some stage.",
