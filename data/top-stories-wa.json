Tony Gustavsson makes 10 changes overall, with all the big names back in action, headlined by Sam Kerr 's first start for Australia since before the World Cup (remember those times? Me neither). I'll admit, I'm a bit bummed not to see Clare Wheeler or Amy Sayer here after their impressive performances against Iran. It would've been a great opportunity to test them against a tougher opponent, while also seeing how they slot into a more experienced Matildas side. Buuuut... this is the team that 60,000+ fans in Perth (and hundreds of thousands more around the country) are here to see, in a game that they have to win in order to make their Olympic qualifying campaign a little bit smoother. So I'm certainly not complaining. Meanwhile, the Philippines are also starting with arguably their strongest line-up as well, spear-headed by the excellent Sarina Bolden who scored twice against Chinese Taipei last week (*cough* hello, A-League Women clubs? *cough*). It should be a great match. Who are you most looking forward to seeing, pals? And what are your predictions for tonight's match? Let me know in the comments!",

The day after the Iran game, the West Australian government announced that they'd be renaming the newly-built State Football Centre in Perth to the Sam Kerr Football Centre. Not to be dramatic, but that's probably the coolest thing to ever happen in the history of sport. Just sayin'. A day after that, she made her first media appearance in ages, where she revealed that while barely recovered from the left calf injury that kept her out of most of the World Cup, she actually went on to injure her right one in the third-placed play-off against Sweden. “I just kept playing, I didn’t care at that point,” Kerr said on Saturday. “I just kept running until the last minute. I didn’t even really know. I didn’t know until I got back to Chelsea two weeks later. \"I went on a holiday, just chilled. I knew it was sore, but didn’t think it was that sore. “It’s been difficult, to be honest. “I’ve just had a bit of an icky run the last two months, but now I’m back to getting back to full fitness, enjoying being back on the park, sick of being with the physios. I am back to being on the park every day, training, playing. \"And it was great [Chelsea coach] Emma [Hayes] let me have the time, but then I had to come back and start getting fit again, that’s for sure.” So that explains why she's been a bit MIA recently. But after a nice half-hour off the bench against Iran, and with this must-win game against the Philippines now in the balance, there is a chance we could see a bit more of Kerr tonight than we have for some time, especially as Tony Gustavsson had flagged some heavy rotation across these three games. Let's hope both her calves behave.",

A decade ago, the nation barely had an active women's national team. They trained on ripped-up local fields, scraped through regional competitions, and almost dropped out of the FIFA rankings altogether after not playing a single game for over a year. But, as with so many things in women's football, it was the mammoth work of a group of passionate volunteers - mostly in the USA, which has a huge Filipino community - who came to the rescue. They created a kind of informal scouting network, focusing largely on high schools and colleges in the USA, hosting try-outs and contacting players who had ancestral connections to the country. And over the last few years, that process has begun to produce results on the field. Not only did the Philippines make it to their first Asian Cup semi-final last year, but they also qualified for their first Women's World Cup just a few months ago. 18 of the 23 players who participated in the World Cup were born in the USA, with many emerging through the country's excellent college pathway. Coupled with the influence of a number of key individuals, including Filipino businessman Jeff Cheng and former Matildas boss Alen Stajcic, the team has slowly risen up the FIFA rankings to 44 in the world, and are well on their way to becoming one of the next-best teams in Asia. Now coached by Australian Mark Torcaso, who doubles as the head coach of Western United in the A-League Women, the Philippines knocked off Chinese Taipei 4-1 last week to come into this match against the Matildas riding a wave of confidence. Did you catch any of the Philippines' games during the World Cup (especially that historic win over New Zealand)? And do you reckon they'll pose a bigger test for the Matildas than maybe what we're expecting?",
