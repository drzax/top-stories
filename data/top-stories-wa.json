Mr Cook said that after six years as Mr McGowan’s number two, what the state needed more than ever was continuity. “We also need the leadership to take WA onto the next stage of fulfilling our government’s vision to diversify and grow the WA economy,” Mr Cook said in a statement. “If there is one thing that being the Member for Kwinana has taught me, it is that a strong economy needs to deliver for everybody. “As a born and bred Western Australian, I will always champion our state and all of the communities that make it the best place to live in Australia at every opportunity. “I will be putting myself forward to be the next Premier of Western Australia.” As a member of the United Workers Union, Mr Cook is a leading figure in the Labor party’s dominant left faction. Health Minister Amber-Jade Sanderson, who is touted as a potential leadership candidate too, is also part of the left faction. Mr Cook is the current minister for Tourism, Jobs and Trade, State Development, Commerce, and Science, and was previously Health Minister. He said it had been a privilege to serve alongside Mr McGowan. “Mark is a towering figure in Western Australian life whose dedication and service to our state will resonate for generations to come,” he said. “I had the rare opportunity to work together with the Premier in our unprecedented response to the COVID-19 epidemic. “His professionalism and work ethic has always been inspirational.\"",
