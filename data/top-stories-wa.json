You can find an early polling location near you using the AEC's 'Where Can I Vote?' tool. Below are the reasons why you can vote early in the Voice referendum: You are outside the electorate where you are enrolled to vote You are more than 8km from a polling place You are travelling You can't leave your workplace to vote You are seriously ill, infirm or due to give birth shortly (or are caring for someone who is) You are a patient in hospital and can't vote at the hospital You have religious beliefs that prevent you from attending a polling place You are in prison serving a sentence of less than three years or otherwise detained You are a silent elector You have a reasonable fear for your safety",

              "plaintext": "With petrol prices sticking well above $2 a litre in capital cities, the federal government is facing renewed pressure to step in and provide some relief for motorists by reinstating the fuel excise discount. The fuel excise is the tax on petrol and diesel that's levied by the federal government. It was cut by 22 cents a litre last year, but the Albanese government allowed it to expire. Yesterday the PM was asked if he'd consider cutting the excise again, to which Anthony Albanese said he doesn't make tax policy on the run. But energy economist at the Commonwealth Bank, Vivek Dhar says it isn't the tax that's keeping the prices high — it's all got to do with oil prices. \"We have seen OPEC+, which is a group of countries that control about 40 per cent of global supply, effectively reduce production which has led to this higher oil price environment ,\" he said. \"So that's been really the key driver of higher petrol prices, but what's made this situation worse has been the weakening in the Australian dollar .\" For those who are hoping for relief at the bowser, Mr Dhar says we can expect to be waiting a while. \"There has been an interesting drop in oil prices over the last in 2-3 trading sessions, that's been a 5% fall, so that will give some reprieve,\" he said. \"But our concern is any fall in oil prices will be almost mitigated by falls in the Australian dollar. \"We may be stuck in this petrol price environment of 2.10 to 2.20 a litre for the foreseeable future ... we're thinking [falls are] more a story for early 2024.\" — Reporting by political reporter Evelyn Manfield",

Chatham Homes has about 50 unfinished projects across Melbourne, Ballarat and Torquay. On Monday, owner Bradley Hall made the call to voluntarily liquidate the company and let go of 16 staff, citing challenging economic conditions. AS Advisory liquidator Andrew Schwartz says initial investigations show the business owes $2 million to 200 creditors, who are mostly tradespeople. Mr Schwartz says letters have been sent to clients and alternative builders are being contacted to complete unfinished builds.",
