She says the tragedy will resonate with the community for quite some time. \"Which is why Redland City Council spent most of yesterday making sure that we've got the appropriate resources on the island and on the mainland to wrap around the community and those people who are first responders or have been impacted by this tragic event,\" she says. Disaster chaplains and community support are made available to residents and a space has been set up for people who want to pay their respects or need assistance. Williams says the island, which is home to about 3,500 people, is a very small and tight-knit community. \"Everybody knows everybody and, at the same time, they're all there to make sure that they support each other,\" she says. \"I just think they are still reeling at this whole event. It's so tragic.\"",
