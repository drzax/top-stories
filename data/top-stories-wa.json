Princess Ibini, Sarah Hunter, and Mackenzie Hawkesby have all found themselves in dangerous positions, but Western's defenders have rallied quickly each time to prevent clear shots on target. There's gonna have to be a change for Vine at half-time, which could throw Sydney's system slightly out of whack and could give Western another crack to exploit."

After all its the biggest female sport on the planet - deb. You're right, Deb - if this new initiative is able to attract more fans and viewers to the A-League Women, and to women's football more generally, then it would arguably validate the decision by the APL to move the women's grand final to Sydney. One end of CommBank is already filling up with fans who look and sound awesome. I personally think it's a different dynamic when it comes to the A-League Men, but that's a conversation for another time."

Full-back Angie Beard, who twisted her ankle in the turf during that game, hasn't recovered in time to feature today at all. Mel Taranto has also been replaced by Danielle Steer. Chloe Logarzo seemingly hasn't got over the niggling foot injury that kept her out of the back-half of Western's regular season, which is a bit of a shame given her game-changing abilities. Who do you reckon comes out on top of this one, team? Will Western do another smash-and-grab over the Premiers? Or will Sydney FC be too good this time? Log in and let me know!"

As the newest expansion franchise, there were zero expectations that the club would be able to achieve anything as they found their feet with a squad made up largely of National Premier League players (with a couple superstars like World Cup winner Jess McDonald and Matilda Chloe Logarzo thrown in), many of whom had never played top-flight football before. Boy, did they prove us wrong. They started their inaugural season with a bang, defeating reigning Champions Melbourne Victory before going on a barn-storming run to lead the league for most of the season, in part thanks to Golden Boot winner Hannah Keane. They wobbled a little bit about half-way through, but managed to cling onto their spot in the top two and even knock Sydney out of the major semi-final a few weekends ago. It's a remarkable achievement for head coach Mark Torcaso and his new side, who could be the first expansion club since Melbourne City in 2015 to win the Championship. I wrote this feature about them a while back, which talks about how the club's connection with the NPLW - providing a clear, accessible pathway from the grassroots to the professional level - is how all future expansion sides should go about their business. What have you made of their season, folks? And who do you reckon will be key for them today?"

In a delightful full-circle moment, Tobin made her debut for the Sky Blues all the way back in the 2012-13 grand final, which the team went on to win 3-1 against Melbourne Victory. Since then, Tobin has been a mainstay in the club, watching it transform from a team overflowing with senior Matildas to one developing the next generation of them. Poetically, this afternoon marks her 100th appearance in the ALW. And while she hasn't gone on to hit the heights of some of her former team-mates, she represents the group of women who have played a huge role in getting the league - and the wider game - to where it is today. I had a chat with Nat at the grand final launch on Friday where we talked about just how far the ALW has come in the ten years she's been involved. She tells an excellent story about peeing behind a fence. You can read it below as we wait for kick-off:"

For those who aren't aware (or, like me, have buried the information deep down in your psyches to avoid a total footballing existential crisis), this is the first iteration of the A-Leagues' decision to sell the grand final hosting rights to Destination NSW for the next three seasons. This means that Western United - although they won their major semi-final - have had to travel to Sydney for the game they would otherwise have hosted in previous years. Western midfielder Emma Robers wasn't super stoked with the decision, telling media earlier this week: \"Especially being the new club, it would have been unbelievable to have a home grand final as a new team that's come into the competition and have all our family and friends there, continue to build this fan base that we're trying so hard to build. \"So, I think that is a big element of that, it's disappointing that it's not at home. \"I understand the financial side of it and the decision that went into that. But it's hard.\" Of all the issues that both the men's and women's A-Leagues have experienced this season, the grand final one has undoubtedly been the most controversial. Rusted-on fans of every club - including those in NSW - organised protests and boycotts across the ALM earlier in the season, though unfortunately their messaging got a little lost in a bucket of sand. From the APL's perspective, they want to make the grand finals a showpiece event: a kind of sporting tourist attraction aimed at casual or neutral football fans, with lots of activities and activations supposedly built around the games themselves, which they want to take place across a single weekend once the season calendars align. From the fans' perspective, the decision is a short-sighted cash-grab from a financially desperate competition, whose leaders are willing to throw out decades of tradition (i.e. the team that finishes highest gets to host the final) for a flash-in-the-pan appeal to people who don't really care about the leagues at all. Today's game will be the first test of the APL's decision: they're aiming to break the all-time ALW grand final attendance record, and have supposedly \"distributed\" in excess of 8,500 tickets already (whether they were sold or given away is unknown). Could it be a proof of concept if they happen to break the record? Would it be a different case if none of the teams in this grand final were actually from NSW? What do you think of the whole debacle? Log in and give me your hot takes."

My name is Sam Lewis and I'll be your host as five-time Premiers Sydney FC take on competition newbies Western United in the last game of the Dub's 15th (!!!) season. Narratives abound both on and off the pitch for these two sides (one of which is the location of this particular pitch itself, but more on that in a minute) as the ALW enters into its next era, bringing in more money, more teams, more players, more games, and more visibility in the wake of July's Women's World Cup. So as the teams warm up and fans begin to fill the stands, let's take a look at some of the bigger talking-points in today's match, across the season, and beyond."

Sydney FC come into the decider with the same starting XI as they had in their preliminary final against Melbourne Victory last week, with Nat Tobin ticking over into her 100th game. Western United, meanwhile, have made two changes from their major semi-final win over the Sky Blues two weeks ago. Full-back Angie Beard, who twisted her ankle in the turf during that game, hasn't recovered in time to feature today at all. Mel Taranto has also been replaced by Danielle Steer. Chloe Logarzo seemingly hasn't got over the niggling foot injury that kept her out of the back-half of Western's regular season, which is a bit of a shame given her game-changing abilities. Who do you reckon comes out on top of this one, team? Will Western do another smash-and-grab over the Premiers? Or will Sydney FC be too good this time? Log in and let me know!",

As the newest expansion franchise, there were zero expectations that the club would be able to achieve anything as they found their feet with a squad made up largely of National Premier League players (with a couple superstars like World Cup winner Jess McDonald and Matilda Chloe Logarzo thrown in), many of whom had never played top-flight football before. Boy, did they prove us wrong. They started their inaugural season with a bang, defeating reigning Champions Melbourne Victory before going on a barn-storming run to lead the league for most of the season, in part thanks to Golden Boot winner Hannah Keane. They wobbled a little bit about half-way through, but managed to cling onto their spot in the top two and even knock Sydney out of the major semi-final a few weekends ago. It's a remarkable achievement for head coach Mark Torcaso and his new side, who could be the first expansion club since Melbourne City in 2015 to win the Championship. I wrote this feature about them a while back, which talks about how the club's connection with the NPLW - providing a clear, accessible pathway from the grassroots to the professional level - is how all future expansion sides should go about their business. What have you made of their season, folks? And who do you reckon will be key for them today?",

In a delightful full-circle moment, Tobin made her debut for the Sky Blues all the way back in the 2012-13 grand final, which the team went on to win 3-1 against Melbourne Victory. Since then, Tobin has been a mainstay in the club, watching it transform from a team overflowing with senior Matildas to one developing the next generation of them. Poetically, this afternoon marks her 100th appearance in the ALW. And while she hasn't gone on to hit the heights of some of her former team-mates, she represents the group of women who have played a huge role in getting the league - and the wider game - to where it is today. I had a chat with Nat at the grand final launch on Friday where we talked about just how far the ALW has come in the ten years she's been involved. She tells an excellent story about peeing behind a fence. You can read it below as we wait for kick-off:",

For those who aren't aware (or, like me, have buried the information deep down in your psyches to avoid a total footballing existential crisis), this is the first iteration of the A-Leagues' decision to sell the grand final hosting rights to Destination NSW for the next three seasons. This means that Western United - although they won their major semi-final - have had to travel to Sydney for the game they would otherwise have hosted in previous years. Western midfielder Emma Robers wasn't super stoked with the decision, telling media earlier this week: \"Especially being the new club, it would have been unbelievable to have a home grand final as a new team that's come into the competition and have all our family and friends there, continue to build this fan base that we're trying so hard to build. \"So, I think that is a big element of that, it's disappointing that it's not at home. \"I understand the financial side of it and the decision that went into that. But it's hard.\" Of all the issues that both the men's and women's A-Leagues have experienced this season, the grand final one has undoubtedly been the most controversial. Rusted-on fans of every club - including those in NSW - organised protests and boycotts across the ALM earlier in the season, though unfortunately their messaging got a little lost in a bucket of sand. From the APL's perspective, they want to make the grand finals a showpiece event: a kind of sporting tourist attraction aimed at casual or neutral football fans, with lots of activities and activations supposedly built around the games themselves, which they want to take place across a single weekend once the season calendars align. From the fans' perspective, the decision is a short-sighted cash-grab from a financially desperate competition, whose leaders are willing to throw out decades of tradition (i.e. the team that finishes highest gets to host the final) for a flash-in-the-pan appeal to people who don't really care about the leagues at all. Today's game will be the first test of the APL's decision: they're aiming to break the all-time ALW grand final attendance record, and have supposedly \"distributed\" in excess of 8,500 tickets already (whether they were sold or given away is unknown). Could it be a proof of concept if they happen to break the record? Would it be a different case if none of the teams in this grand final were actually from NSW? What do you think of the whole debacle? Log in and give me your hot takes.",

The extended stoppage-time reflects how crash-and-bash it's been, with several players hobbling off while gripping at various parts of their bruised bodies. As expected, Sydney FC have dominated possession, territory, passes, corners, and shots on target, though Western haven't been totally out of it - particularly not in transition through the excellent and hungry Hannah Keane. 45 minutes to go. How does this one end, friends? Does Sydney add to their tally, or simply hold on? Can Western claw one back? Who will stand up and be the hero for their side?",
