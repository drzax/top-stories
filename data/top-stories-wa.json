The federal treasurer has refused to confirm whether JobSeeker payments for people over 55 will be lifted for the first time in a decade. Federal Treasurer Jim Chalmers said unemployed women over 55 were the most vulnerable cohort in Australian society and the government wanted to introduce specific measures to help them. But he did not rule out the change, saying instead those details would be confirmed next week. The federal government has been under pressure to lift JobSeeker, including from its own backbench.

A further $10.1 million will be put towards improving the communications network used by first responders. Emergency Services Minister Murray Watt tells ABC News Breakfast that people in disaster areas say they hadn't received emergency messages quickly enough in the past. \"In some case they're sent to the wrong area. They might have the wrong phone provider and then not receive a message,\" he says. \"So that's what this national messaging system is all about — having one system across the country that can effectively override a mobile phone system and deliver people very targetted, very quick messages.\" The government says the emergency messages will be easy to tell apart from scam messages. You can read more about the plan for the National Messaging System, below."

Permanent ADF members will supposedly be eligible to receive a $50,000 bonus payment near the end of their initial mandatory period of service, if they commit to the military for another three years. Under the scheme, 3,400 personnel will be able to benefit within the first three years. The government has identified ­recruitment and retention of personnel as an immediate priority in response to the defence strategic review."

US General Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said in November that Russia had suffered well over 100,000 killed or wounded in the first eight months of the war. The new figures suggest that Russian losses have dramatically accelerated in recent months. The fiercest recent battles in Ukraine have been in the eastern Donetsk region, where Russia is struggling to encircle the city of Bakhmut."

The Rock & Roll Hall of Fame band have announced the dates for their Peace Out farewell tour, which begins in September and includes 40 shows across the US and Canada. \"I think it's about time,\" guitarist Joe Perry said in an interview with The Associated Press. Perry believes the time to say goodbye is now, especially with every founding band member over the age of 70. Frontman Steven Tyler, 75, is the oldest in the group. \"It's kind of a chance to celebrate the 50 years we've been out here,\" Perry said. \"You never know how much longer everybody's going to be healthy to do this. … It's been a while since we've actually done a real tour. We did that run in Vegas, which was great. It was fun, but (we're) kind of anxious to get back on the road.\""

The Government will allocate $234 million in next week's budget to reduce harm caused by tobacco and vaping products, including to stop the importation of non-prescription vapes. Under the changes, all general practitioners will be able to prescribe flavour-free, plain packaged vapes to patients working to quit smoking. Speaking on Q & A last night, Butler said easy access to vapes had created a new generation of nicotine addicts. \"This is now the number one behavioural issue in high schools and it's rapidly becoming a serious behavioural issue in primary schools,\" he said. \"This is a very serious problem we're facing and it has exploded over the last few years. While we were focused on the pandemic, it has utterly exploded and we've got to deal with it now.\" Butler is expected to further detail the government's plans during a speech at the National Press Club from 12:30pm today ."

On Monday, a heavy presence of police converged in an area where police had reported a possible sighting of the suspect, but later 38-year-old Francisco Oropeza wasn't found despite a search by officers, scent-tracking dogs and aerial police. The false alarm was one of the first times since Friday's shooting in the rural town of Cleveland that authorities had announced a possible sighting of Oropeza. By Sunday evening, authorities said more than 250 officers from multiple jurisdictions had joined the search, and Texas Governor Greg Abbott put up $US50,000 ($75,000) in reward money for tips leading to Oropeza's capture. \"I can tell you right now, we have zero leads,\" said James Smith, the FBI special agent in charge."

Other items up for auction include a tunic worn by Superman in the 1950s TV series, barware from Mad Men, and costumes from Star Trek. Comisar had dreamed of creating a museum to house his collection, but when that failed to come together, he decided it was time the items leave the temperature-controlled warehouses where he's been caring for them. \"I just decided these pieces should go back to the fans and let them enjoy them and then when that good day comes when a TV museum is effectuated, these pieces will be well cared for in the hands of passionate fans and collectors,\" he said."

They might have the wrong phone provider and then not receive a message,\" he says. \"So that's what this national messaging system is all about — having one system across the country that can effectively override a mobile phone system and deliver people very targetted, very quick messages.\" The government says the emergency messages will be easy to tell apart from scam messages.

Permanent ADF members will supposedly be eligible to receive a $50,000 bonus payment near the end of their initial mandatory period of service, if they commit to the military for another three years. Under the scheme, 3,400 personnel will be able to benefit within the first three years. The government has identified ­recruitment and retention of personnel as an immediate priority in response to the defence strategic review.",

The RBA kept the cash rate at 3.6 per cent in April after 10 hikes in a row to tame inflation. Consumer prices rose 7 per cent over the year to March, down from 7.8 per cent — but that's still higher than the RBA's 2 to 3 per cent target. RBA Governor Philip Lowe has not ruled out further rate hikes. The market is predicting that rates will likely remain on hold when the RBA board makes its announcement at 2:30pm today, but it's not official until it's official.",

The Rock & Roll Hall of Fame band have announced the dates for their Peace Out farewell tour, which begins in September and includes 40 shows across the US and Canada. \"I think it's about time,\" guitarist Joe Perry said in an interview with The Associated Press. Perry believes the time to say goodbye is now, especially with every founding band member over the age of 70. Frontman Steven Tyler, 75, is the oldest in the group. \"It's kind of a chance to celebrate the 50 years we've been out here,\" Perry said. \"You never know how much longer everybody's going to be healthy to do this. … It's been a while since we've actually done a real tour. We did that run in Vegas, which was great. It was fun, but (we're) kind of anxious to get back on the road.\"",

Under the changes, all general practitioners will be able to prescribe flavour-free, plain packaged vapes to patients working to quit smoking. Speaking on Q & A last night, Butler said easy access to vapes had created a new generation of nicotine addicts. \"This is now the number one behavioural issue in high schools and it's rapidly becoming a serious behavioural issue in primary schools,\" he said. \"This is a very serious problem we're facing and it has exploded over the last few years. While we were focused on the pandemic, it has utterly exploded and we've got to deal with it now.\" Butler is expected to further detail the government's plans during a speech at the National Press Club from 12:30pm today .",

On Monday, a heavy presence of police converged in an area where police had reported a possible sighting of the suspect, but later 38-year-old Francisco Oropeza wasn't found despite a search by officers, scent-tracking dogs and aerial police. The false alarm was one of the first times since Friday's shooting in the rural town of Cleveland that authorities had announced a possible sighting of Oropeza. By Sunday evening, authorities said more than 250 officers from multiple jurisdictions had joined the search, and Texas Governor Greg Abbott put up $US50,000 ($75,000) in reward money for tips leading to Oropeza's capture. \"I can tell you right now, we have zero leads,\" said James Smith, the FBI special agent in charge.",

A number of props, sets and costumes from beloved television shows will be sold in early June — from the bar where Sam Malone greeted customers on Cheers, to the pink outfit Barbara Eden wore in I Dream of Jeannie, to props used on the set of Breaking Bad. Other items up for auction include a tunic worn by Superman in the 1950s TV series, barware from Mad Men, and costumes from Star Trek. Comisar had dreamed of creating a museum to house his collection, but when that failed to come together, he decided it was time the items leave the temperature-controlled warehouses where he's been caring for them. \"I just decided these pieces should go back to the fans and let them enjoy them and then when that good day comes when a TV museum is effectuated, these pieces will be well cared for in the hands of passionate fans and collectors,\" he said.",

The RBA kept the cash rate at 3.6 per cent in April after 10 hikes in a row to tame inflation. Consumer prices rose 7 per cent over the year to March, down from 7.8 per cent — but that's still higher than the RBA's 2 to 3 per cent target. RBA Governor Philip Lowe has not ruled out further rate hikes. The market is predicting that rates will likely remain on hold when the RBA board makes its announcement at 2:30pm today, but it's not official until it's official.",

Every capital city, with the exception of Darwin, saw a rise in real estate prices, led by Sydney. Regional areas also saw some minor gains. But against all logic and what previous experience has shown us, house prices appear to have not just stabilised but turned a corner.

                  "headline": "ASX set to slip as Reserve Bank rates decision looms",
                  "articleBody": "Good morning, it's Tuesday May 2 and you've found yourself on the ABC's markets and business blog — and what a day we have in front of us. Let's get the elephant in the room out of the way first: it's rates day. The RBA is meeting today to decide what to do with the cash rate, after leaving rates on hold at 3.6% in April. But we know that was a lineball call — in the meeting minutes published a couple of weeks later, the RBA board had considered another rise of 0.25 percentage points. So what could today's decision look like? Major banks and investors are widely predicting the RBA will leave the cash rate unchanged at 3.6%, with data last week showing inflation is slowly coming down. I'll bring you the latest on that decision when it happens at 2:30pm AEST, and all the reaction that follows. On the markets front, the Australian share market is looking to open lower this morning after ASX futures were down -0.7% to 7,336 points as of 7:30am. It follows a mixed performance on Wall Street overnight, with US financial markets largely dominated by the news that regulators had seized First Republic, before selling its assets to JPMorgan Chase to fight off another global banking crisis. First Republic is the third US bank to collapse in just two months, after Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank folded earlier this year. All in all, there's a bit on — pour yourself a coffee and let's see where the day takes us."

Let's get the elephant in the room out of the way first: it's rates day. The RBA is meeting today to decide what to do with the cash rate, after leaving rates on hold at 3.6% in April. But we know that was a lineball call — in the meeting minutes published a couple of weeks later, the RBA board had considered another rise of 0.25 percentage points. So what could today's decision look like? Major banks and investors are widely predicting the RBA will leave the cash rate unchanged at 3.6%, with data last week showing inflation is slowly coming down. I'll bring you the latest on that decision when it happens at 2:30pm AEST, and all the reaction that follows. On the markets front, the Australian share market is looking to open lower this morning after ASX futures were down -0.7% to 7,336 points as of 7:30am. It follows a mixed performance on Wall Street overnight, with US financial markets largely dominated by the news that regulators had seized First Republic, before selling its assets to JPMorgan Chase to fight off another global banking crisis. First Republic is the third US bank to collapse in just two months, after Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank folded earlier this year. All in all, there's a bit on — pour yourself a coffee and let's see where the day takes us.",

Let's get the elephant in the room out of the way first: it's rates day. The RBA is meeting today to decide what to do with the cash rate, after leaving rates on hold at 3.6% in April. But we know that was a lineball call — in the meeting minutes published a couple of weeks later, the RBA board had considered another rise of 0.25 percentage points. So what could today's decision look like? Major banks and investors are widely predicting the RBA will leave the cash rate unchanged at 3.6%, with data last week showing inflation is slowly coming down. I'll bring you the latest on that decision when it happens at 2:30pm AEST, and all the reaction that follows. On the markets front, the Australian share market is looking to open lower this morning after ASX futures were down -0.7% to 7,336 points as of 7:30am. It follows a mixed performance on Wall Street overnight, with US financial markets largely dominated by the news that regulators had seized First Republic, before selling its assets to JPMorgan Chase to fight off another global banking crisis. First Republic is the third US bank to collapse in just two months, after Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank folded earlier this year. All in all, there's a bit on — pour yourself a coffee and let's see where the day takes us.",
