When he heard there had been a serious incident near the border with Gaza on October 7, he immediately jumped in his truck. He didn’t know what he was driving into when he headed down to southern Israel. Within hours of arriving, his truck was full with dozens of dead people who had been murdered by Hamas terrorists. Since then, he’s spent nearly every day collecting and transporting hundreds of bodies for identification and burial. He recounts one horrific story: “I walked into the house and there was a birthday cake sitting [there] … and you look up to the [photo on the] fridge and think, 'who had a birthday that day?'” he said. “We walk into the bedroom … and we see a family of five members, in a circle hugging each other. “You can’t believe what your eyes [have] seen, you cannot understand the situation. “One second there was a party and the next, death in the worst way you can think of.” Mr Greiniman said his team was still going through Kibbutzim near the border, searching for bodies and remains of people who had been killed.",

An unknown number of Australians stuck in the besieged territory have been told that their names are \"on the initial list of approved Australians\" to cross into Egypt. The ABC has seen an email sent by Australian consular officials which says the border may open to some Australians at 9am local time (6pm AEDT) on Wednesday. The email urges recipients to \"seize this opportunity to depart Gaza\" if they \"deem it safe to do so\". Recipients have also been told to take enough food and water to last for at least five hours and expect large crowds. There are 88 Australian citizens, residents, and their families known to be in Gaza. International media have reported that Egypt is set to allow 400 foreign nationals to leave Gaza through its border after a deal was struck with the United States and Israel.",
