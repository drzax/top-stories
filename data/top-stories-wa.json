She hasn't yet been tested alongside the Matildas' newest member, Clare Hunt, so Gustavsson is using this France game to see what the pair look like side-by-side at the heart of defence. Aside from them, it's a starting squad that we largely expected. France have also selected quite a strong line-up based on the players available, though the right side of their defence is lacking in major tournament experience. That's potentially a space for the zippy Cortnee Vine or the in-form Caitlin Foord to exploit. But Australia will have to keep their wits about them to deal with the veteran strike Eugenie Le Sommer, France's current leading goal-scorer, as well as the sensational PSG winger Kadidiatou Diani, who was lethal for the side following an ACL to club team-mate Marie-Antoinette Katoto.

They are missing three of their most valuable players in striker Marie-Antoinette Katoto, Amandine Henry, and Delphine Cascarino, all of whom withdrew due to injury. They also had to navigate a pretty tumultuous time earlier this year when a number of players, including captain Wendie Renard, temporarily boycotted the team due to ongoing disputes with former head coach Corinne Diacre. (Spain and Canada have been dealing with variations on the same theme, which you can read more about below). But the French Federation were the first to break, sacking Diacre in March and installing Herve Renard, a former player who also coached Saudi Arabia, Morocco, Ivory Coast, and Zambia on the men's side. Renard has no experience coaching women's football, though, so there are some questions about whether his appointment is too-little, too-late for a team that has chronically under-performed at international level given the quality of the players in the fold. But France do come into tonight's game with some wind in their sails: they defeated the Republic of Ireland 3-0 in a recent friendly, having also defeated Colombia and Canada in the April window. So this final friendly will be an important testing-ground for both France and Australia to see just how far they've come in the past six months, and what we can potentially expect from each nation in less than a week's time. Which players do you think pose the biggest danger for the Aussies tonight, team? I'm a Wendie Renard stan (tall gal appreciation!) so if she scores a towering header from a corner, please forgive the squeals you hear coming from the Marvel Stadium media box...",
