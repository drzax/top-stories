All sectors — minus energy — finished higher for the day, with industrials leading the charge, up 7.4%. Real estate (+2.1%), academic and educational services (+2%), healthcare (+1.6%), consumer cyclicals (+1.4%) and financials (+1.3%) recorded the biggest gains. More modest gains were recorded for technology stocks (+0.8%), basic materials (+0.7%), consumer non-cyclicals (+0.3%) and utilities (+0.3%). Energy was the only sector in the red, falling by a 0.1%. Block was far and away the best performer, after Afterpay's parent company lifted its earnings projections, while Treasury Wine tumbled after a round of discounted capital raising to fund its acquisition of DAOU Vineyards in California. The top performers for the day: Block +25.2% Weebit Nano +12.1% Sayona Mining +9% Neuren Pharmaceuticals +8.5% Core Lithium +8.5% At the other end, the worst performers were: Treasury Wine -7.8% Gold Road Resources -2.4% Bellevue Gold -2.2% Whitehaven Coal -1.9% Paladin Energy -1.5%",

It would be the first time the RBA would increase the cash rate since in four months, and all of the big four banks are expecting a 0.25 percentage point increase, which would take the cash rate to 4.35% — the highest rate since November 2011. Scott Solomon, a co-portfolio manager at T. Rowe Price says it's not necessarily an obvious decision that the RBA would lift rates, given the messaging by other central banks around the world. \" The decision is not an obvious one as most other central banks around the world have indicated they are likely done hiking,\" he said. \"However, given a recent strong inflation print, the minutes of the prior meeting showing a surprising balance between a hike and a no hike decision. In addition, the recent easing of financial conditions post the Fed's dovish pause, the calculus is tipped in favour of a hike. \" But Mr Solomon says the RBA could surprise us with a smaller hike of 0.15 percentage points — although he conceded it was \"unlikely\" to happen. \"Governor Bullock will likely try to pitch the decision as largely precautionary in nature,\" he said. \"In fact, I think it would be a nice opportunity to hike 15 [basis points] and bring the terminal rate to a more traditional 4.25%. \" It is unlikely they do that – but the RBA is no stranger to surprises and would check a lot of boxes.\" All will be revealed next Tuesday at 2:30pm AEDT.",

One citizen and one permanent resident were able to exit through the Rafah crossing out of Gaza during the second window for foreign nationals to evacuate on Thursday. The Australians, who were on a list to get out of Gaza in the first opportunity on Wednesday, made the crossing into Egypt with the help of consular officials from the UK. They will join the rest of the other 23 Australians who got out of Gaza safely on Wednesday for onward travel to Cairo. \"We continue to engage closely with partners in the region and do all we can to enable the remaining Australians in Gaza, who wish to leave, to do so as soon as possible,\" a foreign affairs department spokesman said. \"The timing of those departures depends on a range of factors. \"The situation in Gaza continues to be highly challenging and can change rapidly.\" More than 800 people have been able to leave Gaza via the Rafah crossing under a deal brokered between the US, Egypt, Israel and Qatar. A third crossing opportunity is expected to take place on Friday. Reporting with AAP",
