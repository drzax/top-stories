Both former Socceroos managers were guests of Graham Arnold in camp this week, delivering some powerful messages to the squad - and also to Australian football. Postecoglou was asked this week about the impact of the Women's World Cup on the domestic game, and whether the incredible success of that tournament would kick-start football in Australia. Having bemoaned our country's lack of structure, investment, and cultural support for the game in the past, he reiterated those comments this week, saying Australia will probably never become the kind of footballing nation that we believe we can be. “When you look at what the Matildas did at the World Cup: unbelievable,” he said. “But you still won’t see an influx of resources to the game. You won’t, I guarantee it. “I just don’t think the nation as a whole has that inside them to understand you can make an impact on the world of football, but it requires a kind of nationalistic approach that I just don’t think Australians at their core are really interested in.\" What did you make of Ange's comments? I personally don't think they're very helpful at a time when we're trying to build public support and belief in the sport, but do you think he's right?",
