The Magpies have won the grand final by just four points, breaking Lions hearts but treating us all to football of the absolute highest quality. Goals to Jordan De Goey and Steele Sidebottom kicked the big goals in the last quarter to set up the win, but that late major from Joe Daniher set up the most breathless of finishes. But the Pies held on. They always do! This is a special team that simply wins these games. And now they have a premiership to show for it.",
