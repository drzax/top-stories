              "plaintext": "Senior government ministers are dismissing growing pressure to review the decision to ban extra Qatar Airways flights into Australia. The federal government quashed a request from the airline to allow additional flights per week into Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane. Acting Queensland Labor Premier Steven Miles says additional flights would push prices down — and he would have approved the request if it was up to state governments. But Employment Minister Tony Burke insists there is no need for a review. \"The decision [has] been made by Minister (Catherine) King, based on the national interest, that decision, I have got no reason to question that at all,\" he said. Meanwhile, Nationals senator Bridget McKenzie wants to launch a Senate inquiry into the government's decision. Senator McKenzie says after not getting answers from the transport minister, she will today call for a Senate inquiry on the issue — also accusing the government of being too cosy with Qantas. \"In the absence of her answering the questions and coming clean, it's very easy to assume that this government is continuing to run a protection racket for the most complained about company in our country, when you look at the ACCC figures,\" she said.",

              "plaintext": "New industrial relations legislation will be introduced to parliament today, which the government says will close loopholes that currently lead to unfair pay and conditions. Political reporter Evelyn Manfield explains what's being debated: This is the second tranche of the government's industrial relations reform. Under the change, the Fair Work Act would be amended to close a so-called loophole where an employer and employees have agreed through an enterprise agreement to a particular rate of pay, but then that pay is undercut when the employer brings in different workers through labour hire. The bill is also promising to introduce greater protections for gig economy workers and casuals, and increase penalties for wage theft. But business groups are opposing the changes, arguing they add complexity and will drive up costs. Political reporter Stephanie Borys was on News Breakfast earlier and said the bill will be debated for four weeks in the House of Representatives before it goes to the Senate where the government needs to find the numbers from the Greens and crossbench to get it through.",

The application was made to the country's gambling commission to suspend the unit's casino operator's license for a period \"in the range of 10 days\", following a complaint made early last year by a former customer who gambled at the SkyCity Auckland casino from August 2017 to February 2021, SkyCity said. \"The Secretary (of the DIA) states in the application that SCML did not comply with requirements in its SkyCity Auckland Host Responsibility Programme relating to detection of incidences of continuous play by the customer,\" SkyCity said in a statement. SkyCity Casino Management is the holder of the company's casino operator's license for its casinos in the Auckland, Hamilton and Queenstown regions in New Zealand. The company did not comment further, adding that it would fully comply with the DIA secretary in relation to the application and process. Last year, Australia's financial crime regulator launched civil proceedings against the operator's casino in Adelaide to crack down on the gambling industry. By 11:08am AEST, its shares were down 14.6 per cent to $1.99.",
