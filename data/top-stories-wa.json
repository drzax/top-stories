That translates to more interest rate rises being likely in the coming months, with many analysts expecting there are at least two more rate rises to come before the RBA is finished with its current rate hiking cycle. Here's more of that statement from RBA governor Philip Lowe : \"Some further tightening of monetary policy may be required to ensure that inflation returns to target in a reasonable timeframe, but that will depend upon how the economy and inflation evolve. \"The decision to hold interest rates steady this month provides the Board with more time to assess the state of the economy and the economic outlook and associated risks. \"In making its decisions, the Board will continue to pay close attention to developments in the global economy, trends in household spending, and the forecasts for inflation and the labour market. \"The Board remains resolute in its determination to return inflation to target and will do what is necessary to achieve that.\"",

They need to walk to keep fitness and joint movement, but we don't want to force them. What should we do? Dr Karishma 's advice: Osteoarthritis is such a common ailment affecting many of our senior pets. Whilst it is true that we should still provide gentle exercise and enrichment to our geriatric pets, it is important not to over-do it or push them beyond their limits as this can hinder them more than help them. If you find that your dog's can only walk halfway around the block, then reduce their walks to this distance. This is their way of telling you that they are not physically capable of walking further than this without being in discomfort or pain. And as they continue to age, you will likely find that the length of these walks will reduce even further. A good alternative to walking outside if they are having trouble is spending more time in the garden with them so they still get the interaction and fresh air without pushing themselves. Another good alternative is swimming or hydrotherapy for our senior pets who enjoy the water, to keep their joints moving - although this is not for everyone! And finally getting them checked out at the vet is a great idea to get them on an osteoarthritis management plan and provide pain relief where needed. And if they are not at the stage of needing pain management, there are some fantastic natural injections and oral supplements these days that can greatly improve their quality of life and get them moving more freely again.",

She is well trained, has no notable history of abuse and has been a delight to welcome into our home. Thanks Stephen and Heidi for you questions! I've put this to both Dr Karishma and Laura V. Dr Karishma: Breaking habits, especially ones that are intermittent can be a challenging and lengthy process. The first step is trying to identify the trigger for this behaviour. Some common reasons include territorial spraying if they are not desexed, from urinary incontinence, old age, osteoarthritis, dementia, stress/fear/anxiety - even to noise outside, kidney disease, diabetes, cushing's disease, or urinary tract infections/stones in the bladder. It's important to get your pet checked at the vet to identify any of these underlying issues. Once a trigger has been identified, it usually will make things easier to treat, especially if there is an underlying medical issue. If these things have been ruled out, then re-training your dog may include things like increasing toilet breaks - especially after sleep and rewarding them for peeing in appropriate places. As well as ensuring area's where they have previously urinated are thoroughly cleaned with an enzymatic cleaner that eliminates the smell so they can't recognoise that smell.And considering pheromone collars and diffuser's in the house to help they feel comfortable in their environment if they are an anxious dog. And here's Laura V's take: Laura V: Dogs will wee inside the house for a number of reasons - they have not been trained properly to go outdoors, or they have an underlying anxiety, or they have an underlying medical problem. If it is occasional, try to identify the pattern. If you can predict it, then you can prevent it, by calling your dog outside to the toilet. Putting your dog on a lead can also help as you can manage their behaviour more consistently, preventing them from sneaking away to wee in another room. There is always the possibility that your dog has an underlying infection or disease that needs to be addressed by your vet, so a check up is well worth it. Punishing dogs for having accidents inside only makes them more anxious and can make them more likely to sneak away in another room when you're not looking.",

I’ve had his mouth checked at the vet. What is causing this? Thanks for reaching out with that one Stephen. I've put it to Dr Karishma who says : Dr Karishma: Sometimes dog's can teeth grind just like in people! I usually will do a full oral examination to check for any dental disease, tooth root abscesses, foreign bodies, masses/cancers or swellings in the mouth that can contribute to abnormal chewing. As well as checking the jaw for any pain, malocculusions, abnormal jaw alignment or resistance when opening/closing the jaw. I will usually follow this up with imaging of the jaw and teeth to ensure there are no lesions to the jaw or teeth that can not be seen from visual inspection alone - especially below the gum line. If this is all clear, and he is not showing any signs of pain, likely it's a behavioural displacement behaviour secondary to stress, fear or anxiety. Or even a learnt comfort behaviour, especially if it dissipates in the evenings when he is likely feeling very comfortable and getting into bed. Some dog's will actually suck on a blanket or hold items in their mouth too as a form of comfort.",
