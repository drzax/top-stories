Let's start with new capital expenditure figures (or capex figures if you're in the know). The ABS says that in the March 2023 quarter, private new capital expenditure rose by 2.4% — and was 6.3% higher than it was 12 months ago. “Today’s new capital expenditure publication covers business investments in new equipment, machinery, buildings and structures, and gives us important insights into Australian business’ future investment plans,\" said Ben Dorber, head of new capital expenditure statistics at the ABS. \"For example, we saw this quarter that capex rose for mining and non-mining industries, as businesses increased investment in new equipment and machinery by 3.7% and building and structures by 1.3%. \"The 3.7% rise in new equipment and machinery was the largest quarterly rise since the March quarter in 2021.\" He said most industries have been a rise in equipment capex spending, while a 23.1% fall in construction was partly offset by strong results elsewhere. \"The fall in construction businesses investing in new equipment and machinery follows a period of high investment in recent years and may demonstrate some of the impact from continued falls in building approvals,\" Mr Dorber said. \"Construction businesses expectations for future investment, however, remain positive.\"",
