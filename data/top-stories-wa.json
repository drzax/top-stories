The ASX 200 closed down by 0.9 per cent. But looking around the region, other markets fared even worse— Tokyo's Nikkei closed more than 1 per cent lower while stocks in Hong Kong are down more than 2 per cent. Locally, it was the mining stocks that really weighed on the market. At some points the afternoon, the ASX 300 Metals & Mining index was down as much as 2 per cent, to its lowest in more than a month. Worries around the health of China's economy, particularly the property sector, a key source of demand for Australian resources, fueled the selling. Traders are awaiting retail sales and industrial production data out of China tomorrow, with concerns it could disappoint, while property developer Country Garden suspended trading in its onshore bonds. On the local share market, 154 of the top 200 stocks ended in the red, with only two sectors posting modest gains — technology and energy. Financials were hit hard, with Bendigo and Adelaide Bank shares dropping 2.9 per cent after its profit result didn't receive a good reception. Here are the biggest individual stock moves on the benchmark index this session: Bottom 5 Syrah Resources (-6.9%) Elders (-6.1%) Pilbara Minerals (-6%) Allkem (-3.9%) Sayona Mining (-3.7%) Top 5 Lake Resources (+7.7%) Carsales (+7%) Sims (+4%) Imugene (+3.4%) Life360 (+3%) The Australian dollar has also lost ground, trading below 64.8 US cents.",

The bank's preferred measure of cash profit — which excludes one-offs such as a software writedown and restructuring costs — was up a healthier 15.3% to $576.9 million. Like its big four rivals, Bendigo and Adelaide enjoyed a healthy increase in its net interest margin (NIM) — the gap between what the bank pays to borrow money and the rates it lends it out at. Its NIM rose 0.2 of a percentage point to 1.94%, which was still lagging larger rivals such as CBA, which last week reported a 0.17 percentage point increase in NIM to 2.07%. Unlike CBA, which reported a decrease in NIM over the second half, Bendigo and Adelaide said it has increase its NIM to 1.98% over that period amid reduced competition in the home loan market, resulting in smaller customer discounts. The bank boasted an increase of 0.9 of a percentage point on its return on equity (ROE), a key measure of profitability, to 8.62%. This compares to an ROE for the Commonwealth Bank of around 14% last financial year. The bank said it is \"not seeing material signs of borrower distress\" and there was a reduction in bad debts over the latest half year to June 30.",

Shares of Country Garden shed more than 15% to HK$0.83 in morning trading, dragging down the Hang Seng Mainland Properties Index, which dropped 4.6%. The stock has lost nearly 50% so far this month. Country Garden's offshore bonds also eased, with a few trading at the lower end of 6 cents on the dollar. Its January 2031 bond traded at 6.071 cents as at 0228 GMT, according to data by Duration Finance. In separate filings during the weekend, the firm said it would suspend trading in 11 of its onshore bonds from Monday, and their resumption of trading would be determined at a later date. The move followed reports on Friday that the company was heading for a debt restructuring, after it missed payments of two dollar bond coupons due on Aug. 6 totalling $22.5 million. Six cents in the dollar on a bond implies an extremely low degree of confidence that investors will get anything back on their loans to Country Garden. Definitely one to watch, along with Evergrande and a raft of other Chinese developers that are in deep financial bother.",
