The artist who brought painting to the people, with works completed for TV viewers in less than 30 minutes with little more than a bristle brush and palette knife, certainly wouldn't have envisioned one of his works going up for sale for nearly $US10 million ($A16 million). But that's the price a Minneapolis gallery in the US is asking for A Walk In The Woods — the first of more than 400 paintings Ross produced on-air for his PBS series The Joy Of Painting. \"It is season one, episode one of what you would call the rookie card for Bob Ross,\" Ryan Nelson, who owns the gallery, Modern Artifact, said of the work created in the show's debut in 1983. He says he doesn't expect a quick sale given the high asking price, which he sees as an opportunity to display the painting for a larger audience. \"What this piece represents is the people's artist,\" Mr Nelson says. \"This isn't an institution that's telling you that Bob Ross is great. It's not some high-brow gallery telling you that Bob Ross is great. This is the masses, the population in the world that are saying that Bob Ross is great.\" On that first show, Ross — sporting his beloved perm, full beard and unbuttoned shirt — stressed that painting didn't need to be pretentious: Ross, who died in 1995, hosted the show until 1994.",
