Hundreds gathered at the Caulfield Shule for the community event, including independent MP Zoe Daniel and former federal treasurer Josh Frydenberg. Richard Marles told the crowd Australia's 'heart breaks' for Israel, and reiterated his government's condemnation of Hamas. And he said Australia would stand with Israel as it responds to the terror attacks. \"In 2023, it is time around the world that there is an acknowledgement that Israel has the right to exist in peace, and in security,\" he said. \"And as this right is asserted, our nation stands as one with all the people of Israel.\" Senator Paterson said the Liberal Party would hold steadfast with Israel, even if global support for Israel's actions in response to the attacks starts to waver. \"Friends, sadly we know that in the coming days and weeks, the outpouring of goodwill and sympathy and support that we've seen around the world will be tested,\" he said. \"Because Israel cannot live any longer with the existential risk of an event like this occurring again. The response must be decisive. \"And when that time comes, we will stand with you through what needs to be done. We are not fairweather friends.\"",
