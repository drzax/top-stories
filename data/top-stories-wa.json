This was despite the company revealing its fourth-quarter revenue plunged 47% (as it was hurt by lower market prices for rare earth products during the quarter). The world's largest producer of rare earths outside of China said sales revenue was $157.5 million for the three months ended June 30 (compared with $294.5 million a year ago). On the other hand, shares of IGO fell 4.1% despite the lithium miner reporting a small increase in its June quarter sales revenue, compared to the same period last year. However, the worst performer was Silver Lake Resources. The gold miner's share price plunged 23.1% after it released quarterly results which fell below market expectations.",

In economic news, the key event is tomorrow's Reserve Bank board meeting. Markets are betting the likelihood of of an interest rate hike is around 20%, according to Refinitiv data.
