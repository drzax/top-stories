The pair met briefly during last November's G20 summit in Bali, and there is growing speculation Albanese could make his first visit to China as leader before the end of the year. When asked about Beijing's recent decision to lift tariffs on barley, the prime minister has told parliament his government is always open to dialogue with Australia's largest trading partner. \"I met with Xi Jinping in November last year, and I'm sure that we will potentially meet again on the sidelines of the G20 meeting that will be coming up in the future,\" Albanese said.",
