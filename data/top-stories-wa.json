                "plaintext": "The little girl was weeping in pain and screaming \"Mummy, Mummy\" while the nurse stitched up her head wound without using any anaesthetic because none was available at the time at Al Shifa Hospital in Gaza City. That was one of the worst moments nurse Abu Emad Hassanein could recall as he described the struggle to deal with an unprecedented influx of wounded people and a dearth of pain relief medication since the war in Gaza started a month ago. \"Sometimes we give some of them sterile gauze (to bite on) to reduce the pain,\" said Hassanein. \"We know that the pain they feel is more than someone would imagine, beyond what someone their age would stand,\" he said, referring to children like the girl with the head wound. Arriving at Al Shifa to have the dressing changed and disinfectant applied to an injury on his back caused by an Israeli air strike, Nemer Abu Thair, a middle-aged man, said that he was given no pain relief when the wound was originally stitched up. \"I kept reciting the Koran until they finished,\" he said. Mohammad Abu Selmeyah, the director of Al Shifa Hospital, said that when very large numbers of injured people have been brought in at the same time, there has been no choice but to deal with them on the floor, without adequate pain relief. Procedures that have been performed by staff at Al Shifa under such circumstances have included amputating limbs and fingers, stitching up serious wounds, and treating serious burns, said Abu Selmeyah, without elaborating.
