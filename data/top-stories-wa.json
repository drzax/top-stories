              "plaintext": "Next up in our look at the top draft prospects of 2023 is Colby McKercher, our Tasmanian midfield dynamo. As a pure midfielder, there is no better option in this year's draft. McKercher is a prolific ball winner both inside the contest and as an outside receiver, and has uses it well with his tidy left foot. But where McKercher really stands out is his speed and agility. Combine that with his willingness to take defenders on and find creative solutions on the field and you're looking at a midfielder with real hurt factor. Think of a Errol Gulden or Connor Rozee type, the sort of player that can impact at the stoppage but push forward for a goal or two a game. McKercher is fun to watch, because he'll very rarely take the boring and safe option. There has been some talk that teams might be a little put off by the Tasmania of it all, but McKercher has been at pains all year to stress he is keen to head to the mainland and is determined to be a one-club player wherever he ends up. McKercher is a top-three prospect and there is no way he'll slip out of the top five.",

That will be a matter for the committee,\" Albanese told the ABC. \"What I'm focused on is the outcome on Saturday, and then I will focus on getting it done, getting the Voice put in place and it will be a very positive uplifting moment. \" I see this as being just like the apology to the Stolen Generation. There was a lot of concern, and, frankly, fake news about what the consequences of it would be. There would be all these negative consequences. None of them were realised. \"We know that it was an uplifting moment, particularly, I think, for young Australians at that time. Every school in the whole country stopped to hear the apology. \"Brendan Nelson gave a fine speech as Liberal leader. It is unfortunate that Peter Dutton walked out on that speech. He found the consequences he was talking about, though, weren't realised. He has apologised for that but is committing exactly the same actions in being negative, saying No on this.\"",

It compares to a loss of $565.5 million in 2022. Revenue more than doubled to $5 billion, after a strong increase in customer demand for travel, despite cost of living pressure. CEO Jayne Hrdlicka says it is 'an important milestone' for the airline. \"By creating a systemically lower cost base and a conservative balance sheet as well as investing heavily in technology and our frontline, we are well positioned for the future,\" she said. Virgin Australia was purchased in 2020 for $3.5 billion by US private equity firm Bain Capital, after the airline was placed into voluntary administration. \"Our balance sheet is now considerably stronger and the cost base of the business has significantly improved from recent years,\" said Virgin's CFO Race Strauss. Earlier this year Bain Capital confirmed it is looking to relist Virgin Australia on the Australian Securities Exchange at some stage.",
