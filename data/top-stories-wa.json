While attending an event held by Spain's central bank, he said the Fed expects \"the moderate pace of interest rate decisions to continue\" after a pause earlier this month. Before pausing, the Fed had hiked rates in 10 straight meetings, leaving the rate between 5-5.25% range — which it said would give them time to assess the lag of rate hikes and manage the aftershocks of the US bank stresses. But the US labour market remains tight at 3.7% and inflation remains a big concern for the Fed, even though it's down from its peak. \"Inflation pressures continue to run high, and the process of getting inflation back down to 2 percent has a long way to go,\" Powell told the event in Madrid. He also said he wasn't alone in his thinking — he told the event a \"strong majority\" of policymakers at the Fed think there's at least two more rate rises coming by the year's end. There's only four more policy meetings this year, with the next one at the end of July. The Fed's inflation target is 2%, with US inflation double that at 4.1% in May.",
