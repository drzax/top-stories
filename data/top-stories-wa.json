Kim reportedly spent two days in the city, visiting a university, an aquarium and an animal food plant, among other facilities. It wrapped up his unusually lengthy, week-long trip to Russia, during which he pledged to step up military and economic cooperation with President Vladimir Putin. The visit will serve as \"an opportunity to further solidify the traditional bond of good-neighbourhood cooperation between the two countries, which are rooted in comradely friendship and military unity, and to open a new chapter in the development of relations,\" KCNA said. The rare summit between Kim and Putin has prompted the United States and South Korea to warn against any weapons trade.

Members of the Last Generation group used fire extinguishers filled with paint to spray all six columns of the popular landmark. \"The protest makes it clear: It is time for a political change,\" the group said in a statement. \"Away from fossil fuels — towards fairness.\" Police cordoned off the area surrounding the gate, and confirmed they had detained 14 activists affiliated with the Last Generation. Berlin Mayor Kai Wegner has condemned the group's actions. \"With these actions, this group is not only damaging the historic Brandenburg Gate, but also our free discourse about the important issues of our time and future,\" he told a German news agency. The actions came at the same time that thousands marched to kick off New York Climate Week .",

The CCI class action related to consumer credit insurance for credit cards and personal loans sold between January 1, 2010 and March 7, 2018. According to Slater and Gordon, which was behind the class action, claimed CBA: caused customers to make payments as a result of a mis,taken belief their policy was compulsory or provided value to them engaged in misleading or deceptive conduct in relation to the sale of the policies to customers, engaged in unconscionable conduct in relation to the sale and issue of the policies to customers by, among other things, selling or issuing policies with no or little value, unlawfully provided personal advice to some customers who purchased the policies in a bank branch or over the telephone.",

As for how the RBA will see its new dawn, it'll be a pretty muted affair. We're still two weeks away from the RBA's next meeting on interest rates (October 3, if you haven't got it in the diary). But the RBA will release the minutes from its most recent meeting earlier this month, when the central bank barely shifted the dial from its monetary policy stance in its August meeting.

              "plaintext": "Good morning and welcome to Monday, September 18 — it's a new week, and you're reading the ABC's business and markets blog, and it's great to have your company. Let's start with where the overseas markets finished the week. In the US, Wall Street fell on Friday as investors bided their time ahead of the Federal Reserve's latest interest rates meeting coming up this week (that's happening late on Wednesday, Australian time). The Dow was 0.8% lower on Friday, the S & P500 fell by 1.2%, and the Nasdaq slipped by 1.6%. Meanwhile European stocks had their strongest day in six months, as the European Central Bank signalled an end to rate hikes was edging closer. The pan-European Stoxx600 rose 1.5%, buoyed by the ECB's decision and stronger commodity prices. It's not just the Fed who will have interest rate decisions this week — investors are also keenly watching for the B ank of England's rate decision on Thursday, and the Bank of Japan's decision on Friday. As for what it means back home? The ASX is in for a weaker start, with futures trending down this morning. That said, commodities businesses are set to do well, with the price of Brent crude reaching a 10-month high, while iron ore futures at at a six-month high.
