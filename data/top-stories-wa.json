Philip Lowe was asked about whether an increase in the unemployment rate was still likely, given inflation was coming down now and the RBA is so focused on preserving the gains in the labour market. Incoming RBA governor Michele Bullock has been criticised for saying unemployment could hit 4.5% earlier this year. Philip Lowe said even though the unemployment rate was holding steady at 3.5%, it was still the central bank's view that unemployment would have to tick up slightly. \"We're now moving into the next phase of getting inflation down [and] it will involve slower growth in unit labour costs,\" he said. \"Mean unit labour costs at the moment are increasing very rapidly. That's the difference between nominal wage growth and productivity. \"Our sense is that for inflation to come back to 2 to 3%, then we're going to have to see some moderation in growth in unit labour costs, and that's why the pick-up in productivity is so important, and we're also expecting after wage growth picks up a bit more then there'll be some moderation in growth in wages. \"We're hoping that the rise in unemployment will be modest but to get services price inflation back to a more sustainable rate. \"Our judgment is that that's likely to be accompanied with some modest rise in unemployment.\"",

The main drag was energy, which gave up some of yesterday's huge gains with a 1 per cent decline early on. Mining stocks were also in the red, with BHP down 0.5%, while Rio Tinto and Fortescue were both off a tad over 1%. The banking sector was generally lifting the market, with Westpac's 0.5% rise the best of the big four, and only NAB flat to slightly lower. AMP was backing up yesterday's strong gains with another 3.7% rise to $1.1925, after a well-received result released yesterday. Consumer cyclicals were up, with embattled casino operator Star surging nearly 19% to $1.1575.",
