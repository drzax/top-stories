CBA's Kristina Clifton writes: \"At the previous meeting in June the BoE stepped up the pace of tightening again and hiked by 50bp after 25bp hikes at the March and May meetings. The larger 50bp hike in June was triggered by stronger than expected labour earnings and CPI data released in the lead up to the meeting. The latest CPI data showed a slight deceleration in core and services inflation in June. However growth in labour earnings has lifted further. With inflation and earnings not yet having convincingly turned around we favour a 50bp increase at today's meeting. A 50bp hike would take the bank rate to 5.50%, in line with the US FOMC and RBNZ. Thereafter we expect one last 25bp hike in September taking the bank rate to 5.75%.\"",

This from Westpac's senior economist Matthew Hassan, who titled it, \"Three quarters of decline — about as bad as it gets for retail\". \"Putting this into historical context: the retail estimates, which go back to 1983, only show one other occasion when real retail sales recorded three consecutive quarterly declines – around the interest rate peak just prior to the GFC. \"Moreover, the 1.7% cumulative decline over the last three quarters is the biggest nine-month fall outside of COVID disruptions, with the 3.5% fall in per capita sales even topping the contraction seen during the initial COVID lock-down in 2020 (but short of the 4.1% drop recorded over nine months when the 'delta' lockdown hit in 2021).\" The retail sector enjoyed a post-lockdown boom, but the good times are well and truly over on the back of 4 percentage points of rate increases in the space of just over a year.",
