But he has done enormous damage to the democratic world and, in particular, to the United States. \"The anger-tainment ecosystem that Fox News, above all, has created in the US has left America angrier and more divided than it's been at any time since the civil war. It is sought in order to keep its ratings up, it is sought to enrage Americans, divide Americans, and divide them against each other.\" Mr Turnbull says he doesn't believe much will change under the helm of the media mogul's son, Lachlan Murdoch. \"Knowing both of them over a very long period of time, my impression is that Lachlan is more ideologically conservative than Rupert. \"I think Rupert has always been fascinated by power — he's drawn to it like a moth is to a flame — and so he's enjoyed exerting the power that he has over the political system. And Rupert's politics have evolved to be broadly right-wing, I would say. \"But, I agree, I think Lachlan is, if anything, more ideological than his father.

US markets all took losses overnight. The Dow Jones lost a touch over 1%, the Nasdaq lost 1.8%, and the S & P500 lost 1.6%. And if we look at the global stock market indices, the board is a sea of red, as they say, except for the volatility index (which is up 15%). So we'll see what happens locally today. Remember, yesterday Australia's market closed down by 1.4%, at 7,065.2 points, which was the lowest level since July 11. Rupert Murdoch has announced he is stepping down as chairman of Fox Corp and News Corp, and handing the reins to his son Lachlan. There'll be a lot of news on that topic today.",
