This is not something that we normally expect to happen in Wellington. \"I was just at the emergency centre we've set up. There's a lot of people there who just escaped pretty much in their pyjamas and bare feet into a very cold night. \"We're basically having to go and find clothing for a whole bunch of people who have potentially lost everything.\"",

The Loafers Lodge hostel has a capacity for 92 guests, but it's unclear how many people were inside at the time of the fire, at around 12:30am local time. Police say their initial assessment \"is that the number of deceased is fewer than 10\". They say they are waiting to access and assess the building to confirm details. \"It is currently unsafe and until we can access the building — and reconcile numbers of people who are safe — we are not in a position to determine how many people are deceased or unaccounted for,\" police say. \"Our focus is on identifying those people as soon as we can.\"",
