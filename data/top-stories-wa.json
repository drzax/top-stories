But if you dive into the bureau's excel spreadsheets, you find the quarterly picture is quite different. Goods prices (+0.9%) actually increased by more in the June quarter compared to March than services prices (+0.8%). Moreover, the quarterly increase in services prices was the lowest in a year, falling dramatically from a peak of 2.1% in December — when travel providers jacked up prices for summer holidays. The main reason the annual reading is so high is that lower figures from the COVID period have now all dropped out of the annual data, which is dragged up by big services prices rises in the September (+1.6%), December (+2.1%) and March (+1.7%) quarters. The rise of 0.8% in the three months to June is less than half that seen in the previous quarter so, on that basis, services inflation is actually decelerating rather sharply. It must be noted, though, that these quarterly figures are NOT seasonally adjusted, and a quick look back through recent data hints that June is probably the weakest quarter for services price rises on average.",
