With only a few hours of trade left, it's looking increasingly likely the local share market will finish roughly where it started this week. A continued slide in tech stocks is a big driver behind the ASX's dip, with the technology sector down 1.1%, and the academic and educational, industrials and financial sectors each down 0.7%. Consumer non-cyclicals are up 1.1% though, while energy has gained 0.6%. As for the top movers: Ingenia Communities +4.1% Coronado Global Resources: +2.8% Endeavour Group +2% Whitehaven Coal +1.95 Treasury Wine +1.8% At the other end, miners are among the worst performers: Mineral Resources -6.9% Lake Resources -5.5% Newcrest Mining -5.2% Syrah Resources -5.1% Imugene -5%",

The complaint filed in Delaware bankruptcy court also names as defendants Caroline Ellison, who led Bankman-Fried's Alameda Research hedge fund; former FTX technology chief Zixiao \"Gary\" Wang ; and former FTX engineering director Nishad Singh. FTX said the defendants continually misappropriated funds to finance luxury condominiums, political contributions, speculative investments and other \"pet projects\", while committing \"one of the largest financial frauds in history\". The alleged fraudulent transfers occurred between February 2020 and November 2022 when FTX filed for Chapter 11 protection, and could be undone â or \"avoided\" â under the US bankruptcy code or Delaware law, FTX said. A spokesman for Bankman-Fried declined a request for comment from Reuters. Bankman-Friend has pleaded not guilty to several criminal charges, while Ellison, Wang and Singh have pleaded guilty and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors.",
