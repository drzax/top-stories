The US market was shocked by a credit downgrade from one of the key ratings agencies - meaning it thinks the country is a bit riskier for investors than it was yesterday. That can trigger higher interest payments but the biggest blow is probably to confidence in the market. The ASX futures market is at 7,241 points, down 58 points or -0.8%.
