The RBA wants inflation to come down to 2 to 3 per cent. \"Yesterday’s decision to increase interest rates again was taken to provide greater confidence that inflation will return to target within a reasonable time frame,\" Mr Lowe said. \"It follows recent information that has suggested greater upside risks to the bank’s inflation outlook.\" \"Services price inflation is proving persistent here and overseas, and the recent data on inflation, wages and housing prices were higher than had been factored into the forecasts.\" \"Given this shift in risks and the already fairly drawn-out return of inflation to target, the board judged that a further increase in interest rates was warranted.\" Here's more from my colleague Michael Janda.",
