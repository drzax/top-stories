One person is dead in Mexico amid reports of flash flooding in the peninsula, where some roads were swept away and images on social media showed raging torrents gushing down city streets that have been turned into rivers. In the United States, the storm is already wreaking havoc on flights and sporting events before it's even arrived, and officials are warning residents to remain indoors and keep emergency supplies handy. Though Hilary has been weakening over the last 48 hours as it nears land, it is still set to be the wettest storm ever to hit the US Southwest, according to Zack Taylor, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service (NWS). \"This is a dangerous storm,\" he says. \"It's not just the rain totals but the intensity.\" Reuters is reporting that Hilary is set to dump vast amounts of water on many parts of the US Southwest that are more accustomed to dry conditions. Areas such as Palm Springs, California, which typically gets around 116 millimetres of rain in an entire year, could receive 152mm to 254mm from this one storm. California's Death Valley area, which receives only about 55 millimetres of rain per year, could receive 76-101 millimetres of rain from this event.",

The company, which is behind major brands including NRMA and CGU, said its profits had risen to $832 million for the 12 months to June 30, up from $347 million. The result included a turnaround from losses in investment markets one year ago, but inflation also increased motor and homes claims and IAG's natural perils allowance. This cut the insurer's underlying insurance margin from 14.6 per cent in 2021/22 to 12.6 per cent in 2022/23. \"FY23 was a solid year for IAG, reflecting the positive momentum in our core business and the significant progress we've made to create a stronger and more resilient company,\" said IAG managing director and chief executive Nick Hawkins. Mr Hawkins said 2022/23 was another year of significant perils, with devastating large-scale events across Australia and New Zealand. IAG has increased its 2023/24 natural perils allowance by 26 per cent to $1.147 billion. The company forecast its insurance margin would be between 13.5 per cent to 15.5 per cent. \"We are now moving to warmer and dryer conditions, which should see a shift away from rain-dominated claims,\" Mr Hawkins said. The company is paying a final dividend of 9 cents.",

In a market update on Monday, the nation's second-largest lender said competition in the home loan market had squeezed its core net interest margin (NIM), which is a measure of what the bank earns on loans less funding and other costs. It rose by 10 basis points during the three months ending June 30, to 2.06 per cent, compared to the 1.96 per cent margin in the first half. Expenses for the second half to date had grown by about 5 per cent, it said, driven by higher prices for suppliers and wages. The company's profit result was below forecasts of a result of about $1.9 billion that Citigroup analysts were expecting. Excluding treasury and markets income and hedging gains, NIM, a key measure of bank profitability, was 1.86 per cent, down 4 basis points from the first half, reflecting ongoing mortgage competition. Australian loans that were overdue by 90 days or more were 7 basis points higher at 0.80 per cent, while those in New Zealand were 3 basis points higher at 0.32 per cent.",
