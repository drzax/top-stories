However, the results were more than a third down on last year's profit of $811 million. Harvey Norman enjoyed strong sales and profits during the COVID-19 pandemic, with customers buying home furnishings and office supplies during lockdowns. But franchise and company-operated sales revenue was down this year as many Australians struggle with the rising cost of living. Chairman Gerry Harvey said the company has delivered 40% growth in net assets since the beginning of the pandemic. \"Our balance sheet remains strong with total assets of $7.67 billion, anchored by a $4 billion property portfolio.\" While the majority of its stores are in Australia, Harvey Norman has stores across 8 countries including New Zealand, Singapore and Ireland. The retailer plans to expand to 80 stores in Malaysia by the end of 2028, including a further 8 stores this year. The company will pay a final dividend of 12 cents per share, taking the full-year dividend to 25 cents per share, down from 37.5 cents last year.",
