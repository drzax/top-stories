The Gorgon and Wheatstone plants in the state's north have the capacity to separate supply and send it south to Perth and customers through the state, both residential and commercial. The workers have given an undertaking that through their protected industrial action they will continue to ensure LNG flows to domestic customers. You might recall, back in 2006 the then WA Premier, Alan Carpenter set up the gas reservation policy with the producers here in the state to ensure they committed 15 per cent of their production was reserved for Western Australian consumption. The WA government has so far stayed clear of weighing in on the Chevron worker dispute, saying it is for the Fair Work Commission to oversee. However, it has stated, should supply become constrained, it has levers it can pull to ensure households are not without energy. This dispute could have a way to run. Last year Shell workers walked off the job for 76 days, reportedly costing the company $1bn .",

Economist Adam Boyton says this is a more mixed labour force survey than the headline 64.9k gain in employment suggests. \"In particular, the unemployment rate holding at 3.7%, the vast bulk of jobs growth being part time, and hours worked falling in the month takes the gloss off the impressive headline jobs print. So despite the jump in headline employment we are left thinking the August labour force survey in its entirety isn't too different from our broad expectations. Yes, the labour market is still very solid but slack is creeping in (witness the increase in the underemployment rate to 6.6% in August from 6.4% in July).\" He note, in the past six months employment has risen by an average of 37.8k a month, that's well below the rate of population growth. Part-time employment increased 62.1k, while full-time rose 2.8k in the month. ANZ thinks the Reserve Bank won't change the cash rate \"for quite some time\".",
