Earlier today, APRA said it would impose a requirement on Medibank to set aside an extra $250 million in capital from July 1, in reponse to last year's hack which resulted in 9.7 million customer records being leaked to the dark web. The health insurer said it has \"sufficient existing capital\" to meet this additional burden. \"After application of this requirement Medibank will remain well capitalised with unallocated capital remaining at 30 June 2022 levels, which was $148 million,\" the company wrote in a statement. \"As a result of this Medibank will not currently reduce its target health insurance required capital ratio\". At least three separate class action lawsuits have been filed in Australian courts on behalf of affected customers against the company over the network intrusion.

APRA also said it will conduct a \"targeted technology review\" of the health insurer, focusing on its governance and risk culture. “In taking this action, APRA seeks to ensure that Medibank expedites its remediation program,” said APRA member Suzanne Smith. \"APRA expects Medibank to ensure there is appropriate accountability and consequence management, including impacts to executive remuneration where appropriate.
