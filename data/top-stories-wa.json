ACRRM President Dr Dan Halliday says that with rural indexing, specialist GPs and rural generalists in very remote areas will see an incentive increase from around $13 to $39 for a standard consultation. Halliday: ACRRM has long called for an increase in incentives for Medicare Rural Bulk Billing as part of a broader reform package and this will ease the financial pressures on patients living in rural and remote areas and the practices who care for them. We will be very interested to hear more about the MyMedicare initiative, which aims to better support patients with chronic disease and the healthcare teams that care for them. We hope this initiative will include funding models which recognise and support the unique contexts and needs of rural and remote communities and the health professionals who serve them."

The budget has allocated $6 billion to the ABC, $1.8 billion to the SBS and $5 million to AAP. Prior to the budget release, CPA and Australian Community Media penned an open letter to Treasurer Jim Chalmers calling for more federal government advertisement in regional newspapers. CPA president Andrew Manuel says regional papers are still waiting for more support. Andrew: From our conversations with the Communications Minister, the government is looking at news mapping and they're coming up with a structural approach to reform and protect regional news media. But out of the budget, there has been no actual announcement which is disappointing because our industry is really struggling at the moment. It's very concerning that there is no announcement and there has been an absolute void of advertising from the federal government."

                  "articleBody": "Let's turn back to the government’s $86 million strategy to crack down on scammers who fleece ordinary Australians out of billions of dollars each year. The ABC's national consumer affairs reporter Michael Atkin joins us with more: Michael: The strategy includes money to try to stop the fraudulent websites designed to lure people into forking over their hard-earned cash, usually with the false promise of a high-interest savings account or sky-high investment returns. These websites often clone or misuse the identities of real Australian companies and modify legitimate documents to con victims. The corporate regulator, ASIC, will be funded to identify these sites and have them taken offline. There will also be a new register to crack down on dodgy text messages, called the SMS sender ID register. It aims to reduce the scourge of messages imitating or “spoofing” private sector companies and government brand names, whether it be over a supposedly unpaid road toll or someone pretending to be concerned about your mygov account. But there are sticking points the budget hasn’t addressed. There is increasing pressure on the banking sector to lift its game. A recent report found few people are reimbursed by the big banks after falling victim to a scam and prevention and detection rates remain low. The Consumer Action Law Centre’s Stephanie Tonkin says while the budget is a promising start, she is adamant the government needs to make banks liable to reimburse scam victims, except where the victim is negligent."

The VHA said its analysis of federal funding showed spending on Victorian hospitals will decrease by $774 million in 2023-24 as COVID-19 public health funding ceases. Hospital funding is expected to increase after that as spending matches population growth. VHA CEO Leigh Clarke said the onus would fall on the state government to make up the shortfall in its upcoming budget. \"While the pandemic might seem over for many people, Victoria's health system is still feeling the effects of it. We have a trend towards more people with complex, serious needs requiring hospital care, partly due to delayed care and disease screening during the lockdowns ,\" she said. \"Our public health services are also being hit with rising bills to keep the lights on and pay for vital equipment. This all comes with a severe workforce shortage hampering how many workers they can find to deliver care.\""

                  "articleBody": "By the Specialist Reporting Team’s Loretta Florance Environment minister Tanya Plibersek has defended the budget against criticism it doesn’t do enough to back up the government’s ambitious threatened species agenda. Some environmental campaigners say much more cash is needed to tackle a backlog of conservation plans for endangered species, which are up for review. But Ms Plibersek said they have \"already locked in funding to protect our precious threatened species\". Plibersek : In the October Budget we committed $224.5 million for our Saving Native Species Program. We’re already rolling out these commitments, including over $70 million for koalas. And this budget includes almost $440 million through the Natural Heritage Trust for programs to conserve threatened species and ecosystems and restore Ramsar wetlands. She also says new funding for national parks and urban rivers will give “46 per cent of threatened animals and 25 per cent of threatened plants that live in our cities and suburbs have a real chance of survival”. But conservation groups say it’s going to take much more money to stop extinctions in Australia. “We need to invest about $2 billion a year over 30 years to end the extinction crisis and repair nature. There's nowhere near that,” the Australian Conservation Foundation’s Kelly O’Shannasy said. The minister also said the government would release legislation for public consultation on a new national EPA this year."

The announcements for these two bits of funding were made during recent trips to the southern island by Prime Minister Anthony Albanese. The $305 million for those two projects will be spaced out over the next five financial years — starting with $20 million in 2023-24. The budget also shows continued funding for a range of ongoing Tassie projects — including MarinusLink, and the redevelopment of of Hydro Tasmania's Tarraleah Power station."

Here's the Specialist Reporting Team's Leonie Thorne and Evan Young : There hasn't been an increase in the Disability Support Pension base rate, but there are other measures which may benefit some recipients. From September the base rate of the Youth DSP will increase by $40 per fortnight. The Services Australia website has more details on the Youth DSP and who's eligible. Increases to Commonwealth Rent Assistance (CRA), which supplements various Centrelink payments, may also benefit some DSP recipients. How much rent assistance you can get depends on a number of factors. This part of the Services Australia website has more details and this page lays out the special CRA rules for people receiving the DSP. The electricity bill relief and the medical prescription changes could also benefit people receiving the DSP. For more details on how Centrelink payments are changing, you can check out this explainer we prepared earlier:"

                  "articleBody": "The Treasurer has turned to the NDIS now — here's the full exchange with the ABC's Andrew Probyn. Andrew: You referenced before the $15 billion that you hope to save from lowering the growth of the NDIS and the seven years after that your ambition is for $59 billion in savings. So that's $74 billion all up. You talked about remembering the primary objective of the NDIS and Bill Shorten only this morning was saying it was designed for those who were severely disabled. Are we to deduce from this, and the fact that to get these savings, the federal government intends tightening eligibility for \nthe NDIS? Jim Chalmers says the intention is to \"moderate the growth in the cost of the scheme\", adding that there is \"broad recognition that changes need to be made in the NDIS\". Chalmers: I think it's in everybody's interest that we do that because if you go back to that primary objective that you were kind enough to reference, if you overwhelming objective here is to provide for people who are relying on the scheme that Labor designed... then you got to make sure that it is \naffordable. And so Bill and the rest of the Cabinet will work closely with the NDIA and the sectors and the providers so thatthe cost of this scheme will grow quite quickly over the life of the next decade, but where we can moderate those cost increases. Because if we can do that we'll secure the future of the scheme at the same time we \nput the budget on a more sustainable footing."

                  "articleBody": "By social affairs correspondent Norman Hermant The federal budget revealed 1.1 million households will receive an increase in Commonwealth rent assistance. It will be boosted by 15 per cent, taking the maximum payment to $180 a fortnight for a single person. Most of the recipients are pensioners or those receiving Centrelink benefits. \"It’s good, it’s important that it’s been raised,” says Homelessness Australia CEO Kate Colvin. “When people are struggling to put three meals a day on the table, every dollar makes a difference.” The increase has been budgeted at $2.7 billion over four years. But Colvin says an extra $15.50 a week won’t make much difference to how people feel about their ability to pay the rent. “It’s just that rents have increased so much,” she says. A recent report from Anglicare found less than one per cent of private rental properties were deemed affordable. Before the budget, the Australian Council of Social Service had recommended doubling the Commonwealth rent assistance payment. Last week, the ABC spoke with 20-year-old Abby Manning, who until recently had relied on the Youth Allowance payment and Commonwealth rent assistance while studying at TAFE. After seeing the budget last night, she says the rent assistance increase wouldn’t make much difference. “I was hoping the government would take this as a chance to do something bigger and better,” she says. “Obviously I’m disappointed. I mean, it’s like two dollars a day.”"

The Treasurer says he doesn't pre-empt decisions made by the Reserve Bank board. Chalmers: Never have. Never will. Don't intend to do that today. The defining influence on our decisions around the cost of living package, our decisions around the growth package, and the historic \nrestraint that we have shown in spending has been this inflation challenge. We are supremely confident that the budget that we handed down last night will take some of these cost-of-living pressures off without adding to inflation. The Treasurer says \"such a big proportion of that spending in 23-24 is legacy issues that we had to clean up\". Chalmers: The fact that the cost of living package \nonly adds 0.1% of GDP in that period, the fact that our energy plan, the combination of the price caps and the bill relief takes three-quarters of a click off inflation next year. All of these things, I think, are important demonstrations for why so many of the bank economists in particular have come out today and said at \nworst the impact on the economy is neutral and many of them have said better than that. There won't be unanimity about that, you can always find if you look hard enough, you can always find a view on either side of the spectrum."

                  "articleBody": "Let's turn back to the National Press Club now, where the Treasurer is taking questions. First up, Jim Chalmers is asked why those who receive the single parenting payment won't benefit from the $40 increase to Jobseeker and other working-age payments. Chalmers: The $40 base rate increase to JobSeeker and some of the other working-age payments was all about addressing the lowest payments in the system. When it comes to [single] parenting payment, what we have done is quite dramatically expand the eligibility for that. What it means if you're on parenting payment single, the difference between that and JobSeeker is about $177 a fortnight. And so parenting payment single is already a higher rate, about 95% of the age pension as I \nunderstand it. We're expanding eligibility for it and introducing more generous income arrangements for it as well."

                  "articleBody": "Everything’s coming up Milhouse for Australia’s tech sector, which has given the treasurer a thumbs up. They’ve told national technology reporter Danny Tran that the budget is a welcome step after months of data breaches, cyber-attacks and sirens sounding over the power of artificial intelligence. Here's the latest from Danny: Misha Schubert from Science and Technology Australia says the budget will allow Australia to keep pace with the rapid scale of advancement we’re seeing on the horizon. Misha: Unless we make those deep investments, we know that Australia will fall behind, will lose competitive advantage and that will come at a cost of Australian jobs and living standards, so the race is on to keep Australia at the forefront of an array of new frontier technologies. Cybersecurity has come away as a winner with the federal government announcing $101.6 million over the next five years to boost our cyber capabilities. That bucket of cash includes $46.5 million over four years to set up a Coordinator for Cyber Security, who will be tasked with making sure Australia can manage any cyber threats coming our way. On the domestic side of things, small businesses will also get a helping hand to defend themselves against cybercriminals with a new ‘cyber wardens’ program, which will cost about $23.4 million over three years. Cash will also be pumped into stronger privacy protections for Australians."

Our commitment to banking revenue upgrades means we'll have $300 billion less debt, saving us around $83 billion of interest costs by the end of the medium-term. And while the commitments of the Prime Minister and the states on the NDIS \nwill secure its future and reduce payments growth, this combined with some modest but meaningful tax changes to improve our revenue base, all of this has contributed significantly to a marked decline in the structural deficit by the end of the medium-term."

The budget has some support to help deal with this growing problem. Here’s more from national consumer affairs reporter, Michael Atkin: Michael: The federal government was alarmed by the record scam losses revealed last month and this budget has committed far more money to protecting Australians – in total just over $86 million over four years. The stories of those who lose everything to scammers are devastating and the financial blow can impact a family for generations or cripple a business. Victims I’ve interviewed express frustration that more isn’t being done to address gaps that are exploited by scammers on social media platforms, telco networks and in the banking system. Consumer groups have been pushing hard for banks to be made liable to repay scam funds, which they say would drive innovation. It’s something the sector has outright rejected, arguing it would reduce personal responsibility. The biggest ticket item in the budget is establishing a National Anti-Scam Centre to be run by the consumer watchdog, the ACCC — a move first announced in November. We’re still waiting on the detail but the government says it will involve government, the big banks, telcos and others to prevent and disrupt scam activity. It also says industry will be held to account with tough new codes."

Here's what political reporter Jake Evans says: Hi Angie, people on the Carer Allowance will be eligible for up to $500 in energy bill relief - the exact amount depends on which state you live in. Grandparents who are full-time carers of grandchildren who are children of a veteran will also be made eligible for supports under the Defence, Veterans and Families Acute Support Package Act, which can include childcare, counselling, household assistance, school transport and other services. The single parenting payment is available to eligible carers and that scheme will be extended to include people with children up to 14 years of age, meaning they will receive a higher payment than they would if they were on JobSeeker. The $40 base rate increase being applied to a number of payments is not being applied to Carer Allowance."

NT Treasurer Eva Lawler’s inaugural budget features a massive infrastructure spend planned for the impending financial year, with $2.1 billion pegged mainly for the jurisdiction’s roads and housing. While the construction and mining sectors have applauded this year’s allocations, there’s not been any huge departmental increases put on the table for health, education or the NT Police force. The NT opposition, police union and territory’s social services council have all criticised the 2023 NT budget's priorities, saying more focus should've been placed on the region's most vulnerable. Opposition Leader Lia Finocchiaro said police were all but ignored in the middle of a \"crime crisis\"."

I've passed it to political reporter Jake Evans who says: There's a big \"TBC\" over the whole higher education sector, because the government is currently in negotiations with unions, universities and others to develop a \"University Accord\". That deal would be very wide-ranging, looking not only at tertiary education funding and structure, but also at student loans and loan repayment. For now, there's no new incentive schemes or loan relief, besides a technical decision by the government to forgo $21 million worth of debt it would be owed over the next decade from loans issued in 2017 and 2018 under the VET FEE-HELP program, due to delays in the transfer of those loans to the Australian Taxation Office. It means students currently paying off loans face a 7 per cent increase on June 1 when they are indexed, which will add thousands more to many student debts."

I've put your question to political reporter Jake Evan s who says: There is no new money for long COVID management in this budget. However the federal government has committed $50 million for further research on long COVID to be paid through the Medical Research Future Fund. A parliamentary committee inquiry into long COVID and repeat infections was released just at the end of last month, which included recommendations for long COVID clinics to be established in some public hospitals, more support and education. The government is developing its national plan on long COVID which it says will consider the findings of that committee's inquiry, so we may see more on this in the future."

                  "headline": "Conservation groups say the budget doesn't do enough for the environment",
                  "articleBody": "By the Specialist Reporting Team's Loretta Florance: The government came into office with a mandate to improve Australia's environmental record, but conservation groups say while the budget has some promising measures on climate change, it doesn't provide nearly enough money to back the government's ambitious agenda to do more to protect the country's natural environment. The Australian Conservation Foundation's Kelly O'Shanassy welcomes investment in \"climate action, renewable energy and clean exports\", including $2 billion to speed up development of Australia's hydrogen industry and $1.3 billion towards energy efficiency in houses. \"That's really important because Australians are struggling with the cost of living and investing in energy efficiency in homes,\" she says. There was also $121 million over four years to make good on the government's promise to set up a new national body, Environment Protection Australia (EPA), as well as another $51.5 million over four years for a new environment information agency. Ms O'Shanassy says that's \"a good investment in forming a new agency\". But the public is yet to see legislation to establish a national EPA, and the Wilderness Society's Tim Beshara says the government needs to get on with it. \"The new EPA and a data collection agency is a good start for figuring out how we do address the problems that we're facing on the nature side,\" he says. \"[But] I think that's a patch-up for where we should have been. I think that should have been in last year's budget and we should have been well advanced from where we're at right now to the reform agenda.\" Both groups also say the government hasn't put any significant new money behind its ambitious goal of zero extinctions. \"There's nothing in this budget that is going to lead to additional species coming off the [endangered] list in the right way — that is not becoming extinct, but actually becoming more and more common, less and less rare,\" Beshara says. \"The Australian government has obligations for hundreds of species to have put in place a recovery plan and to fund that, and the backlog on writing those plans and implementing those plans and funding those plans is rising. \"So, until there is dedicated additional substantive funding put into endangered species recovery, things are going to continue to decline. It's hard not to see we're going to have more extinctions [under] the Albanese government.\""

However, the amount you receive will differ from state to state, as the money is jointly funded and the federal government has had to strike eight different deals with each state and territory. $500 will be offered in NSW, Victoria, Queensland, South Australia and Tasmania $350 in total relief will be available in Western Australia and the territories $650 will also be available to eligible small businesses in states that have matched the relief."

Andrews said there were positive signs in the budget for Victoria, declaring \"the decade of rip off is over.\" \"You can’t fix nine years of neglect in just one budget but there are good positive signs, but we’ll keep the pressure on, of course, because we want to get our fair share,\" he said. Mr Andrews said the health initiatives announced last night were \"a good first step\" in improving medical care across the country. \"National Cabinet agreed earlier this year that health is the number one issue and it was very pleasing to see significant investments – not everything – but a big next step in last night’s federal budget. \"Particularly, longer consultations, higher payments to GPs and higher rebates particularly for vulnerable people. This is all about a better primary care system.\" Andrews said he would discuss more moves to reform the health system at a health-only National Cabinet meeting before the end of the year. There was no money allocated last night towards the 2026 Commonwealth Games, which Victoria is hosting in regional centres, but the Premier said that doesn’t mean there won’t be a federal contribution. \"The Commonwealth Games is not happening next week so we do have time and we do have some optimism that the Albanese government will be a partner,\" he said."

My daughter did her bit is the government going to step up? - Richard. Hi Richard, thanks for writing in. I've put your question to political reporter Jake Evans who says: We still don't have details on the future of that policy or much at all of the tertiary sector, because the federal government is still reviewing the higher education sector, with a plan to introduce a \"University Accord\" by the end of the year. There were no new measures for universties this budget — but expect more to come in the future."

The government is also increasing the Medicare levy low-income thresholds for singles, families and seniors and pensioners from July 1, 2022, which means more people will be exempt from paying the Medicare levy in their 2022-23 tax returns.

But here's national technology reporter, Danny Tran: Artificial intelligence is getting a boost, with the federal government tipping in $101.2 million over the next five years to help businesses integrate AI and quantum technologies. That includes expanding the National AI Centre and its role in making sure the technology is responsible (I, Robot, anyone?) as well as setting up the Australian Centre for Quantum Growth. Misha Schubert from Science and Technology Australia says this type of investment is important: \"Every time anyone enters a prompt or an instruction into ChatGPT or a generative AI tool, it is hoovering that up and building a complex profile about us. \"So [it is] really important that we diligently deepen our investments in ethical and responsible use of AI and the sort of safeguards around privacy and copyright and security on generative AI tools.\" Simon Bush from the Australian Information Industry Association, the peak body for the information and communications technology sector, says we have a \"very limited\" opportunity to get this technology right. \"We are competing with our trading partners, both friendly and not so friendly, in relation to areas like AI and Quantum,\" he says. \"This funding enables smaller Australian innovative companies to access government support, to commercialise their IP and their technology, to really bring that to the market and also [retain] really smart people, so [we] don't lose them overseas. \"It’s a really good down payment on securing Australia’s future.\""

Julie: We know that many aspects of the cost of living are at near-record highs, including rental prices, petrol, groceries and other essentials, which makes it even less sustainable for a Jobseeker recipient to live a dignified life. We saw during the pandemic that increased payments reduced measures of poverty and housing stress, but a very modest increase of $2.80 per day will sadly make little difference to many. Our political leaders must create a fair social safety net that ensures all Jobseeker recipients can afford an adequate standard of living."

The federal budget announced a 10 per cent increase in agricultural levies to fund biosecurity activities and organisations, expecting it to raise $153 million over three years. Littleproud told ABC NewsRadio this was an \"outrageous move\". \"They are going to tax farmers to pay for the biosecurity costs of their competitors to import product into this country, and that has to be passed on to the consumer,\" he said, adding it would not help address food price inflation. He also said regional Australians would have few benefits from Labor's cost-of-living package, stressing what was needed in regional Australia was infrastructure and new childcare places. He was also concerned that new Medicare boosts would lead to the closure of regional pharmacies, meaning regional Australians might face more accessibility issues in the future. \"We feel like the forgotten Australians,\" he said."

                  "articleBody": "By Jemima Burt Queensland's peak social service body says the federal government needs to do more to meet the demand for housing in Queensland. This year's budget includes a significant investment in more social housing around the country, an increase to rent assistance, and concessions for build to rent projects. But Aimee McVeigh from the Queensland Council of Social Service said research shows a significant number of Queenslanders are missing out on access to affordable housing. \"Our research shows that we have 300,000 Queenslanders with unmet housing needs … If we can see that federally the government is committing to 20,000 social houses across the country it is clear that the current plan bears no relationship to the need,\" she said. She said despite modest rises to welfare payments, there are many Queenslanders who will continue to live in poverty. \"There is in this federal budget an increase of less than $3 a day for that payment. \"Clearly it isn't enough to go anywhere near lifting those almost half a million Queenslanders out of poverty,\" Ms McVeigh said."

                  "articleBody": "By Tim Callanan Victorian social services groups have cautiously welcomed “modest” increases in support in the federal budget for people struggling with the cost of living crisis. That includes an increase to the JobSeeker rate by $40 a fortnight and the government’s energy bill relief plan. Victorian Council of Social Service CEO Emma King said there were positive moves in the budget to help vulnerable people. “There's critical support in there for single parents, people on low incomes who need health care, and it kicked off really important investment to retrofit low-income homes to improve energy efficiency,” she said. However, Ms King had one eye on the upcoming state budget, which Premier Daniel Andrews has repeatedly warned will be “tough”. “We've got a real challenge on our hands in terms of what we've got to look forward to in looking at the Victorian budget and where those cuts might be,” she said."

McKenzie: This is a missed opportunity to permanently lower people’s power bills. To meet the climate challenge head on, Australia needs to urgently unlock the most affordable energy source available, renewables. Sure, this Budget provides renewables assistance to 170,000 households. But when you consider the critical challenge of electrifying everything with renewable power, backed with storage, for 10.8 million households, that barely gets us off the starting blocks. The Labor Government has demonstrated in this Budget that they want to support Australians who are struggling. Climate change makes every Australian vulnerable, so the scale of investment on climate action needs to match the task ahead of us."

There's also $3 million to look at the feasibility of an intermodal terminal in Forbes, as part of the Inland Rail program.

                  "articleBody": "What happened to the shared equity (help to buy) scheme that Labor took to the last election? Has this been quietly shelved or is it in progress. Have heard nothing on this since 21 May. Presumably it's an inflationary measure, but still a game changer for those lagging behind the housing market  - Josh. Hi Josh! Thanks for writing in. I've passed on your question to political reporter Jake Evans who says: The Help to Buy scheme was funded in the treasurer's first budget in October last year. The federal government committed in that budget to $324.6 million over four years to establish the scheme to help people on low to moderate incomes to purchase a new or existing home with an equity contribution from the government. The treasurer said in his budget speech last year that the scheme would assist up to 40,000 people."

We know that when the vote, the postal ballot was held on marriage equality, then people in that community felt under pressure as well and we have been conscious about that.\""

It is harder and harder, particularly for women over 55, to get back into work. Big increases in homelessness and the like and we've tried to provide extra help there.\""

She aded there was another missed opportunity to tackle the structural deficit. \"Business did all the heavy lifting last night and there is nothing to drive our investment against the backdrop of other countries who are pushing hard into this. \"The hard work is fixing and reforming government services. By that, not cost cutting but going to digital services, getting improved outcomes for people, making sure we slow the rate of growth in these services, that they are efficient and effective for people and fix all of the issues in our federation.\""

Halliday: ACRRM has long called for an increase in incentives for Medicare Rural Bulk Billing as part of a broader reform package and this will ease the financial pressures on patients living in rural and remote areas and the practices who care for them. We will be very interested to hear more about the MyMedicare initiative, which aims to better support patients with chronic disease and the healthcare teams that care for them. We hope this initiative will include funding models which recognise and support the unique contexts and needs of rural and remote communities and the health professionals who serve them.",

The budget has allocated $6 billion to the ABC, $1.8 billion to the SBS and $5 million to AAP. Prior to the budget release, CPA and Australian Community Media penned an open letter to Treasurer Jim Chalmers calling for more federal government advertisement in regional newspapers. CPA president Andrew Manuel says regional papers are still waiting for more support. Andrew: From our conversations with the Communications Minister, the government is looking at news mapping and they're coming up with a structural approach to reform and protect regional news media. But out of the budget, there has been no actual announcement which is disappointing because our industry is really struggling at the moment. It's very concerning that there is no announcement and there has been an absolute void of advertising from the federal government.",

The ABC's national consumer affairs reporter Michael Atkin joins us with more: Michael: The strategy includes money to try to stop the fraudulent websites designed to lure people into forking over their hard-earned cash, usually with the false promise of a high-interest savings account or sky-high investment returns. These websites often clone or misuse the identities of real Australian companies and modify legitimate documents to con victims. The corporate regulator, ASIC, will be funded to identify these sites and have them taken offline. There will also be a new register to crack down on dodgy text messages, called the SMS sender ID register. It aims to reduce the scourge of messages imitating or “spoofing” private sector companies and government brand names, whether it be over a supposedly unpaid road toll or someone pretending to be concerned about your mygov account. But there are sticking points the budget hasn’t addressed. There is increasing pressure on the banking sector to lift its game. A recent report found few people are reimbursed by the big banks after falling victim to a scam and prevention and detection rates remain low. The Consumer Action Law Centre’s Stephanie Tonkin says while the budget is a promising start, she is adamant the government needs to make banks liable to reimburse scam victims, except where the victim is negligent.",

The VHA said its analysis of federal funding showed spending on Victorian hospitals will decrease by $774 million in 2023-24 as COVID-19 public health funding ceases. Hospital funding is expected to increase after that as spending matches population growth. VHA CEO Leigh Clarke said the onus would fall on the state government to make up the shortfall in its upcoming budget. \"While the pandemic might seem over for many people, Victoria's health system is still feeling the effects of it. We have a trend towards more people with complex, serious needs requiring hospital care, partly due to delayed care and disease screening during the lockdowns ,\" she said. \"Our public health services are also being hit with rising bills to keep the lights on and pay for vital equipment. This all comes with a severe workforce shortage hampering how many workers they can find to deliver care.\"",

Some environmental campaigners say much more cash is needed to tackle a backlog of conservation plans for endangered species, which are up for review. But Ms Plibersek said they have \"already locked in funding to protect our precious threatened species\". Plibersek : In the October Budget we committed $224.5 million for our Saving Native Species Program. We’re already rolling out these commitments, including over $70 million for koalas. And this budget includes almost $440 million through the Natural Heritage Trust for programs to conserve threatened species and ecosystems and restore Ramsar wetlands. She also says new funding for national parks and urban rivers will give “46 per cent of threatened animals and 25 per cent of threatened plants that live in our cities and suburbs have a real chance of survival”. But conservation groups say it’s going to take much more money to stop extinctions in Australia. “We need to invest about $2 billion a year over 30 years to end the extinction crisis and repair nature. There's nowhere near that,” the Australian Conservation Foundation’s Kelly O’Shannasy said. The minister also said the government would release legislation for public consultation on a new national EPA this year.",

The announcements for these two bits of funding were made during recent trips to the southern island by Prime Minister Anthony Albanese. The $305 million for those two projects will be spaced out over the next five financial years — starting with $20 million in 2023-24.

Here's the Specialist Reporting Team's Leonie Thorne and Evan Young : There hasn't been an increase in the Disability Support Pension base rate, but there are other measures which may benefit some recipients. From September the base rate of the Youth DSP will increase by $40 per fortnight. The Services Australia website has more details on the Youth DSP and who's eligible. Increases to Commonwealth Rent Assistance (CRA), which supplements various Centrelink payments, may also benefit some DSP recipients. How much rent assistance you can get depends on a number of factors. This part of the Services Australia website has more details and this page lays out the special CRA rules for people receiving the DSP. The electricity bill relief and the medical prescription changes could also benefit people receiving the DSP. For more details on how Centrelink payments are changing, you can check out this explainer we prepared earlier:",

Andrew: You referenced before the $15 billion that you hope to save from lowering the growth of the NDIS and the seven years after that your ambition is for $59 billion in savings. So that's $74 billion all up. You talked about remembering the primary objective of the NDIS and Bill Shorten only this morning was saying it was designed for those who were severely disabled. Are we to deduce from this, and the fact that to get these savings, the federal government intends tightening eligibility for \nthe NDIS? Jim Chalmers says the intention is to \"moderate the growth in the cost of the scheme\", adding that there is \"broad recognition that changes need to be made in the NDIS\". Chalmers: I think it's in everybody's interest that we do that because if you go back to that primary objective that you were kind enough to reference, if you overwhelming objective here is to provide for people who are relying on the scheme that Labor designed... then you got to make sure that it is \naffordable. And so Bill and the rest of the Cabinet will work closely with the NDIA and the sectors and the providers so thatthe cost of this scheme will grow quite quickly over the life of the next decade, but where we can moderate those cost increases. Because if we can do that we'll secure the future of the scheme at the same time we \nput the budget on a more sustainable footing.",

                  "plaintext": "By social affairs correspondent Norman Hermant The federal budget revealed 1.1 million households will receive an increase in Commonwealth rent assistance. It will be boosted by 15 per cent, taking the maximum payment to $180 a fortnight for a single person. Most of the recipients are pensioners or those receiving Centrelink benefits. \"It’s good, it’s important that it’s been raised,” says Homelessness Australia CEO Kate Colvin. “When people are struggling to put three meals a day on the table, every dollar makes a difference.” The increase has been budgeted at $2.7 billion over four years. But Colvin says an extra $15.50 a week won’t make much difference to how people feel about their ability to pay the rent. “It’s just that rents have increased so much,” she says. A recent report from Anglicare found less than one per cent of private rental properties were deemed affordable. Before the budget, the Australian Council of Social Service had recommended doubling the Commonwealth rent assistance payment. Last week, the ABC spoke with 20-year-old Abby Manning, who until recently had relied on the Youth Allowance payment and Commonwealth rent assistance while studying at TAFE. After seeing the budget last night, she says the rent assistance increase wouldn’t make much difference. “I was hoping the government would take this as a chance to do something bigger and better,” she says. “Obviously I’m disappointed. I mean, it’s like two dollars a day.”",

The Treasurer says he doesn't pre-empt decisions made by the Reserve Bank board. Chalmers: Never have. Never will. Don't intend to do that today. The defining influence on our decisions around the cost of living package, our decisions around the growth package, and the historic \nrestraint that we have shown in spending has been this inflation challenge. We are supremely confident that the budget that we handed down last night will take some of these cost-of-living pressures off without adding to inflation. The Treasurer says \"such a big proportion of that spending in 23-24 is legacy issues that we had to clean up\". Chalmers: The fact that the cost of living package \nonly adds 0.1% of GDP in that period, the fact that our energy plan, the combination of the price caps and the bill relief takes three-quarters of a click off inflation next year. All of these things, I think, are important demonstrations for why so many of the bank economists in particular have come out today and said at \nworst the impact on the economy is neutral and many of them have said better than that. There won't be unanimity about that, you can always find if you look hard enough, you can always find a view on either side of the spectrum.",

Chalmers: The $40 base rate increase to JobSeeker and some of the other working-age payments was all about addressing the lowest payments in the system. When it comes to [single] parenting payment, what we have done is quite dramatically expand the eligibility for that. What it means if you're on parenting payment single, the difference between that and JobSeeker is about $177 a fortnight.

They’ve told national technology reporter Danny Tran that the budget is a welcome step after months of data breaches, cyber-attacks and sirens sounding over the power of artificial intelligence. Here's the latest from Danny: Misha Schubert from Science and Technology Australia says the budget will allow Australia to keep pace with the rapid scale of advancement we’re seeing on the horizon. Misha: Unless we make those deep investments, we know that Australia will fall behind, will lose competitive advantage and that will come at a cost of Australian jobs and living standards, so the race is on to keep Australia at the forefront of an array of new frontier technologies. Cybersecurity has come away as a winner with the federal government announcing $101.6 million over the next five years to boost our cyber capabilities. That bucket of cash includes $46.5 million over four years to set up a Coordinator for Cyber Security, who will be tasked with making sure Australia can manage any cyber threats coming our way. On the domestic side of things, small businesses will also get a helping hand to defend themselves against cybercriminals with a new ‘cyber wardens’ program, which will cost about $23.4 million over three years. Cash will also be pumped into stronger privacy protections for Australians.",

The budget has some support to help deal with this growing problem. Here’s more from national consumer affairs reporter, Michael Atkin: Michael: The federal government was alarmed by the record scam losses revealed last month and this budget has committed far more money to protecting Australians – in total just over $86 million over four years. The stories of those who lose everything to scammers are devastating and the financial blow can impact a family for generations or cripple a business. Victims I’ve interviewed express frustration that more isn’t being done to address gaps that are exploited by scammers on social media platforms, telco networks and in the banking system. Consumer groups have been pushing hard for banks to be made liable to repay scam funds, which they say would drive innovation. It’s something the sector has outright rejected, arguing it would reduce personal responsibility. The biggest ticket item in the budget is establishing a National Anti-Scam Centre to be run by the consumer watchdog, the ACCC — a move first announced in November. We’re still waiting on the detail but the government says it will involve government, the big banks, telcos and others to prevent and disrupt scam activity. It also says industry will be held to account with tough new codes.",

Grandparents who are full-time carers of grandchildren who are children of a veteran will also be made eligible for supports under the Defence, Veterans and Families Acute Support Package Act, which can include childcare, counselling, household assistance, school transport and other services. The single parenting payment is available to eligible carers and that scheme will be extended to include people with children up to 14 years of age, meaning they will receive a higher payment than they would if they were on JobSeeker. The $40 base rate increase being applied to a number of payments is not being applied to Carer Allowance.",

Those additional payments are described as being for the ABC to continue to support local news and current affairs services, and for the SBS to continue to make news content available for Chinese and Arabic speaking communities in Australia.",

Ben Bartl is the principal solicitor with the Tenant's Union of Tasmania has told The World Today any increase is welcome. \"It's the biggest increase (in rent assistance) in more than three decades and it will provide cost of living relief for many Tasmanians,\" he said. But Mr Bartl says they won't fix a broken system. \"It shouldn't be forgotten that rents across Tasmania have increased by $75 a week over the last two years. So while the increase (to assistance) will provide some cost of living relief, it doesn't go far enough.\"",

I've passed it to political reporter Jake Evans who says: There's a big \"TBC\" over the whole higher education sector, because the government is currently in negotiations with unions, universities and others to develop a \"University Accord\". That deal would be very wide-ranging, looking not only at tertiary education funding and structure, but also at student loans and loan repayment. For now, there's no new incentive schemes or loan relief, besides a technical decision by the government to forgo $21 million worth of debt it would be owed over the next decade from loans issued in 2017 and 2018 under the VET FEE-HELP program, due to delays in the transfer of those loans to the Australian Taxation Office. It means students currently paying off loans face a 7 per cent increase on June 1 when they are indexed, which will add thousands more to many student debts.",

I've put your question to political reporter Jake Evan s who says: There is no new money for long COVID management in this budget. However the federal government has committed $50 million for further research on long COVID to be paid through the Medical Research Future Fund. A parliamentary committee inquiry into long COVID and repeat infections was released just at the end of last month, which included recommendations for long COVID clinics to be established in some public hospitals, more support and education. The government is developing its national plan on long COVID which it says will consider the findings of that committee's inquiry, so we may see more on this in the future.",

The Australian Conservation Foundation's Kelly O'Shanassy welcomes investment in \"climate action, renewable energy and clean exports\", including $2 billion to speed up development of Australia's hydrogen industry and $1.3 billion towards energy efficiency in houses. \"That's really important because Australians are struggling with the cost of living and investing in energy efficiency in homes,\" she says. There was also $121 million over four years to make good on the government's promise to set up a new national body, Environment Protection Australia (EPA), as well as another $51.5 million over four years for a new environment information agency. Ms O'Shanassy says that's \"a good investment in forming a new agency\". But the public is yet to see legislation to establish a national EPA, and the Wilderness Society's Tim Beshara says the government needs to get on with it. \"The new EPA and a data collection agency is a good start for figuring out how we do address the problems that we're facing on the nature side,\" he says. \"[But] I think that's a patch-up for where we should have been. I think that should have been in last year's budget and we should have been well advanced from where we're at right now to the reform agenda.\" Both groups also say the government hasn't put any significant new money behind its ambitious goal of zero extinctions. \"There's nothing in this budget that is going to lead to additional species coming off the [endangered] list in the right way — that is not becoming extinct, but actually becoming more and more common, less and less rare,\" Beshara says. \"The Australian government has obligations for hundreds of species to have put in place a recovery plan and to fund that, and the backlog on writing those plans and implementing those plans and funding those plans is rising. \"So, until there is dedicated additional substantive funding put into endangered species recovery, things are going to continue to decline. It's hard not to see we're going to have more extinctions [under] the Albanese government.\"",

Andrews said there were positive signs in the budget for Victoria, declaring \"the decade of rip off is over.\" \"You can’t fix nine years of neglect in just one budget but there are good positive signs, but we’ll keep the pressure on, of course, because we want to get our fair share,\" he said. Mr Andrews said the health initiatives announced last night were \"a good first step\" in improving medical care across the country. \"National Cabinet agreed earlier this year that health is the number one issue and it was very pleasing to see significant investments – not everything – but a big next step in last night’s federal budget. \"Particularly, longer consultations, higher payments to GPs and higher rebates particularly for vulnerable people. This is all about a better primary care system.\" Andrews said he would discuss more moves to reform the health system at a health-only National Cabinet meeting before the end of the year. There was no money allocated last night towards the 2026 Commonwealth Games, which Victoria is hosting in regional centres, but the Premier said that doesn’t mean there won’t be a federal contribution. \"The Commonwealth Games is not happening next week so we do have time and we do have some optimism that the Albanese government will be a partner,\" he said.",

This will apply to pensioners, Commonwealth Seniors Health Card holders, Family Tax Benefit A and B recipients and small business customers of electricity retailers. The government is also increasing the Medicare levy low-income thresholds for singles, families and seniors and pensioners from July 1, 2022, which means more people will be exempt from paying the Medicare levy in their 2022-23 tax returns. For medicines, the budget includes a $2.2 billion increase to access for medicines through the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme.",

But here's national technology reporter, Danny Tran: Artificial intelligence is getting a boost, with the federal government tipping in $101.2 million over the next five years to help businesses integrate AI and quantum technologies. That includes expanding the National AI Centre and its role in making sure the technology is responsible (I, Robot, anyone?) as well as setting up the Australian Centre for Quantum Growth. Misha Schubert from Science and Technology Australia says this type of investment is important: \"Every time anyone enters a prompt or an instruction into ChatGPT or a generative AI tool, it is hoovering that up and building a complex profile about us. \"So [it is] really important that we diligently deepen our investments in ethical and responsible use of AI and the sort of safeguards around privacy and copyright and security on generative AI tools.\" Simon Bush from the Australian Information Industry Association, the peak body for the information and communications technology sector, says we have a \"very limited\" opportunity to get this technology right. \"We are competing with our trading partners, both friendly and not so friendly, in relation to areas like AI and Quantum,\" he says. \"This funding enables smaller Australian innovative companies to access government support, to commercialise their IP and their technology, to really bring that to the market and also [retain] really smart people, so [we] don't lose them overseas. \"It’s a really good down payment on securing Australia’s future.\"",

Littleproud told ABC NewsRadio this was an \"outrageous move\". \"They are going to tax farmers to pay for the biosecurity costs of their competitors to import product into this country, and that has to be passed on to the consumer,\" he said, adding it would not help address food price inflation. He also said regional Australians would have few benefits from Labor's cost-of-living package, stressing what was needed in regional Australia was infrastructure and new childcare places. He was also concerned that new Medicare boosts would lead to the closure of regional pharmacies, meaning regional Australians might face more accessibility issues in the future. \"We feel like the forgotten Australians,\" he said.",

The budget offers a $14.6 billion cost-of-living package, including a $40 per fortnight increase to JobSeeker, which the Liberal Party hasn't yet taken a position on. \"Critically, in the new initiatives that Labor has brought forward there's $2 of extra spending for every $1 of revenue. And this is the critical point: That's inflationary,\" he told RN this morning. \"What we needed was a budget that was going to take pressure off inflation, in the process then take pressure off interest rates, and of course that helps everybody. \"That's why the right budget to unite Australians, to help all Australians was a budget that was going to take those pressures away.\" You can listen to the Shadow Treasurer's full interview on Radio National with Patricia Karvelas here.",

This year's budget includes a significant investment in more social housing around the country, an increase to rent assistance, and concessions for build to rent projects. But Aimee McVeigh from the Queensland Council of Social Service said research shows a significant number of Queenslanders are missing out on access to affordable housing. \"Our research shows that we have 300,000 Queenslanders with unmet housing needs … If we can see that federally the government is committing to 20,000 social houses across the country it is clear that the current plan bears no relationship to the need,\" she said. She said despite modest rises to welfare payments, there are many Queenslanders who will continue to live in poverty. \"There is in this federal budget an increase of less than $3 a day for that payment. \"Clearly it isn't enough to go anywhere near lifting those almost half a million Queenslanders out of poverty,\" Ms McVeigh said.",

That includes an increase to the JobSeeker rate by $40 a fortnight and the government’s energy bill relief plan. Victorian Council of Social Service CEO Emma King said there were positive moves in the budget to help vulnerable people. “There's critical support in there for single parents, people on low incomes who need health care, and it kicked off really important investment to retrofit low-income homes to improve energy efficiency,” she said. However, Ms King had one eye on the upcoming state budget, which Premier Daniel Andrews has repeatedly warned will be “tough”. “We've got a real challenge on our hands in terms of what we've got to look forward to in looking at the Victorian budget and where those cuts might be,” she said.",

Extra money has also been promised for roads in Northern WA, and $16.3 million dollars for Perth to host the World Masters Games, if Australia's bid is successful. Eligible Western Australians will only receive a $350 electricity credit … below the $500 going to those along the east coast. From next year the state's GST payments will be slightly higher than forecast last year, growing to more than $9 billion in the 2025-26 financial year.",

There's also $3 million to look at the feasibility of an intermodal terminal in Forbes, as part of the Inland Rail program.

I've passed on your question to political reporter Jake Evans who says: The Help to Buy scheme was funded in the treasurer's first budget in October last year. The federal government committed in that budget to $324.6 million over four years to establish the scheme to help people on low to moderate incomes to purchase a new or existing home with an equity contribution from the government. The treasurer said in his budget speech last year that the scheme would assist up to 40,000 people.",

What is right about that picture?\" News Breakfast presenter Michael Rowland asks Treasurer Jim Chalmers. \"I was asked yesterday how much they'd cost and because there's an extra year of these cuts in the forward estimates, it's a bigger number than it was last name,\" Chalmers said. \"You can see the disparity between the figures and how that would be viewed by people. \"First of all, those tax cuts kick in at $45,000 and it's important that we give back some of the bracket creep in the jargon, particularly to people on low and middle incomes, but we haven't changed our position on the stage 3 tax cuts. \"What we've done in the budget last night is to provide some help for people who are doing it toughest, the most vulnerable people in our community and that shows where our priorities are. \"We haven't changed our position. They don't come in for more than a year now. They haven't actually been a focus of the deliberations for this budget at all.\"",

Treasurer Jim Chalmers says \"it's a really important change.\" \"One of the most concerning parts of the community of Australians who can't find works is over-55s and particularly women over 55 ,\" he told News Breakfast. \"The advice that we receive from the expert committees we set up is that this is a big and growing challenge for us. It is harder and harder, particularly for women over 55, to get back into work. Big increases in homelessness and the like and we've tried to provide extra help there.\"",

              "plaintext": "By the Specialist Reporting Team’s Loretta Florance Environment minister Tanya Plibersek has defended the budget against criticism it doesn’t do enough to back up the government’s ambitious threatened species agenda. Some environmental campaigners say much more cash is needed to tackle a backlog of conservation plans for endangered species, which are up for review. But Ms Plibersek said they have \"already locked in funding to protect our precious threatened species\". Plibersek : In the October Budget we committed $224.5 million for our Saving Native Species Program. We’re already rolling out these commitments, including over $70 million for koalas. And this budget includes almost $440 million through the Natural Heritage Trust for programs to conserve threatened species and ecosystems and restore Ramsar wetlands. She also says new funding for national parks and urban rivers will give “46 per cent of threatened animals and 25 per cent of threatened plants that live in our cities and suburbs have a real chance of survival”. But conservation groups say it’s going to take much more money to stop extinctions in Australia. “We need to invest about $2 billion a year over 30 years to end the extinction crisis and repair nature. There's nowhere near that,” the Australian Conservation Foundation’s Kelly O’Shannasy said. The minister also said the government would release legislation for public consultation on a new national EPA this year.",

                  "headline": "Virgin Australia says IPO planning advanced, finalising capital return",
                  "articleBody": "Planning for Virgin Australia's upcoming initial public offering (IPO) is \"well advanced\", chairman Ryan Cotton said on Wednesday in an internal email that also outlined bonus payments to the airline's shareholders and staff after a return to profit. Cotton said Australia's second-biggest airline was days away from finalising a capital return. Investors led by US private equity firm Bain Capital will share a $730 million payment, according to Reuters, citing a source who was not authorised to speak publicly. It will be structured as a capital reduction rather than a dividend, with Bain Capital taking around 90% followed by Richard Branson's Virgin Group with 5% and the rest going to the remaining shareholders, the source added. A Virgin Australia spokesperson confirmed the contents of the internal email. A Bain Capital spokesperson declined to comment. The airline had sought up to $450 million of loans for the capital return, Reuters reported in March. The rewards to staff and shareholders come as Virgin Australia, the key domestic rival to Qantas, prepares for what is likely to be one of the country's biggest listings this year. \"I can also confirm the IPO planning is well advanced,\" Cotton said in the email to staff seen by Reuters. \"While there is still no date set and our ultimate window of opportunity will depend on market conditions, we are hopeful this process will progress over the coming quarters,\" he added. Virgin Australia chief executive Jayne Hrdlicka said on Monday that she would take several weeks of leave to spend time with family after the death of her husband from cancer. In an email drafted before her departure that accompanied Cotton's, she said the payments to staff and shareholders reflected the \"monumental feat\" of returning the airline to profitability for the first time in more than a decade. Bain Capital bought Virgin Australia in 2020 after it was placed in voluntary administration."

By 1:10pm AEST, the benchmark ASX 200 was down 0.2% to 7,253 points. The Australian dollar was steady at 67.6 US cents. US consumer price inflation figures (for the month of April) will be released at 10.30pm AEST. Economists expect the headline CPI to hold steady at an annual 5% and core CPI to moderate very slightly to 5.5%. But if inflation turns out to be sticky (or higher than those estimates), it would conflict with market bets that US rates will fall. Meanwhile, US President Joe Biden and top lawmakers failed to break a deadlock over raising the $US31.4 trillion debt limit, but vowed to meet again with just weeks before the country may be forced into an unprecedented default."

In a statement, the company said it was due to \"failure to comply with reasonable Board directions\". Bubs said it had also fired its former executive chairman Dennis Lin. This is the reason the company provided for this extraordinary move: “Noting the recent deterioration in Bubs’ financial performance over the half year, the non-executive directors considered the time was right for a change in leadership and to change the governance framework of the company to ensure that it aligns with ASX corporate governance principles and best practice.\" Sacking coincides with poor financial performance What's also extaordinary is that the Bubs board of directors did not bother to hide their negativity towards their co-founder and former chairman. Normally, when a top executive is forced to quit, the business would claim they \"resigned\" due to health problems, or a desire to \"spend more time with their family\". Last year, Bubs' share price surged when the United States was experiencing an extreme shortage of baby formula. The company exported large quantities of its product to the US, and was personally thanked by President Joe Biden at a virtual roundtable of infant formula manufacturers from across the world. But since the year began, its share price has collapsed by 50%. In February, Bubs Australia reported a half-year loss of $44 million. (It was a huge downgrade compared to the $702,000 half-year loss it announced the year before). The company announced Katrina Rathie as its new chairwoman last month, while Richard Paine will act as interim CEO until a permanent replacement is found."

                  "articleBody": "Economist David Bassanese of Betashares says the \"unambiguously expansionary\" budget will fuel pressure for the Reserve Bank of Australia to lift rates - as it continues it's fight against inflation. With growth domestic product (GDP) - the value of all goods and services produced in a given period - set to lift about 1.5% over the next two years, he says that means... \"This adds to the risk that the RBA will feel the need to raise interest rates at least once and possibly twice more in the coming months\". If that comes to pass, the around one-third of Australians who are currently paying off a mortgage would be hit with higher repayments. Despite a review of the RBA calling on the central bank to give equal priority to the concepts of full employment and steady inflation between 2-3%, the bank's recent decisions have confirmed it is on a mission to lower inflation at the cost of higher unemployment. Mr Bassanese praises the budget... \"The Budget is admirable in that most of the extra budget bounty from a resilient economy and higher export commodity prices is being saved rather than spent (unlike, say, during the commodity boom under then Treasurer Peter Costello). It’s also hard to argue over the areas in which money has been spent – mainly helping the least well off in the community\" But says it should have gone harder. \"(It) again makes no real effort to tighten the budget to support monetary policy in helping to rein in inflation and tackle Australia’s now ingrained structural budget deficit. The disappointment is not that the Government has attempted to support some of the less well-off in the community, but rather that greater effort was not made at a still relatively early stage in the electoral cycle to introduce tougher measures elsewhere in the economy.\""

                  "headline": "Multinationals to pay a minimum 15% tax in budget hit",
                  "articleBody": "Crack out the world's smallest violin to play a sad song for multinational corporations that have boosted their profit by billions through shifting it around the world ... and might not be able to do so as easily in future. My colleague, Nassim Khadem, has covered this issue for years — check out her explainer at the bottom of this post. The key issue is some multinational companies shift profits from countries with higher corporate tax rates like Australia (25-30%) to places like Singapore (17%) or the Cayman Islands (0%). It's expensive, complicated and contentious. But legal. Change is coming Treasuries around the world have gotten wise and have slowly been working together to make it harder. (Even though, at the same time, people have been working on the opposite side and trying to get around the new laws). Liam Delahunty, partner at consulting firm RSM Australia, noted new \"global minimum tax\" reforms for multinationals. This is the next phase of tax reform around the world and installs a minimum tax rate of 15 per cent. \"Australia is one of 135 countries and jurisdictions collaborating on global measures to tackle tax avoidance through  the OECD’s BEPS two-pillar reform plan – so the global minimum tax reforms are neither new nor unexpected\" But what is new, Mr Delahunty said, is the speed. \"There are firm start dates which don’t allow for any significant transition time and also come on the back of changes to thin capitalisation rules and intangible assets – both of which are due to commence from income years commencing on or after 1 July 2023, but are yet to be legislated.\" What this means is the 15 per cent global minimum tax for large multinational enterprises will kick in from 1 January 2024. There are only \"very modest revenue projections\" from the measures, so the government doesn't foresee a bounty of riches coming from it. But it may stop the money-shuffle, and see more of it land here in Australia where the profits are being made."

                  "articleBody": "We have a big update on Latitude's cyberattack. Regulators across Australia and New Zealand are now investigating the financial service company's customer data retention policies and protection. Latitude was hit by a cyber-attack in March. At least 7.9 million Australian and NZ drivers licences were eventually confirmed as stolen, and 6.1 million customer records. Some of the customer data stolen was provided before 2013 — including some dating back to 2005. It included information from before Latitude was Latitude, and was instead an entity under GE Money. Now, the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC) and the New Zealand Office of the Privacy Commissioner (OPC) have commenced a joint investigation into the company's personal information handling practices. In joint statement they said: The OAIC investigation will focus on whether Latitude took reasonable steps to protect the personal information they held from misuse, interference, loss, unauthorised access, modification or disclosure. The investigation will also consider whether Latitude took reasonable steps to destroy or de-identify personal information that was no longer required. If the investigation finds serious and/or repeated interferences with privacy in contravention of Australian privacy law, then the Commissioner has the power to seek civil penalties through the Federal Court of up to $50 million for each contravention. Six entities under Latitude are being investigated. The company has a range of services, including pay-day lending, buy now pay later services with retailers, and insurance across Australia and NZ. We have contacted the company for comment. Send our journalist an email on terzon.emilia@abc.net.au if you are a Latitude customer who is worried about your data."

So if your business tax bill was due between 31 December 2019 and 29 February 2022 and you still haven't paid it, the ATO won't fine you if you lodge your taxes by the end of this year. But that only applies to small businesses with yearly turnover of less than $10 million. The government is also offering tax rebates for investments in 'electrification' (say, if they bought heat pumps, battery storage, induction, and energy efficient fridges).

If you're not — say you've been late with paying your bills or defaulted on a mortgage — you'll pay a higher interest rates on loans to take account of the fact you're more risky (for the lender) than other people. For nations, it's similar. Ratings agencies work out if you, a company or a nation are a 'good risk'. New comments from Fitch Ratings in the wake of the 2023 Australian federal budget are broadly supportive \"The return to a underlying cash surplus in the current fiscal year and clear improvement in the federal government's fiscal position over the budget's forecast horizon is supportive of Australia's 'AAA' sovereign rating,\" said Jeremy Zook, director, sovereigns, APAC at Fitch Ratings. \"Fiscal outcomes are stronger than what we expected when we last affirmed Australia's rating with a Stable outlook in December 2022.\" It also says the budget won't boost inflation. \"The government's decision to allow higher than expected revenue collection to flow through to improved budget outcomes by keeping spending relatively contained, points to a commitment to its fiscal strategy and is not likely to contribute to inflationary pressures in the economy. We think the budget assumptions are reasonable and commodity price assumptions remain modest compared to our forecasts. Still, downside risks persist given the weak global outlook, elevated inflation and high interest rates Mr Zook does see \"structural budget pressures\" over the medium-term and warns that risks to the rating could build with spending demands \"particularly the NDIS\"."

                  "articleBody": "Wall Street has posted moderate losses, and the negative sentiment is likely to weigh on Australian markets this morning. Investors traded more cautiously ahead of a meeting between US President Joe Biden, Republican House Speaker Kevin McCarthy and other congressional leaders at the White House on Tuesday (local time), to discuss the debt ceiling stand-off. The Dow Jones, S & P 500 and Nasdaq Composite fell by 0.2%, 0.5% and 0.6%, respectively. Markets are waiting to hear the outcome of a meeting on Tuesday (local time) between US President Joe Biden, Worries of a potential government default loom over Washington as early as June 1, if Congress does not act to resolve the deadlock. The Democratic president is calling on lawmakers to raise the federal government's self-imposed borrowing limit without conditions. But the Republican House speaker, Mr McCarthy, has said his chamber will not approve any deal that does not cut spending to address a growing budget deficit. Past debt ceiling fights have typically ended with a hastily arranged agreement in the final hours of negotiations, thus avoiding a default. In 2011, the scramble prompted a downgrade of the country's top-notch credit rating. Veterans of that battle warn the current situation is even riskier because political divides have widened. Economists warn a lengthy default could send the US economy into a deep recession with soaring unemployment, while destabilising the global financial system that's built on US bonds."

Cotton said Australia's second-biggest airline was days away from finalising a capital return. Investors led by US private equity firm Bain Capital will share a $730 million payment, according to Reuters, citing a source who was not authorised to speak publicly. It will be structured as a capital reduction rather than a dividend, with Bain Capital taking around 90% followed by Richard Branson's Virgin Group with 5% and the rest going to the remaining shareholders, the source added. A Virgin Australia spokesperson confirmed the contents of the internal email. A Bain Capital spokesperson declined to comment. The airline had sought up to $450 million of loans for the capital return, Reuters reported in March. The rewards to staff and shareholders come as Virgin Australia, the key domestic rival to Qantas, prepares for what is likely to be one of the country's biggest listings this year. \"I can also confirm the IPO planning is well advanced,\" Cotton said in the email to staff seen by Reuters. \"While there is still no date set and our ultimate window of opportunity will depend on market conditions, we are hopeful this process will progress over the coming quarters,\" he added. Virgin Australia chief executive Jayne Hrdlicka said on Monday that she would take several weeks of leave to spend time with family after the death of her husband from cancer. In an email drafted before her departure that accompanied Cotton's, she said the payments to staff and shareholders reflected the \"monumental feat\" of returning the airline to profitability for the first time in more than a decade. Bain Capital bought Virgin Australia in 2020 after it was placed in voluntary administration.",

In a statement, the company said it was due to \"failure to comply with reasonable Board directions\". Bubs said it had also fired its former executive chairman Dennis Lin. This is the reason the company provided for this extraordinary move: “Noting the recent deterioration in Bubs’ financial performance over the half year, the non-executive directors considered the time was right for a change in leadership and to change the governance framework of the company to ensure that it aligns with ASX corporate governance principles and best practice.\" Sacking coincides with poor financial performance What's also extaordinary is that the Bubs board of directors did not bother to hide their negativity towards their co-founder and former chairman. Normally, when a top executive is forced to quit, the business would claim they \"resigned\" due to health problems, or a desire to \"spend more time with their family\". Last year, Bubs' share price surged when the United States was experiencing an extreme shortage of baby formula. The company exported large quantities of its product to the US, and was personally thanked by President Joe Biden at a virtual roundtable of infant formula manufacturers from across the world. But since the year began, its share price has collapsed by 50%. In February, Bubs Australia reported a half-year loss of $44 million. (It was a huge downgrade compared to the $702,000 half-year loss it announced the year before). The company announced Katrina Rathie as its new chairwoman last month, while Richard Paine will act as interim CEO until a permanent replacement is found.",

My colleague, Nassim Khadem, has covered this issue for years — check out her explainer at the bottom of this post. The key issue is some multinational companies shift profits from countries with higher corporate tax rates like Australia (25-30%) to places like Singapore (17%) or the Cayman Islands (0%). It's expensive, complicated and contentious. But legal. Change is coming Treasuries around the world have gotten wise and have slowly been working together to make it harder. (Even though, at the same time, people have been working on the opposite side and trying to get around the new laws). Liam Delahunty, partner at consulting firm RSM Australia, noted new \"global minimum tax\" reforms for multinationals. This is the next phase of tax reform around the world and installs a minimum tax rate of 15 per cent. \"Australia is one of 135 countries and jurisdictions collaborating on global measures to tackle tax avoidance through  the OECD’s BEPS two-pillar reform plan – so the global minimum tax reforms are neither new nor unexpected\" But what is new, Mr Delahunty said, is the speed. \"There are firm start dates which don’t allow for any significant transition time and also come on the back of changes to thin capitalisation rules and intangible assets – both of which are due to commence from income years commencing on or after 1 July 2023, but are yet to be legislated.\" What this means is the 15 per cent global minimum tax for large multinational enterprises will kick in from 1 January 2024. There are only \"very modest revenue projections\" from the measures, so the government doesn't foresee a bounty of riches coming from it. But it may stop the money-shuffle, and see more of it land here in Australia where the profits are being made.",

Regulators across Australia and New Zealand are now investigating the financial service company's customer data retention policies and protection. Latitude was hit by a cyber-attack in March. At least 7.9 million Australian and NZ drivers licences were eventually confirmed as stolen, and 6.1 million customer records. Some of the customer data stolen was provided before 2013 — including some dating back to 2005. It included information from before Latitude was Latitude, and was instead an entity under GE Money. Now, the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC) and the New Zealand Office of the Privacy Commissioner (OPC) have commenced a joint investigation into the company's personal information handling practices. In joint statement they said: The OAIC investigation will focus on whether Latitude took reasonable steps to protect the personal information they held from misuse, interference, loss, unauthorised access, modification or disclosure. The investigation will also consider whether Latitude took reasonable steps to destroy or de-identify personal information that was no longer required. If the investigation finds serious and/or repeated interferences with privacy in contravention of Australian privacy law, then the Commissioner has the power to seek civil penalties through the Federal Court of up to $50 million for each contravention. Six entities under Latitude are being investigated. The company has a range of services, including pay-day lending, buy now pay later services with retailers, and insurance across Australia and NZ. We have contacted the company for comment. Send our journalist an email on terzon.emilia@abc.net.au if you are a Latitude customer who is worried about your data.",

If you're not — say you've been late with paying your bills or defaulted on a mortgage — you'll pay a higher interest rates on loans to take account of the fact you're more risky (for the lender) than other people. For nations, it's similar. Ratings agencies work out if you, a company or a nation are a 'good risk'. New comments from Fitch Ratings in the wake of the 2023 Australian federal budget are broadly supportive \"The return to a underlying cash surplus in the current fiscal year and clear improvement in the federal government's fiscal position over the budget's forecast horizon is supportive of Australia's 'AAA' sovereign rating,\" said Jeremy Zook, director, sovereigns, APAC at Fitch Ratings. \"Fiscal outcomes are stronger than what we expected when we last affirmed Australia's rating with a Stable outlook in December 2022.\" It also says the budget won't boost inflation. \"The government's decision to allow higher than expected revenue collection to flow through to improved budget outcomes by keeping spending relatively contained, points to a commitment to its fiscal strategy and is not likely to contribute to inflationary pressures in the economy. We think the budget assumptions are reasonable and commodity price assumptions remain modest compared to our forecasts. Still, downside risks persist given the weak global outlook, elevated inflation and high interest rates Mr Zook does see \"structural budget pressures\" over the medium-term and warns that risks to the rating could build with spending demands \"particularly the NDIS\".",

              "plaintext": "Planning for Virgin Australia's upcoming initial public offering (IPO) is \"well advanced\", chairman Ryan Cotton said on Wednesday in an internal email that also outlined bonus payments to the airline's shareholders and staff after a return to profit. Cotton said Australia's second-biggest airline was days away from finalising a capital return. Investors led by US private equity firm Bain Capital will share a $730 million payment, according to Reuters, citing a source who was not authorised to speak publicly. It will be structured as a capital reduction rather than a dividend, with Bain Capital taking around 90% followed by Richard Branson's Virgin Group with 5% and the rest going to the remaining shareholders, the source added. A Virgin Australia spokesperson confirmed the contents of the internal email. A Bain Capital spokesperson declined to comment. The airline had sought up to $450 million of loans for the capital return, Reuters reported in March. The rewards to staff and shareholders come as Virgin Australia, the key domestic rival to Qantas, prepares for what is likely to be one of the country's biggest listings this year. \"I can also confirm the IPO planning is well advanced,\" Cotton said in the email to staff seen by Reuters. \"While there is still no date set and our ultimate window of opportunity will depend on market conditions, we are hopeful this process will progress over the coming quarters,\" he added. Virgin Australia chief executive Jayne Hrdlicka said on Monday that she would take several weeks of leave to spend time with family after the death of her husband from cancer. In an email drafted before her departure that accompanied Cotton's, she said the payments to staff and shareholders reflected the \"monumental feat\" of returning the airline to profitability for the first time in more than a decade. Bain Capital bought Virgin Australia in 2020 after it was placed in voluntary administration.",
