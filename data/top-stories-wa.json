The airline will remove the expiry date on COVID travel credits (that were due to run out at the end of this year). Around $2 billion worth of COVID credits were issued when borders closed in March 2020 and flights were grounded. In June, Qantas said around $400 million in credits still had not been used. The changes mean Qantas travel credit customers can request a cash refund at any point and Jetstar credit can be used for travel indefinitely. In a video message to customers, CEO Alan Joyce said he knows the credit system was not as smooth as it should have been. \"While we've improved it recently, and extended the expiry date several times, people lost faith in the process. We hope this helps change that.\"",
