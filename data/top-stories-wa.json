US stocks rose as investors await next week's inflation numbers and the Federal Reserve's meeting on interest rates. The S & P 500 index put on 0.2 per cent, while the Dow Jones index was flat. The Australian dollar held onto yesterday's gains after the Reserve Bank raised interest rates, up 0.8 per cent to 66.70 US cents. Australian investors are awaiting today's economic growth figures for the March quarter. The market is forecasting that gross domestic product expanded by 0.3 per cent over the first few months of the year, a slowdown from the 0.5 per cent growth over the December quarter.",
