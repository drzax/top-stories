PwC used confidential information — collected from the government when the firm was advising it on developing international tax avoidance laws — to help global clients avoid tax. \"There has been significant exposure on this across the past few weeks,\" the pair wrote referring to the PwC matter. \"This latest news is an important development: we can no longer sit by and watch our profession be tarnished by the unethical actions of a few. The decision by Treasury underlines the gravity of the matter.\" On Wednesday Treasury referred the leaking of confidential tax briefings by PwC and its former head of international tax Peter Collins to the Australian Federal Police. In a statement, Treasury secretary Steven Kennedy said Mr Collins \"improperly used confidential Commonwealth information\", with emails tabled in parliament by the Tax Practitioners Board highlighting \"the significant extent of the unauthorised disclosure of confidential Commonwealth information and the wide range of individuals within PwC who were directly and indirectly privy to the confidential information\". He said in light of these recent revelations and the seriousness of this misconduct, the Treasury referred the matter to the Australian Federal Police to consider commencement of a criminal investigation. Speaking in parliament this morning, AFP national security deputy commissioner Ian McCartney revealed the investigation was currently into \"an individual in relation to their activities\" but warned if police \"identify any further people we believe may have committed an offence\" they may come under investigation. Finance Department secretary Jenny Wilkinson has told Senate estimates hearings in Canberra she considers the PwC tax leak to be an abuse of confidence and trust with the federal government. Parliament has heard 53 current and former PwC partners and staff received emails revealing confidential tax information. PwC has now agreed to an order to \"stand down\" any staff who knew about Treasury tax leaks from working on any existing or future government contracts. KPMG's email to its staff said they were often \"trusted with confidential information\" and \"acknowledged that as a firm we have not got everything right\", referencing the firm's cheating scandal and the behaviour of partners relating to a controversial NSW transport entity but said that they had worked to \"put it right\" in the aftermath of the issues. \"At our firm, we recognise it is a privilege to support our clients in a commercial capacity or advisory role,\" the pair wrote. \"We are often trusted with confidential information as part of our interaction with clients. And with 10,000 people working on complex and high-profile projects, there may be cases where we fall short of what is expected.\" They said when they learned of the TPB findings, they \"fully appreciated the seriousness of these wrongdoings and the potential impact on all professional services firms\".",

Treasury Wine Estate shares fell 5.88 per cent after chief executive Tim Ford said sales would be down overall across the group by 2 to 3 per cent. Silicon Valley Bank owner First Citizens Bank says it will cut 3 per cent of its workforce, after its collapse earlier this year. The bank, which has been described as once \"the hearts and lungs\" of lending in Silicon Valley, was taken over by First Citizens, a North Carolina lender. The bank was one of many US regional banks to face pressure and was left with big debts when the Federal Reserve raised interest rates earlier in the year. However, the acquiring bank has now announced layoffs, with about 500 positions, or 3 per cent of its workforce, set to be eliminated. First Citizens Bank chief executive Frank Holding said these job cuts would primarily affect 'select' corporate roles.",

The Bank of Korea board voted to keep its policy rate unchanged at 3.50 per cent, as both inflation and economic growth eased. The central bank started raising interest rates in August 2021 to tame inflation, well before the world's other major central banks, and had raised them by a total of 300 basis points through January this year. Capital Economics senior Asia economist Gareth Leather said: \"we don't think it will be long before the [Korea's] central bank starts cutting interest rates\". \"With inflation falling back, the economy struggling and the housing market downturn deepening, we think the BoK will start loosening monetary policy in August, earlier than when others are expecting. \" \"The main reason we think the central bank will start loosening policy soon is the weakness of the economy. GDP grew by just 0.3 per cent in Q1 following a 0.4 per cent contraction in the final quarter of last year. He said pressures were also continuing to ease. \"The headline rate has fallen from a peak of 6.3 per cent in July 2022 to 3.7 per cent in March, which is the lowest reading in over a year.\" \"Overall, we are expecting 75 basis points worth of rate cuts this year, with the first cut likely to be in August.\" He noted that in contrast, most other analysts are expecting either very modest cuts, or for interest rates to be left unchanged this year.",
