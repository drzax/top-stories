Let's take a look at what is happening in each state now: NSW An emergency warning is still in place for Coolagolite Road at Coolagolite in the Bega Valley LGA and Allandale Street at Kearsley in the Cessnock LGA The RFS says it's too late for people in Bermagui, Barragga Bay and Cuttagee to leave, and is advising people in those townships to take shelter An evacuation centre for residents affected by the Allandale Street fire open at East Cessnock Bowling Club and Cessnock Showground is open for livestock. A Watch and Act warning is still in place for Gap Creek Lookout Road at Martinsville in the Lake Macquarie LGA. Victoria In Victoria many fire warnings have been downgraded as rain has started to fall. But this now means there are flood warnings in place. There is now an Advice level warning in place for fires burning at Loch Sport and Seacombe, which means there is currently no immediate threat but the situation could change again. There is also Advice level warnings in place for riverine flooding along: The Yarra River downstream of Coldstream The Goulburn River downstream of Seymour The Murray River to Tocumwal There is a Watch and Act (Prepare to Evacuate) warning due to bushfires for Culloden, Moornapa, Cobbannah, Fernbank, Glenaladale, Iguana Creek, Stockdale, Walpa, Woodglen and Lindenow South. Tasmania The fire on Flinders Island is now at Advice level The Tasmania Fire Service is urging residents to stay up to date with the latest information More than 13 millimetres of rain helped efforts to contain a bushfire at Mt Tanner, which has threatened residents in Pine Scrub and Leeka No properties have been directly impacted by the fire, however one caravan and two water tanks have been destroyed For the latest warnings, visit the ABC Emergency website.

AusNet spokesperson Nicci de Ryk told ABC Statewide Drive the power in most homes will be restored by 10pm AEDT tonight. “We've been able to gain access to those impacted areas and we now know the issues we're dealing with,” she said. \"There's seven poles that have been affected in the region — three poles completely burnt down, four significantly charred, in addition to some wires down.\" She said around 26 homes will remain disconnected. “We’ve got crews going in in the morning to do that permanent fix work, replacing those impacted poles. They are anticipating they’ll have that resolved and move from generator to the existing network structure by the end of tomorrow,” she said. “Broadly, that's the plan to come off generators at some stage once those poles have been rectified.”",
