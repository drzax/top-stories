Singtel — the company that owns Optus — released its half-yearly results to the Singapore stock exchange today. It says the Australian telco's operating revenue was up by 1 per cent over the six-month period. Optus also added 167,000 new mobile customers in this time. According to Singtel's press release, an increase of 108,000 new prepaid mobile customers was driven by a strong performance by Amaysim — that's a mobile phone provider that operates on the Optus network. A press release posted to Singtel's financial results page features this quote from Optus chief executive Kelly Bayer Rosmarin: \"Our customer-centric approach continues to drive positive engagement. \"We will continue to work to delight customers who are looking for value, innovation and a great network experience.\" However, it's important to note that these figures are based on results for the six months until September 30. So these results don't take into account yesterday's situation.",

United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) representative, Dominic Allen delivered the numbers during a press conference in Ramallah in the West Bank, joined by Palestinian Health Ministry Mai al-Kaila. \"I would also like to pay respect and condolences to the over 10,000 lives that have been lost,\" Mr Allen said \"That includes the 192 healthcare workers in Gaza and 89 UNRWA staff. It is the highest loss of life in the United Nations in one operation in our history. \"Now, what we've seen through the last month, is more than a humanitarian crisis, it is a catastrophe. \"And for UNFPA, we are deeply concerned for the 1.1 million women and girls in Gaza right now.\" He added that the key message from the UN is wanting a ceasefire, with WHO representative Richard Peeperkorn echoing the calls. Meanwhile, Ms al-Kaila called for \"an immediate stop to the Israeli aggression on the Gaza Strip, and the West Bank\" and for aid to be allowed through. \"Especially fuel, to operate generators in the hospitals, and this should be urgently done and immediately, as well as allowing the access of voluntary medical teams to support the medical teams in treatment of those injured,\" she said \"Allowing the exit of patients and injured residents to get treatment in Egypt hospitals and other countries without any hindrance. \"The cease of displacement of people from their homes, and their neighbourhoods in Gaza. \"All these demands are fair ones, and urgent demands to rescue those who can be rescued in the Gaza Strip.\"",

                "plaintext": "Israel's military spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari has claimed that Hamas has lost control of northern Gaza as thousands of residents have moved south. \"We saw 50,000 Gazans move from the northern Gaza Strip to the south,\" Rear Admiral Hagari said in a televised briefing. \"They are moving because they understand that Hamas has lost control in the north, and that the south is safer. \"A safer area, where they receive medicine, water and food. They understand it's an improvement.\" Mr Hagari added that there would be no ceasefire but Israel has been allowing for humanitarian pauses at specific times to give residents an opportunity to relocate south. Meanwhile, Hamas says its fighters had inflicted heavy losses, with the armed wing on Wednesday releasing a video that appeared to show intense street battles alongside bombed-out buildings in Gaza City. Israeli tanks have met heavy resistance from fighters using underground tunnels to stage ambushes, according to sources with Hamas and the separate Islamic Jihad militant group. One clip from the Hamas video released on Wednesday showed fighters running past piles of debris and stopping to fire shoulder-propelled missiles at Israeli tanks. Another showed them shooting rifles from perches behind buildings and dumpsters. Reuters was not able to authenticate the footage. Saleh al-Arouri, an exiled Hamas commander, told Hamas-affiliated Al-Aqsa TV that Israeli forces may gain control of some areas in Gaza. \"But that will not stop the resistance's fight against soldiers and tanks. The more (Israel) spreads and expands on the ground, the deeper its losses will become\", he said. Reuters",

The company said in a media release that mobile service revenue grew 3.4 per cent, with an increase in consumer preferences for lower priced prepaid offerings. This growth resulted from customer acquisition, higher postpaid ARPU as well as increased revenue from Optus' successful broadcast of the FIFA Women's World. In the first half, total mobile customer base grew 167,000, with 108,000 new prepaid mobile customers driven by a strong performance by amaysim. However, its operating expenses were up 3.4 per cent, reflecting higher costs of goods sold and content costs, as well as inflationary pressure on expenses, especially energy costs. As a result, the telco's earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) declined 3.2 per cent whilst revenue minus expenses excluding tax and interest (EBIT) — a key indicator of profitability — declined 14 per cent. \"Optus has made continued progress in delivering its strategy, despite challenging market conditions including weak consumer sentiment and inflationary pressures that have resulted in pressure on operating expenses,\" said Optus CEO Kelly Bayer Rosmarin. \"Our customer-centric approach has continued to drive positive engagement. However, we recognise that yesterday's outage has let down our customers and for that we are truly sorry. We will continue to work even harder to retain our customers trust and to deliver great network experience, good value, and continued innovation.\"",
