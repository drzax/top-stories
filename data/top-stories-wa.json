Over the past year, new housing lending is down by 20.5% — but the Commonwealth Bank notes that turnaround in recent months has had a direct impact on house prices. Here's some of what they said in their note this afternoon: \"The turnaround in lending the last three months has helped boost the recovery in home prices over the same time period. The RBA is watching this development closely, noting in the June Board Minutes \"stabilisation in housing loan approvals suggested that financial conditions may not have been as tight as they had previously judged.\" \"To the detail in May and the lift higher in home lending was driven by all three categories with owner occupier ex first home buyer (+3.5%), investor (+6.2%) and first home buyer (+5.5%) all rising. \"First home buyers are likely responding to a number of forces. Rental shortages and rising rents are likely seeing first home buyers take the plunge and purchase. There are also a number of federal and state government programs in place to help this cohort enter the housing market. \"Over the past year lending to first home buyers is down 15.1% compared to owner occupiers ex first home buyers (21.8%) and investors (20.9%). \"External refinancing rose by a large 8.1% in May and was 22.4% higher compared to a year ago. The rapid increase in interest rates has led to a large number of mortgage holders seeking out a better deal and there are limited signs to show this is abating. \"The fixed rate roll off currently underway will also be incentivising refinancing as borrowers look for lower variable rates to move to after their fixed rate expires.\" CBA also noted that owner‑occupier refinancing reached a record high in May.",
