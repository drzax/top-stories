Eric Lewis, who had been chosen to officiate the finals in each of the last four NBA seasons, was not selected as one of the 12 referees for this year's finals.

The 80-year-old got up quickly and walked back to his seat, and the White House says he's \"totally fine\". After Biden was helped up, he pointed behind him, seeming to indicate what he tripped over. He mingled with other officials afterward, smiling and giving a \"thumbs up\" sign. The whole moment was caught on video: White House communications director Ben LaBolt says on Twitter that Biden is fine. \"There was a sandbag on stage while he was shaking hands,\" he says. Former president Donald Trump, was asked about Biden's fall soon after and said, \"He actually fell down? Well I hope he wasn't hurt.\" Trump, who is running for president again in 2024, added \"you gotta be careful about that\", even if you have to \"tip-toe down a ramp\".",

              "plaintext": "Good morning, welcome to another day of market action. There was certainly some sighs of relief overnight on US markets after the House of Representatives passed the debt ceiling deal struck between President Joe Biden and congressional republicans led by Speaker Kevin McCarthy. The deal suspends the debt ceiling until January 1, 2025, in returns for some limits on spending that are estimated to save around $US1.5 trillion over a decade according to the Congressional Budget Office. That deal now looks likely to sail through the Senate, given the US government some breathing space before it threatens to run out of the ability to borrow money again at some point within the next couple of years. Some key economic data was also viewed positively in light of the upbeat sentiment from the debt deal. Private employment data stayed strong and jobless claims remained low but, despite this, wage increases in the US moderated, raising optimism that the Fed can skip a rate rise this month and may even be finished hiking. \"Unit labor cost data for the first quarter normally doesn't trigger a reaction. But it signaled a significant improvement,\" Edward Moya, senior market analyst at OANDA in New York, told Reuters. \"The market became confident that, 'wow the Fed rate hike for June is pretty much not happening ' and confidence is falling for raising rates for July.\" US manufacturing data, including around input costs, was also weak, further adding to the case that price pressures in the economy are easing. Futures are now pricing in a more than three-quarters chance of the Federal Reserve keeping rates on hold when it meets in a couple of weeks. The benchmark S & P 500 index rose 1% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq 1.3%, with both reaching nine-month highs, while the blue chip Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.5% to 33,062 points. Stay with me to see how the Australian share market reacts later this morning.",
