Being an invite-only lunch, the briefing is not flagged on the \"coming up\" section of the RBA website. How do I know about it? Only because I am on the AICC mailing list. Mr Lowe defended his appearance at the Barrenjoey lunch, saying nothing untoward occurred and telling a parliamentary committee \"I can't live in a bubble\". Mr Lowe told that committee that the bank would extend blackout periods to ensure that he didn't make such appearances between rates decisions and major policy statements from the RBA. That will not be the case this week, and Mr Lowe will deliver an address open to the media tomorrow morning at the Morgan Stanley Australia Summit, which the ABC will cover. The RBA does hold regular background and off the record conversations with market participants and the media, including the ABC. However, appearances at closed \"members only\" events are perhaps a poor look after a major review into the bank urged greater public transparency around its decision-making.",
