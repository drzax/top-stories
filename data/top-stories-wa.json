The narrow strip of land has no access to the outside word except through Israel, which controls most of its land and sea boundaries, and Egypt, which shares a border to the south. Israel has enforced a blockade on Gaza since the Hamas terrorist organisation took control of the territory in 2007, imposing curbs on exports and imports, and restricting who can enter and leave. During a briefing to parliament's Foreign Affairs and Defence Committee, Gallant said the first stage of Israel's military operation is meant to destroy Hamas's infrastructure. He said the intermediate phase would include \"operations at lower intensity\" eliminating \"pockets of resistance\". \"The third phase will require the removal of Israel's responsibility for life in the Gaza Strip, and the establishment of a new security reality for the citizens of Israel,\" Gallant said, according to a statement from his office.

Mrs Carbone, 66, was born and raised in Sydney before her family moved to Israel when she was in her teens. She was murdered by Hamas terrorists outside her home in Be'eri Kibbutz, about five kilometres from the Gaza border. Her three children Nicole, Tom and Maya, were surrounded by friends and family as their mother was laid to rest after an emotional service. Mrs Carbone was described as a peaceful and kind woman, who loved books and music. Her daughter, Maya Carbone, told mourners her mother was someone who believed in goodness and beauty. \"You were always full of love, of helping, of nonchalance and of giving,\" she said. \"You taught us to look at the world with wonder and you taught us values. \"You pushed us to be independent and reminded us to be ourselves. \"Mum, who knows how one summarizes the life of someone? I miss you so much and I'm so sad that sometimes there is no place for words.\" Mrs Carbone's brother, Danny Majzner, was also in the Kibbutz when it was stormed by Hamas gunmen. He told the ABC's Middle East Correspondent Allyson Horn of the moment he lost contact with his sister. \"She called me at 12:09, midday Saturday, five hours after it started and she was whispering, she says 'I hear them, they're here. I can't remember if I locked the door',\" he said. \"And I said 'ok sis, be cool, be calm, you're in the safety room, just try and hold the handle from the inside and we'll be alright, you know. But let's hang up because we don't want to let them hear us talking.' \"And that was it. I haven't heard from her since.\" The family didn't find out until three days later that she had been killed, along with more than 100 others from her community. Mrs Carbone's family said it hoped to one day return her body to a cemetery in the Kibbutz where she lived, and died.",
