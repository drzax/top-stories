The Australian lender falsely indicated to customers that they could rely on a 'cash advance' from funds stated to be their 'Available Funds' without incurring fees and interest. The error resulted in customers being charged with thousands of dollars in fees while the average remediation paid was around $45 per affected account, according to the Australian Securities & Investments Commission (ASIC) — the regulator which sued ANZ. \"Many ANZ customers relied on the account information displayed by the bank and were charged fees that were inconsistent with that information,\" said ASIC deputy chair Sarah Court.

In a separate statement, the lender acknowledged the breach and agreed to further remediation for the period from November 2018 to September 2021. \"ANZ accepts responsibility for what has occurred and apologises to its customers, and has addressed the issues that gave rise to the contraventions,\" the lender said.",

The leader on the ASX today is medical imaging company Pro Medicus after securing a $140 million, 10-year contract with the largest not-for-profit healthcare system in Texas, Baylor Scott & White Health. Its shares jumped 9.3 per cent at the open, but have pared back a little to 9 per cent — to be valued at $77.62 a share, shortly after 11am AEST. Pro Medicus will supply cloud-engineered imaging services, starting in the first quarter of 2024. \"Baylor Scott & White Health joins our impressive list of IDN and Tier 1 academic clients and represents our first major client in Texas.\" Dr Sam Hupert, the chief executive of Pro Medicus, told the market: \"The scale and scope of our initiative with Baylor Scott & White Health is noteworthy and will include nearly 500 radiologists who will be exposed to the benefits of Visage 7.\"",
