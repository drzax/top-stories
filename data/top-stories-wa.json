While thousands of people have died in southern Israel and the Gaza Strip since Hamas's October 7 attacks, recent violence in the north has also claimed lives — two in Israel and at least 11 in Lebanon. Since the Hamas attacks, \"everything has changed,\" said evacuated kibbutz member Lea Raivitz, 68, still stunned by the onslaught. One day after the shock attack, her kibbutz Bar'am, located right by the Lebanese border, moved out with all its people — from newborns to those aged in their 90s — in only its second evacuation since it was founded in 1949. \"It's shaken all of our beliefs,\" Raivitz told AFP, speaking at their temporary new home, a hotel in Tiberias on the western shores of the Sea of Galilee. Communities within 2 kilometres of the Lebanese border were evacuated to state-funded guesthouses on Monday. The Israel-Lebanon border area has remained largely at peace since a devastating war in 2006 between Israel and Hezbollah. Residents of kibbutz Bar'am who have lived there for decades say that unrest over the years has come in cycles, and they are used to seeing Hezbollah posts and flags from their homes on the other side of the border. But some told AFP that their sense of security had been all but shattered following the October 7 rampage by Hamas, the worst attack in the country's history. \"We're all traumatised, we're all scared,\" said kibbutz resident Angela Yantian, 67. \"I didn't think that sort of thing could have ever happened.\" Some kibbutzniks said Israel's sacrifice and the fight ahead are worth it if they bring greater security for Israel in the future. \"Every terror organisation needs to know that we will deal with them when the time is right for us,\" said Tsachi Shaked, 51. \"If the right time is now, then we will need to do it now.\" AFP",

Gaza normally gets its water supplies from a combination of sources, including a pipeline from Israel, desalination plants on the Mediterranean Sea and wells. Those supplies were slashed when Israel cut off water, along with the fuel and electricity that run water and sewage plants, in the wake of the Hamas attacks. The United Nations recognises access to water as a human right. Dehydration can cause dizziness, fatigue and confusion and in severe cases lead to organ failure and death, with children, the elderly and those with health conditions particularly vulnerable. Water access is also crucial for sanitation, and a lack of clean water can lead to the spread of infections like cholera and dysentery. Diarrhoeal diseases that can be spread by unclean water are the leading cause of death for children under the age of five across the world, said Dr Tsion Firew, an emergency physician at Columbia University who has worked on water access in humanitarian settings. Healthcare settings are a particular concern as they rely on clean water to care for patients who are sick and injured. As hospitals across the Gaza Strip struggle to care for thousands of patients, the World Health Organization said the lack of water is putting lives in danger. \"Water is needed to ensure sanitary conditions on inpatient wards, in operation rooms, and emergency departments. It is essential for the prevention of hospital-associated infections and for the prevention of outbreaks in hospitals,\" it said in a statement. AP",

Only four countries of the 15 UNSC members joined Russia in voting for the resolution. Four countries, including the United States, voted against it. Six countries abstained. Russia's UN ambassador, Vassily Nebenzia, had urged support for the resolution to respond to the \"unprecedented exacerbation\" of the situation, citing the council's inaction since the October 7 attack by Hamas. A vote on a rival resolution from Brazil that would condemn the Hamas attack was delayed. The Russian draft resolution would have called for \"an immediate, durable and fully respected humanitarian cease-fire\" and \"strongly condemns all violence and hostilities directed against civilians and all acts of terrorism\". The Brazilian draft resolution calls for \"humanitarian pauses\" and also \"firmly condemns all violence and hostilities against civilians and all acts of terrorism\". But it also \"unequivocally rejects and condemns the heinous terrorist attacks by Hamas\". AP",
