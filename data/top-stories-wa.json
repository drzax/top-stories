They've just published some findings from a survey they did of borrowers back in June. It reveals 69 per cent of borrowers with a fixed mortgage rate don't know what their new rate will be when it inevitably rolls over to variable. Some people fixed their interest rate (back when the Reserve Bank of Australia's cash rate was 0.1 per cent ) with their lender at extremely low levels - under or about 2 per cent. Now the RBA's official cash rate is 4.1 per cent, those fixed mortgages will are starting to expire and will be put on their lender's current variable rate - many of which start with a 5. That will be quite the shock to some borrowers. The AMP survey of 1,000 people also found a quarter didn't know when their fixed rate was due to expire. About 880,000 fixed rate mortgages are rolling off their rates this year. AMP says the research shows some people lack understanding of key aspects of their home loan. Sean O'Malley, Group Executive AMP Bank said: \"AMP Bank's latest research has found there are many Australian homeowners who could be more engaged with their mortgages. Not knowing about key aspects of their home loan or how it works, could be costing them in the long run. \"Your home loan is probably the biggest financial commitment you'll make in your lifetime. Making some simple changes, for example maximising the benefits of an offset account can help you pay off your home loan sooner. \"It's a reminder of the importance of checking in on your finances and making sure your home loan is fit for purpose. I encourage all homeowners take the time to understand key features and terminology of their loan, and to ask your broker or lender if you're not sure.\"",

So, how much of our energy needs are being met by renewable sources? Daniel Westerman, who is the boss of the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO), told ABC's AM program it fluctuates. \"In fact in the National Electricity Market, we've experienced times of up to 68% of our power fed by renewable energy. \"On average, though, throughout the year, it's about a third. The remaining two thirds ... is powered by these old coal fired power stations. \"That really does signal the transition that over the next decade, we expect a significant number to retire to be replaced by the cheapest form of new build energy, which is renewable energy backed up by storage and connected with transmission. \"The challenge for us is to make sure that those new projects get and built in a timely fashion.\"",
