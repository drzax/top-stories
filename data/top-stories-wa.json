After having announced Michele Bullock as the new Reserve Bank governor just over a week ago, he has now appointed Victorian public servant Chris Barrett as the next chair of the Productivity Commission. \"Cabinet has agreed to recommend to the Governor-General that Chris Barrett be appointed the chair of the Productivity Commission for a term of five years,\" Jim Chalmers told a press conference. \"Chris's appointment recognises if we want to build a stronger economy, then we've got to build stronger economic institutions and that means renewing and refocussing and revitalising the Productivity Commission.\" Mr Barrett is currently the deputy of the economic division of the Victorian department of Treasury and Finance, with almost three decades experience working on public policy. Previously, he also served as Australia's ambassador to the OECD, executive director of the European Climate Foundation, and as chief of staff to former federal treasurer Wayne Swan, whom Mr Chalmers also worked for. \"His appointment comes after a rigorous merit based process which involved interviews with two departmental secretaries and the Australian Public Service commissioner,\" Mr Chalmers added. Mr Chalmers said Mr Barrett will start his new role in September, and thanked the outgoing chair, Michael Brennan. \"He has made a significant contribution to that institution and to the national economic debate,\" he said. \"And I'm grateful for that and for his time before that as a senior public servant and a ministerial advisor as well. \"Under Mr Brennan's leadership, the Productivity Commission has delivered more than 20 reports to the government.\"",

              "plaintext": "I flagged this earlier, and it's by far the most important economic event penciled in for Australia this week. On Wednesday at precisely 11:30am AEST the Australian Bureau of Statistics will release the June quarter Consumer Price Index (CPI). The typical market forecast is for headline quarterly inflation of 1% and annual at 6.2%, down from 1.4% and 7% respectively in the March quarter. The critical 'core' trimmed mean figure for inflation, most closely watched by the RBA because it strips out the most volatile price moves, is generally tipped to drop to 1.1% and 6% for the quarter and year, respectively, according to a Refinitiv survey of economists. Westpac senior economist Justin Smirk released the bank's CPI forecast late last week. It's worth reading because it breaks down each major category and goes into detail about why Westpac is tipping the number it is. The forecast has also generally been pretty close to the mark quite often. Westpac's headline forecast is 1.1% for the quarter and 6.3% for the year to June, which is a touch above the market consensus, but it's core inflation forecast is on the average. \"The Monthly CPI Indicator is turning out to be a very helpful guide to the components of the CPI and we have used the data from the April and May surveys to fine tune our forecasts,\" Mr Smirk wrote. \"Despite the additional information provided by the Monthly CPI Indicator, there are still many significant unknowns we have to estimate.\" Having crunched those numbers, Westpac expects electricity subsidies to push down utility prices by 1.2% over the quarter, with holiday travel costs falling 2%, putting downward pressure on CPI. Healthcare costs are also expected to fall 1.1% as households hit their spending threshold to received government subsidies, while education is likely to be flat after huge price hikes in the March quarter. On the flip side, fruit and vegetables (+2.8%), rents (+2.4%) and financial and insurance services (+2.5%) are all tipped to have seen steeper price rises over the three months to June than over the first quarter of the year. \"Overall, the June quarter CPI is set to confirm that inflationary pressures peaked in late 2022 and continue to moderate as we move through 2023,\" Mr Smirk tipped. \"However, it will also continue to highlight that core inflation remains significantly above the top of the RBA's target band and is not likely to return to being within the band any time soon.\" Westpac is currently expecting the RBA to leave rates on hold at 4.1% when it meets next week, but says it will be another finely balanced decision.",
