Coronado's quarterly group saleable production is up 22% compared to its March quarter to 4.5 million tonnes, while its group run of mine (ROM) coal production was 15% higher to 7.2 million tonnes. Its revenue for the June quarter came in at $US728 million ($1 billion), with capital expenditure totalling $US48 million ($70.8 million). Although Coronado has flagged higher capital expenditure for the 2023 financial year, it's also expecting coking coal prices to remain well above the long-term average, and demand to continue to rise. Put that all together, and it makes sense why its share price is tracking up today â it's given investors something to be optimistic about.",
