But the Victorian Labor Party's rules actually state that when choosing a new leader, nominations are open for three days. They also state that someone who's in the running for the top job can't be the interim leader during that time. But state political reporter Bridget Rollason says she's hearing some Labor MPs are keen to override those rules today, so they can lock in a leader with a minimum of drama. \"We reckon the caucus can vote to overrule the party rules if there is only one nomination tomorrow to get it done,\" one senior Labor figure told her. So in short, we don't know for sure — nominations may run for a few days, or we could see a new Labor leader before dinner.",

The Dow posted its biggest one-day percentage drop since March, while all three major averages ended at their lowest closing levels in well over three months. Adding to investor anxiety was the potential of a partial US government shutdown by the weekend, which ratings agency Moody's warned would harm the country's credit. Benchmark 10-year Treasury yields have climbed to 16-year highs in the wake of the Federal Reserve's hawkish longer-term rate outlook last week. \"We continue to adjust to the higher interest rates,\" said Brad McMillan, chief investment officer for Commonwealth Financial Network. \"What you are getting is increasingly a sense that the market is overvalued. ... There's a real sense out there that this isn't sustainable, and buyers are being scared away.\" Amazon shares dropped 4 per cent as the US Federal Trade Commission filed a long awaited antitrust lawsuit against the online retailer. The case against Amazon, joined by 17 state attorneys-general, accuses the company of abusing its dominance as an online retailer to thwart competitors and harm sellers and customers that rely on its platform. The company vowed to fight the lawsuit, saying its practices have spurred competition and innovation.",
