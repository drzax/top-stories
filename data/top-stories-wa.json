It was the fifth-straight month property prices rose across Australia, with capital cities seeing stronger growth than regional areas, however CoreLogic noted that there had been a \"flow of new listings\" hitting the market. Sydney has seen a near 10% rise in fresh listings compared to this time last year, and 18% above its five-year average, CoreLogic's research director Tim Lawless said. \"An increased flow of new listings provides more choice and may be working to reduce some of the urgency felt among prospective buyers,\" he said. But the slowdown in the overall growth rate of property prices has been driven by a fall in premium housing markets, and Mr Lawless said that might be indicative of a wider weakness approaching the market in the coming months. \"With total stock levels still low and selling conditions reasonably strong, it may be the case that more home owners are picking current market conditions as a good time to sell, rather than waiting until spring when stock levels might be higher, creating more competition among vendors,\" he said. \"Another possibility is that we are seeing the first signs of motivated selling as the rapid rate-hiking cycle catches up with household balance sheets.\" You can read the full story from my colleague, business reporter Michael Janda below:",

Host Patricia Karvelas asked him whether he thought Australians could cope with another interest rate rise. Chalmers was wary of answering, maintaining that the central bank must act independently, but said that the fight against high inflation wasn't over despite it showing signs that it was moderating. \" Australians are under the pump. We are seeing the impact of the rate rises which are already in the system,\" he said. \"We are making welcome progress in the fight against inflation, but we're not there yet, and the Reserve Bank will weigh up the fact that inflation is moderating. \"We had a soft retail trade figure last week. \"They will weigh that all up in the usual way and they'll come to a decision whether rates go up or not.\" Karvelas pushed Chalmers for an answer on whether he thought Australians could handle a rate rise after today's meeting, to which he acknowledged the past rises were hurting people. \"Put it this way, Patricia, the rate rises which are already in the system have made life harder for people. I mean, that's self evident,\" he said. \"And, you know … I've said probably the last half a dozen times that you and I have spoken that we understand that whether it's inflation, which has been higher than we'd like for longer than we'd like, whether it is these interest rate rises over the last, since before the election last year, whether it's the global economic uncertainty, it's putting people under pressure and slowing our economy already, we're already seeing the impact of the rate rises, which are in the system. \"We're seeing that in a heap of data that we've been getting in the last few weeks or months. The Reserve Bank will weigh that up, and they'll come to a decision independently.\"",
