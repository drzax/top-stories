                "plaintext": "Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu has said his country does not seek to conquer, occupy or govern Gaza after its war against Hamas but a \"credible force\" would be needed to enter the Palestinian enclave if necessary to prevent the emergence of militant threats. Netanyahu's comments this week suggesting that Israel would be responsible for Gaza security indefinitely drew pushback from the United States, Israel's main ally, with Washington saying it would oppose Israeli post-war occupation of Gaza. \"We don't seek to conquer Gaza, we don't seek to occupy Gaza, and we don't seek to govern Gaza,\" Netanyau told Fox News. Netanyahu said a civilian government would need to take shape in Gaza but that Israel would make sure something like the October 7 attack does not happen again. \"So, we have to have a credible force that, if necessary, will enter Gaza and kill the killers. Because that's what will prevent the reemergence of a Hamas-like entity,\" Netanyahu said. US officials say the Palestinian Authority (PA), which has limited self-rule in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, should return to govern Gaza after the war. Hamas seized control of Gaza from the PA forces of President Mahmoud Abbas in 2007. Top Palestinian officials, including Abbas, say a PA return to Gaza must be accompanied by a political solution that ends Israel's occupation of territory it captured in the 1967 Middle East war. Netanyahu said that after the war, \"what we have to see is Gaza demilitarised, deradicalised and rebuilt\". Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh told PBS this week the PA would not return to Gaza \"on the back of an Israeli tank\". Reuters",

The group said it witnessed Israeli forces firing at the entrance of a hospital, shooting at an emergency unit and using military vehicles to block ambulances from entering hospitals. A paramedic was also shot while inside an ambulance, the charity said. \"Hospitals are not targets and must remain safe spaces. Medical care must not be impeded,\" Doctors Without Borders said on X. \"We call on the Israeli military to stop firing on hospitals and to stop their military vehicles from blocking ambulances and medical staff from reaching health care facilities.\" Israel's military has not released a response to these claims, but said on social media that it had conducted \"counterterrorism activity\" in the Jenin refugee camp and killed multiple terrorists.",

The country's second biggest bank said the 12 rate rises in just over a year helped deliver the results, describing it as a once in a lifetime opportunity. NAB's boss Ross McEwan acknowledged that mortgage stress is rising, but despite the rate hikes borrowers are handing it — for now. He sat down with Alicia Barry on The Business last night to discuss the results, and why he expects house prices will keep rising this year and into 2024. You can watch their full chat below:",

Optus says a rare technical issue was behind the outage, and has announced it's acknowledging the \"patience and loyalty\" of customers by giving them free data — but many consumers argue their losses are worth much more. The federal government has also announced an inquiry into the outage which impacted emergency services, transport networks and shut down business payments. Crisis PR expert Sally Branson says Optus' response may have done more damage to its reputation than the outage itself, and is surprised the telco doesn't grasp the scale of the problem — especially after last year's cyber attack. \"For all the great work that Optus does around sponsorship of the Matildas ... is so expensive to do, but it fails when the core business of providing communications falls down,\" she said. \"It's 2023, we don't expect CEOs to hide. \"There's cafes all over the country who are waiting on IOU's for their flat whites, and a bit of a data package thrown my way, I'd be pretty upset. \"If Optus' key messaging is they support Australian business, that needs to be more than data.\"",
