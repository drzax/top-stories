The falls are broad-based, with only the consumer non-cyclicals (such as supermarkets) and real estate sectors gaining any ground. Metcash has led the gains in the consumer non-cyclical sector, and across the top 200 firms as a whole, with the supplier to IGA grocers and owner of Mitre 10 and Home Timber and Hardware up 6.7% to $3.83 on its full-year results (its financial year runs to April 30). The company reported a 6.2% increase in revenue resulting in a 7.6% increase in statutory profit after tax to $259 million. The biggest losses were in the mining sector, with coal miners New Hope (-3.6%), Whitehaven (-2.2%) and Coronado (-2.2%) among those in the top ten biggest declines on the ASX 200 so far. The Australian dollar is at 66.8 US cents .",
