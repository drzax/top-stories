A key part of any AGM, like Qantas' today, is allowing shareholders to vote for or against the company's remuneration report, which is essentially asking investors whether they agree with the company's plans to compensate their executives. Under Australia's Corporations Act, if a company's shareholders vote more than 25% against the remuneration report, that's known as a \"first strike\". Then, if there is a second strike at the company's next AGM (that is, there is another vote against the report by more than 25% of shareholders next year) that means the board faces being spilled. If that happens, shareholders then vote to determine whether directors need to stand for re-election, which is known as a \"spill resolution\". If that passes, there needs to be a \"spill meeting\" held within 90 days, and that has its own set of rules. So what's happened with Qantas today is shareholders have delivered their first strike against the board — because 83% of shareholders who voted protested against the airline's remuneration report. The vote doesn't have an immediate effect, but it essentially puts the Qantas board on notice by shareholders to improve. It's a message that says if the airline doesn't turn things around by next year's AGM, they could face a second protest vote which could deliver a second strike — and that would mean the board could be facing a spill. As chair Richard Goyder said, the protest vote sends \"a very clear message from shareholders\".",

One citizen and one permanent resident were able to exit through the Rafah crossing out of Gaza during the second window for foreign nationals to evacuate on Thursday. The Australians, who were on a list to get out of Gaza in the first opportunity on Wednesday, made the crossing into Egypt with the help of consular officials from the UK. They will join the rest of the other 23 Australians who got out of Gaza safely on Wednesday for onward travel to Cairo. \"We continue to engage closely with partners in the region and do all we can to enable the remaining Australians in Gaza, who wish to leave, to do so as soon as possible,\" a foreign affairs department spokesman said. \"The timing of those departures depends on a range of factors. \"The situation in Gaza continues to be highly challenging and can change rapidly.\" More than 800 people have been able to leave Gaza via the Rafah crossing under a deal brokered between the US, Egypt, Israel and Qatar. A third crossing opportunity is expected to take place on Friday. Reporting with AAP",
