All the talk before the game was about how the Football Ferns could just about lock up a knockout spot with a win this afternoon, but suddenly the Philippines have thrown that into disarray. Sarina Bolden's goal was the result of near-perfect attacking play from Philippines, with Sara Eggesvik's cross put perfectly in her path and the leap and header was clean. New Zealand will be disappointed by the efforts of defenders CJ Bott and Rebekah Stott, while goalie Victoria Esson got both hands to it right in front of her face but couldn't handle. New Zealand beat Norway in their opener, and now if this game stays like this, the group is completely wide open. Especially if Norway beat Switzerland tonight, then every team in the group will be on one win each!",
