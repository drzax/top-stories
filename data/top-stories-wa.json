US Special Counsel Jack Smith's office has asked a judge to start the trial on January 2 in part due to the public's interest in a speedy trial. That date would have the trial get underway just two weeks before the first votes are cast in the 2024 Republican presidential primary, a race in which Trump is the frontrunner. Smith's office said interest was \"of particular significance here, where the defendant, a former president, is charged with conspiring to overturn the legitimate results of the 2020 presidential election, obstruct the certification of the election results, and discount citizens’ legitimate votes.\" A spokesperson for Trump says Smith and the Justice Department \"are blatantly playing political games\", citing Trump's status as a frontrunner in the 2024 election. Prosecutors predict it will take about four to six weeks to put forward the bulk of their case against Trump at trial. Trump last week pleaded not guilty to charges over the alleged election conspiracy.",
