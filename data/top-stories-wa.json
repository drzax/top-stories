The bank now expects a higher peak cash rate of 4.6 per cent and a delay to the first rate cut in 2024 from February to May. Westpac's previous forecast was growth of 1 per cent in 2023 to be followed by 1.5 per cent in 2024, based on a peak cash rate of 4.1 per cent. Westpac Chief Economist Bill Evans' now expects household consumption to grow by just 0.3 per cent in 2023 and 0.6 per cent in 2024. \"This consumption profile is consistent with the very weak measures of Consumer Sentiment we have seen since the onset of high inflation and rising interest rates in 2022,\" Mr Evans said. Mr Evans said the forecasts mean per capita spending recessions in both 2023 and 2024 of -1.5% in 2023 followed by -1.0% in 2024. It also implies GDP per capita recessions of -1.2% in 2023 and -0.6% in 2024. A per capita recession is when the economy continues to grow but living standards decline. \"Consumer spending prospects, in the face of high inflation and  sharply higher interest rates, would be even weaker were it not  for the substantial savings buffer that households accumulated  during the pandemic and the strong starting point for jobs,\" Mr Evans said. \"The  tightest labour market conditions in 50 years and still elevated  job vacancies are providing clear support to household incomes  and spending, but also give those households coming under  more intense financial pressure more scope to make adjustments.\"",

HIA Senior Economist Tom Devitt said new home sales remain at \"depressed levels.\" \"This indicates that the slowdown in home building that is underway will continue for at least the next year,\" Mr Devitt said. “The most significant contraction in sales is in New South Wales where customers are more sensitive to rises in the cash rate. “Cancellations also remain elevated at a rate of 25 per cent in the last quarter. This means, for every four new projects a builder is recording, a previous project is being cancelled. “The RBA’s rate increases will continue to hold down new sales and cause further cancellations as finance becomes unobtainable for an increasing number of buyers. “The significant increase in the cost of land and construction across all jurisdictions over the past two years is compounding the impact of higher interest rates. \" Mr Devitt also blamed the National Construction Code which came into effect this year (which means houses need to be more energy efficient) for driving up construction costs and dampening demand. “This combination of factors will see home building continuing to contract for at least the next 12 months to its lowest level in more than a decade,” Mr Devitt said. He said sales of new homes in the three months to May 2023 compared to the same time last year are still down in most large states, led by New South Wales (-63.6 per cent), and followed by Queensland (-52.9 per cent), Victoria (-46.6 per cent) and South Australia (-29.5 per cent). Western Australia saw the only increase over the year, up by 19.4 per cent.",
