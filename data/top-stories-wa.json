Melbourne's job has become a lot harder with halfback Jahrome Hughes a late scratching after succumbing to a leg injury. Utility Tyran Wishart will start at 7 in 21. Craig Bellamy has also opted to start Bronson Garlick at hooker, with representative star Harry Grant coming off the bench, Queensland Maroons style. Captain Christian Welch is also benched in favour of Nelson Asofa-Solomona. Ryan Papenhuyzen 's broken leg (though not as bad as first thought) obviously has him back on the sidelines, but just minutes before that we also saw Storm winger Xavier Coates go down with an ankle. The good news for the Storm is they get back Justin Olam in the centres to replace Young Tonumaipea, who was targeted by Brisbane. Reimis Smith is also back, although he will move out onto the wing. For the Roosters, they're backline is similarly unrecognisable. Former Storm player Paul Momirovski and Origin rep Corey Allan form a new centre pairing, replacing Joey Manu (hamstring) and Billy Smith (jaw), while Jaxson Paulo will start on the wing in place of Joseph-Aukuso Sua'ali'i (concussion). Up front, Fletcher Baker returns to the bench, with Egan Butcher starting at prop.",
