Twenty-two Democrats joined with most Republicans in the chamber to censure Ms Tlaib for allegedly \"promoting false narratives\" on Hamas's October 7 attack on Israel and \"calling for the destruction of the state of Israel\". The final vote tally in the Republican-controlled chamber was 234-188 in favor of censure. The symbolic rebuke has no specific punishment. Ms Tlaib has repeatedly condemned the Hamas assault, while also criticizing US support for Israel as civilian deaths in Gaza continue to rise. The measure specifically cited a video Ms Tlaib published on social media containing the phrase \"from the river to the sea\". The pro-Palestinian rallying cry is viewed by many Jews as anti-Semitic and calling for Israel's eradication. She also enraged many fellow Democrats when she posted a video accusing President Joe Biden of supporting \"the genocide of the Palestinian people\". Israel denies accusations of genocide. Ms Tlaib rejected accusations of anti-Semitism during a speech on the House floor. \"I am the only Palestinian-American in Congress, and my perspective is needed more than ever,\" Ms Tlaib says. \"My criticism has always been of the Israeli government and [Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu's actions … The idea that criticising the government of Israel is anti-Semitic sets a very dangerous precedent. \"Palestinian people are not disposable\", Ms Tlaib added, taking a long pause as she became overcome with emotion.",
