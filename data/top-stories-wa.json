In his pitch he spoke of the long standing relationship between Muslims and First Australians before European colonisation. Forged between Yolŋu from North East Arnhem Land and traders from Makassar. The Lakemba Mosque was packed for regular Friday prayers where Mr Albanes urged voters in south-west Sydney asking the hundreds in attendance to \"appeal to our better angles.\" \"This referendum won't be decided by politicians it will be decided by everyone in this room above 18,\" he said. Mr Albanese also claimed that regardless of progressive or conservative arguments for the No vote it would leave the country stuck in addressing disadvantage. \"There is no progressive Yes or progressive No.\" \"Voting No leaves us nowhere. No recognition. No way forward.\" Alongside the PM President of the Australian National Imams Council Sheikh Shady Alsuleiman called on fellow muslims to vote yes. \"We are committed to the Voice and we will say Yes to the Voice.\" \"Inshallah on October 15 we will wake up and every single Australian will see the success of the Voice.\" The Labor Party is working hard to grow the Yes vote among multicultural and diverse communities. Yesterday Indigenous Affairs Minister Linda Burney addressed a group of about a hundred older Chinese-Australians with her speech translated into Mandarin and Cantonese.",
