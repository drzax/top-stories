Meg's distributes flowers for delivery from warehouses or through sub-contractors, but the ACCC says it used 156 location-based websites and in 7,462 Google Ads to portray itself as a local florist supplying flowers in suburbs and towns across Australia. Here's what ACCC Commissioner Liza Carver had to say: \"Many consumers prefer to seek out local businesses to support, and many also wish to source the freshest flowers in a suburb close to the recipient's address. \"We are taking this court action because we allege Meg's Flowers misled consumers into thinking they were ordering flowers from a local florist, when they were actually dealing with a national business and the orders were often fulfilled from a corporate warehouse outside of that suburb.\" The ACCC is seeking declarations, penalties, compliance orders, corrective notices and costs.",
