              "plaintext": "The Reserve Bank has raised the cash rate to 4.1%, a level not seen since early 2012. The bank's board decided to lift the cash rate target by 0.25 of a percentage point for the second month in a row, amid concerns inflation is taking too long to come down. The most recent monthly consumer price index from the Australian Bureau of Statistics showed prices rose 6.8 per cent over the year to April, up from the March reading due to some statistical noise caused by last year's temporary fuel excise cut. Unlike last month, today's move was not a complete surprise, with markets pricing in around a 35% chance of a rate rise in June and economist forecasts split. The increase will add around $76 a month to the repayments on a $500,000 loan, and twice that on a million-dollar 25-year mortgage.",
