He outlined steps being taken by the US in response to the attack, including: Providing ammunition and interceptors to replenish Israel's Iron Dome missile defence system Sharing intelligence and deploying experts to \"consult with and advise\" their Israeli counterparts on recovering hostages boosting US military assets in the      region \"to strengthen our deterrence\", such as moving a      carrier strike group with thousands of Navy personnel to the eastern      Mediterranean, and bolstering fighter aircraft numbers Mr Biden also said the US Congress, when it resumes this week, would be asked to take \"urgent action\" to fund the national security needs of America's critical partners. (This could be complicated by the fact the House of Representatives still has no speaker). Without naming adversaries like Iran or Hezbollah, he said: \"To any country, any organisation, anyone thinking of taking advantage of this situation, I have one word: don't. \"Our hearts may be broken but our resolve is clear.\" The president confirmed 14 American citizens were killed in the attack. \"We now know that American citizens are among those being held by Hamas,\" he added, but did not say how many.",

There are more than 10,000 Australians living in Israel, and more who are visiting as tourists. The official advice to Australians looking to leave is to take up commercial flights, however there have been widespread cancellations. Shadow Foreign Minsiter Simon Birmingham says repatriation flights should be looked at. \"Repatriation flights for Australians out of Israel are one option that should be actively considered,\" he said. \"Ultimately its for the government to find the best, fastest and safest way to help Australians to get home.\"",
