They say they'll take the question on notice, and cite confidentiality obligations to their clients. Senator Henderson points to a figure in the business case referring to $205 million to $215 million to be provided by the federal government. YATES: That was an assumption that was directly given to us (by the Department of Jobs, Precincts and Regions). HENDERSON: Did the assumption have any basis of fact? YATES: Well, you'd have to ask the department what was the basis of its information … HENDERSON: Well hang on a minute … you're the one preparing the business case, don't you scrutinise the assumptions to be given? Do you ask the question 'was this a committed amount' or 'on what basis are we assuming that we will receive $205 million as a worst case and $215 million as a best case from the federal government?' YATES: That assumption was an assumption that was given to us. HENDERSON: You just take that at face value? You don't query it, you don't question it, you don't say well what's the basis for it? WALKER: We can't answer that question because to do so we might reveal information that's part of cabinet in-confidence. HENDERSON: Oh that's just rubbish! … That is just an absolute cop out.
