Job ads on listings website Seek fell 1.4 per cent in April. SEEK job ads are now 21 per cent below their May 2022 peak, but still remain 35 per cent above pre-pandemic levels. NAB economist Taylor Nugent notes while job ads fell 20.6 per cent from their May 2022 peak to December, over the past four months have fallen just 0.5 per cent. \"The decline in job ads from May last year was a key indicator of some easing in exceptionally tight labour market conditions. This was especially evident in some pockets of the labour market, notably hospitality and tourism,\" Mr Nugent notes. Mr Nugent said the labour market overall remains tight with the unemployment rate still at 3.5 per cent, broadly where it has been since the middle of 2022. \"Strong labour demand is absorbing the strong lift in population growth without a lift in the unemployment rate.\" \"Applications per Job Ad, released with a 1-month lag, continue to increase from the lows of May 2022, and are similar to 2018 levels, which also suggests some of the more acute challenges finding labour may be receding.\" Despite the overall decline, 11 of 28 industries recorded an increase in ads in the month. The largest increase was recorded in Education and Training. \"This high-employing industry has a tailwind from the rapid rebound in international students and is the only industry to see advertising above the earlier May 2022 peak. Education and Training Ads are now at a new high, 3% higher than in May 2022. The number of international students has rebounded sharply, rising 246k, or 73%, in the year to Q1 2023,\" Mr Nugent notes. \"In contrast, Hospitality & Tourism Ads, another high-employing industry, was among the largest decliners in the month with advertising falling 5.7%,\" he notes. Official Bureau of Statistics unemployment data comes out on Thursday. NAB forecasts the unemployment rate to move higher toward 4 per cent by the end of 2023.",
