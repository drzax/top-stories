And more sectors joined the falls, most ending in the red: The major miners fell, as did energy stocks. The major banks were mixed — Westpac lost 1 per cent after announcing the sale of BT Platforms would not be going ahead. Commonwealth Bank shares edged 0.1 per cent higher as it revealed it would refinance loans with a 1 per cent interest rate buffer, instead of the 3 per cent prescribed by the regulator, but only for select customers with loan-to-value ratios of 80 per cent or less. Discretionary retailers were mostly weaker, while consumer staples stocks like Woolworths (+0.9%) and Coles (+0.7%) ended higher. Telstra finished the session flat, following news its regional network sharing deal with TPG remains blocked. Here are the biggest individual stock moves of the session: Bottom 5: Flight Centre (-6.9%) TPG Telecom (-6.6%) Silver Lake Resources (-5.2%) Premier Investments (-4.6%) West African Resources (-3.4%) Top 5: Telix Pharmaceuticals (+5.9%) Collins Foods (+5.6%) Lake Resources (+4.1%) Magellan Financial (+3.9%) Sayona Mining (+2.8%) Looking ahead to European and US trade tonight, investors will be closely watching an appearance before Congress by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, and no doubt dissecting what it means for US interest rates. Around the region, markets in Shanghai and Hong Kong will be closed tomorrow for the Dragon Boat Festival holiday.

The survey, conducted over the second half of May, shows a decline in the financial outlook from Australian consumers, as a bigger portion of their spending went essentials like rent and utilities. \"Middle-income households are now showing clear signs that the transmission of pain  from the rate hiking cycle (which began over a year ago) is now hitting hard,\" UBS strategists wrote. \"…Consumers in 'mortgage belt' Australia are telling us that they expect to sharply reduce  their spending on 'fun' categories, such as entertainment, recreation, eating out, takeaway food, and international travel.\" The survey also found evidence of a divide: \"Many low-income consumers have now run out of savings, and are increasingly having  to borrow from others, or sell their belongings, to fund daily spending. \"By contrast, high  income consumers are in a favourable position with ample cash balances and the ability  to draw down on investments.\" As a result, UBS has changed its rating or earnings estimates for a number of consumer stocks, and some of those are in the red today: JB Hi-Fi (-2.1%) Harvey Norman (-2%) Super Retail Group (-2%) Premier Investments (-3.9%)",
