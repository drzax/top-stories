The research, commissioned by Australian Council of Superannuation Investors, shows the average realised pay for CEOS of Australia's largest 100 publicly listed companies dropped from record highs seen in 2021 — likely because of tougher economic conditions and boardroom attitudes. In 2021, the investor group's research saw average CEO realised pay — which includes bonuses on top of base salaries — reached a high of 98 times the average weekly earnings of an Australian adult. Now, the average CEO pay has fallen, but is still 55 times higher than what the average Australian earns. \"It is good to see more restraint on executive pay in Australian companies over the past year but there is still an 'everyone wins a prize' attitude in some parts of the market. Investors look for any bonuses paid to executives to be linked to the delivery of value to shareholders over the long-term.\" Ed John, ACSI's head of stewardship said. \"Investors will be watching closely as reporting season gets under way and we see the numbers for 2023. It has been a choppy year for investors in many companies – boards will need to consider performance carefully when deciding on remuneration this year. \"If performance is down in 2023, we expect to see bonuses follow. We don't want to see companies changing the goalposts when they have a bad year.\" Fixed pay for CEOs has also fallen in the past decade, with median fixed pay in the last financial year for the ASX100 CEOs coming in at $1,741,724.",

The UN report found both domestic and external debt around the world increased more than five times in the last 20 years — a rate faster than economic growth, when gross domestic product (GDP) only tripled. The report comes days before a G20 meeting of finance ministers and central bank governors. \"Markets may seem not be suffering — yet. But people are,\" UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said. \"Some of the poorest countries in the world are being forced into a choice between servicing their debt, or serving their people.\" Of all the public debt, developing countries make up around 30% of it, with 70% coming from China, India and Brazil. The UN report also says 59 developing countries have a debt-to-GDP ratio over 60%, which indicates high levels of debt.",
