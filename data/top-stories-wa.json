This is what Dr Karishma says: Dr Karishma: Dogs are incredibly intuitive and in tune with our sounds, smells, visual cues and emotions. It is not uncommon for them to pick up on how we are feeling and alter their behaviour when they sense that we are sad, stressed, happy, angry or excited. They can display this by trying to comfort us more through nuzzling up, trying to be close to us or simply putting a paw on our lap when upset. Or barking, doing 'zoomies' and vocalising or even singing along with us when they detect we are excited. Not all dog's will pick up on scent changes, but certainly we have been training dog's for some time to assist us with detection of drugs, weapons and more recently even in healthcare to detect onset of epileptic fits or changes in blood sugar levels. So no doubt they have the capability of detecting alterations in some of our hormones.",

How do I get him to stop barking and snarling very aggressively when people come to my house? Thanks for your question Gab and it's one others who've adopted a dog have asked about too. Here's Laura V's take: Laura V: If you are concerned that it is very distressing to him, it may be worth considering crate training him, making sure the crate is a safe place for him that he can control. This does take a lot of time and patience. You can opt for your visitors to ignore him and offer him yummy food, on the floor nearby. But in all honesty, he may have a little PTSD and will always default to reacting this way as his first option. Sometimes dogs with these anxieties benefit from different nutraceuticals which can be discussed with your vet. Your vet may also want to discuss examining your dog and assessing him for other pharmaceutical options too. It is always important to consider the world from the dog's point of view and recognise that their behaviours are a means of communicating with us. Sometimes dogs are so distressed that they cannot focus or learn new ways of dealing with their fears... and so chatting about these veterinary treatment options is worthwhile.",

She's made us all a bit voyeuristic, as we want to check out what caught her attention! But how do you ask a dog to please stop barking? Or, at least, reduce barking? Chloe: Hi Laura and Dr Karishma! Our 7 month old Golden Retriever is a serial barker. She barks at the door at noises, cats, neighbours, or even at nothing sometimes... Do you have any advice? It's driving us a little crazy ! I thought it was about time we got to this question - barking at everything, anything or nothing is something a LOT of you have asked about. It's a long post but I promise the info is worth it! Here's Dr Karishma's take: Dr Karishma: Dog's bark for a variety of reasons and it is a part of their natural behaviour too. Some very common reasons your dog may be barking are to communicate with you or other animals, fear, territorial behaviour, boredom and separation anxiety. It is a complex issue and one that doesn't typically have a 'quick fix'. However fear not, there are strategies out there to help reduce this unwanted behaviour. Some tips to reduce nuisance barking include company. Whether this is from you as the pet owner, or another pet or even a pet sitter. Often having company for our canine friend's will enrich their environment and help them feel at ease. It allows for play and enrichment and interaction as often the barking can arise from frustration or from being alone for too long. Regular exercise is also a very important one to keep their minds active, as well as plenty of stimulation and games for them at home. If they are food driven, large chews can help to occupy them for hours. Finally tackling territorial barking can be combated through fence design to restrict your dog's view to what's going on beyond the fence line. And this is Laura V 's advice: Laura V: The trick here is to find out why. What triggers your dog to just bark at your neighbour? Is your dog anxious? Afraid? Excited? What is the emotional state of your dog at the time? Once you know what this is you can work on helping your dog understand who the neighbour is. Barking is important to dogs, so allow your dog to communicate, but if you can see your dog is getting stressed, try to prevent him from being in the position that makes him feel that way - draw down blinds, play music, play a game etc. Often if you pair high value yummy rewards with your voice/presence, this can help to change the dog's perception of you - from being territorial to seeing you as a positive opportunity. Try to remember that barking doesn't mean you're not friends, it often just means they are letting you know they see you and that they know you're there. It may be worth trying to take them for a walk together, providing that is a safe option and that they are set up for success.",

              "plaintext": "Saudi Arabia and Russia, the world's biggest oil exporters, have slashed their oil production even further overnight, sending prices higher despite concerns over a global economic slowdown and possible further interest rate increases from the US Federal Reserve. OPEC+ (which groups the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and allies led by Russia) has already been cutting supply to boost prices since November last year due to weaker Chinese demand and rising US supply. Despite that, it has failed to move oil prices outside a range of $US70 - $US80 a barrel. Saudi Arabia said it would extend its voluntary oil output cut of 1 million barrels per day (bpd) for another month to include August, adding that the cut could be extended beyond that month. Shortly after the Saudi announcement, Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak said Moscow would cut its oil exports by 500,000 barrels per day in August. The cuts amount to 1.5% of global supply and bring the total pledged by OPEC+ to 5.16 million bpd. OPEC+, which pumps around 40% of the world's crude oil, already has in place cuts of 3.66 million bpd. This amounts to 3.6% of global demand (including 2 million bpd agreed last year and voluntary cuts of 1.66 million bpd agreed in April and extended to December 2024). Brent crude futures were up 0.4% to $US75 a barrel.",

However, the gains were limited by looming uncertainty on whether the Reserve Bank will further lift interest rates today. By 12:05pm AEST, the ASX 200 index was flat at 7,251 points, close to its highest level in two weeks. The RBA is widely expected to hike interest rates by 25 basis points to 4.35%, though a Reuters poll of economists highlighted a divided outlook. While the latest monthly measure of consumer prices showed inflation slowed to 5.6% in May (from 6.8% in April), it was still well above the RBA's 2 - 3% target range, suggesting more monetary tightening may be required. Shares of Costa Group jumped 12.2% after the horticulture firm said it had received a $1.4 billion takeover proposal from US private equity firm Paine Schwartz Partners LLC for shares it does not already own.

It also expects to spend more than $100 million in trasitional \"employment and operational costs\". The new entity will be called Scyne Advisory, and have around 1,750 ex-PwC staff. In a statement, Allegro said the new business will be \"fully independent\" of PwC. In recent months, PwC has been caught up in a damaging tax scandal. It led to eight senior partners being forced out, government departments refusing to extend their consulting contracts with the firm, and its senior management being grilled before Senate inquiries. The scandal involved a senior partner using secret information it obtained from the government (while advising it on on how to increase the tax paid by multinational companies), working out a loophole to get around them, and selling the plan to those companies, making millions of dollars in fees. Some commentors have compared PwC's conduct as simliar to a 'double agent'. \"Scyne Advisory will establish an independent Board of Directors to oversee a rigorous, ASX-standard of governance and integrity in the business,\" Allegro said. To allay concerns about the integrity of the new business, Allegro has hired former Federal Court judge Andrew Greenwood to join the board as a non-executive director. Mr Greenwood will chair an ethics subcommittee to check on the probity of employees joining Scyne Advisory, as well as future conflicts and code of conduct. Allegro said it expects the deal to be finalised by the end of August.",
