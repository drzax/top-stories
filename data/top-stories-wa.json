Most sectors are in the red with energy stocks and banks weighing on the index. Petrol refiner and service station owner Viva Energy (-7 per cent) has slumped on a media report that major shareholder Vitol could trim its stake. Miners are doing the best thanks to higher copper and iron ore prices. Liontown Resources shares are down 0.3 per cent to $3.00 after Gina Rinehart's Hancock Prospecting raised its stake. Last week, Liontown accepted a $6.6 billion takeover bid from global lithium giant Albemarle. Best and worst performers: Telix Pharmaceuticals: +3.5% Megaport: +2.3% Ingenia Communities: +1.9% Viva Energy: -7.3% Syrah Resources: -5.7% Chalice Mining: -5.7%",

Business conditions rose 2 points in August with trading conditions, profitability and employment all increasing across most industries. Conditions were the best in manufacturing, but conditions fell sharply in the wholesale industry. Business confidence edged up by 2 index points, but it remains below average. And confidence is mixed across industries, with confidence remaining weakest in retail as people cut back on spending because of the high cost of living. Weighing on sentiment is a fall in forward orders, especially in car retailing and personal and household goods. NAB says that partly reflects normalising order books as backlogs are cleared. Confidence was also negative in mining, finance, business and property. National Australia Bank chief economist Alan Oster says businesses continue to face rising costs, including higher wages and purchasing costs. \"Price growth also remains elevated which reflects the considerable cost pressures businesses are facing, as well as the ongoing resilience of demand.\" \"We expect inflation to remain elevated in Q3 (quarter 3).\" Mr Oster says demand for labour remained strong.",

Negotiations between the Offshore Alliance union and Chevron over pay and conditions have broken down. Chevron has applied to the Fair Work Commission asking it to intervene in the strike, which began on Friday at the Gorgon and Wheatstone projects in northern Western Australia. Chevron wants the commission to halt the industrial action through an intractable bargaining declaration and says there is no reasonable prospect of an agreement on a new EBA. But the Offshore Alliance says it opposes the application. \"The Offshore Allliance are opposing Chevron's IBD applications and want PIA (protected industrial action) to continue until we secure a union negotiated EBA.\" Work stoppages of up to 10 hours a day are expected to last until Thursday when a two-week strike is expected to kick off if there is no deal. There will be a directions hearing today on Chevron's application in the Fair Work Commission. Gas prices in Europe have surged, with the two projects responsible for more than 5 per cent of global LNG supply.",
