Forecasts from the United Nations' humanitarian office was more urgent, saying reserves of fuel at all hospitals across the Gaza Strip are only expected to last around 24 more hours. \"The shutdown of backup generators would place the lives of thousands of patients at risk,\" OCHA said on its website. Dr Muhanna says he has been able to send five critical patients to a specialist centre but still has 10 in the hospital and is struggling to move them. \"All the hospitals are overcrowded,\" he's told ABC News. \"Even if I want to coordinate with other hospitals, I can't. They have no beds. They're putting patients in the corridors. \"We have supplies for one-and-a-half months, but that's on regular days. In war days, the consumption increases more than 50 to 70 per cent. \"This storage of medications will last 10-14 days maximum. Local markets cannot deliver anything for us and we can't get anything from outside. \"We have enough fuel for four or five days maximum. The hospital will stop activities, we will close the doors.\"",

Saints don't want to cough up pick 13 or pick 21 Brandon Zerk-Thatcher to Port Adelaide and Xavier Duursma to Essendon. Is a straight swap in the offing? Shane McAdam to Melbourne. Dees are offering a future second, Crows have been trying (and failing) to get a move for Harrison Petty going with it Jack Gunston to Hawthorn. Hawks have been clear this isn't their priority, but could still be done later in the week Mabior Chol to Hawthorn, Jacob Koschitzke to Richmond. Every chance these end up linked with the Suns getting involved in a three-way trade Paddy Dow to St Kilda, Nick Coffield to Western Bulldog s.

The incoming boss of PwC Australia was criticised for bringing Ms Walsh, because she was so new in the role and couldn't answer questions about the historic allegations the committee is investigating - and the 'now and future' problems they've created. Asked about her status in the firm, she responded: \"I have been with the firm for three years and I've been in my current role as chief people officer since July.\" And today, she's gone! Ms Walsh will become Chief People Officer at Qantas, a press release has announced. \"In this new role, Ms Walsh will help drive a stronger relationship between Qantas and its 25,000 employees, as well as with the unions that represent them. This function will also help lead the recruitment of thousands of new roles across the Group in coming years as it takes delivery of new aircraft and returns to growth.\" The airline has a bit of work to do in the 'HR space'... it fought it's own employees all the way to the appeals court of the High Court, losing all the way, after it sacked 1700 of them illegally. As was reported at the time: Qantas maintained it made the decision for sound commercial reasons after its business plummeted by more than 90 per cent. But the Transport Workers' Union (TWU) told the High Court the airline had also been motivated to head off industrial action when things returned to normal. The union said the sackings were in breach of the Fair Work Act, which prohibited actions that interfered with a worker's rights. Ms Walsh will start in January 2024.",
