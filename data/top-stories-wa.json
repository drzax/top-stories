Sun Cable's administrators say the company has entered into a sale agreement with an entity connected to Cannon-Brookes' Grok Ventures. Under the multi-billionaire's control, it is likely the project will still pursue its original goal of exporting solar power from the outback of Australia to the island nation of Singapore.",
