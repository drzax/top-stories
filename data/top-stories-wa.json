Members of the Last Generation group used fire extinguishers filled with paint to spray all six columns of the popular landmark. \"The protest makes it clear: It is time for a political change,\" the group said in a statement. \"Away from fossil fuels — towards fairness.\" Police cordoned off the area surrounding the gate, and confirmed they had detained 14 activists affiliated with the Last Generation. Berlin Mayor Kai Wegner has condemned the group's actions. \"With these actions, this group is not only damaging the historic Brandenburg Gate, but also our free discourse about the important issues of our time and future,\" he told a German news agency. The actions came at the same time that thousands marched to kick off New York Climate Week .",
