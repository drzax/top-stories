The ASX 200 index climbed 1.8 per cent to 7,315 points, by 12:26pm AEST, and looked set to post its sharpest daily rise since mid, if gains held. The benchmark has risen 1.6 per cent so far in the week, heading for its best week in nearly two months. Investors worldwide were awaiting a slew of data from China, which has been struggling to prop up its economy after a brief post-COVID recovery. Back home, data released on Thursday showed that Australian jobs surged in August. However, it did not dent hopes for the country's central bank to stand pat on interest rates next month. Heavyweight miners led the gains, rising 3.3 per cent in their biggest intraday percentage climb since July 25 on strong metal prices. Mining giants BHP and Rio Tinto climbed 3.8 per cent each, while Fortescue was up 4.4 per cent. Financials rose 1.4 per cent, with the \"big four\" banks up between 1 per cent and 1.6 per cent. Energy stocks advanced 2.1 per cent as oil prices rose to their highest level in 2023. Sector major Woodside Energy was up 1.9 per cent.",
