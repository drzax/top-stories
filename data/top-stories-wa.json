              "plaintext": "The local share market has risen to its highest level in four weeks, and managed to snap a two-day losing streak. Strong gains in mining and energy stocks helped to lift the ASX 200 index up 0.6%, to close at 7,324 points. The miners rose after iron ore prices closed higher overnight, boosted by heightened expectations of more supportive measures from China following weaker-than-expected economic data. Rio Tinto fell 0.7%, after the mining giant flagged concerns about a global economic slowdown, and reported its second-quarter iron ore shipments missed analysts' estimates, BHP and Fortescue Metals fell 0.3% and 1.9% respectively. Woodside Energy climbed 1.4% even after reporting its second-quarter revenue missed estimates due to weaker liquefied natural gas prices and maintenance work at some of its facilities in Western Australia. Fuel retailer Ampol gained 4.4% after revealing its Lytton refinery margin for June improved to $US12.69 per barrel, reflecting improved production mix as the refinery returned to normal operations by the end of May as planned. BrainChip Holdings surged 6.8% to mark its best day in six weeks after the advanced AI chipmaker received a patent grant in the United States on one of its neuromorphic processors. Neuromorphic processors mimic the way the brain works and allow devices to use signals from physical neurons to carry out computations. On the flip side, Northern Star Resources plunged 5.8% after unveiling its full-year production forecast (which fell short of market expectations).",

Hong Kong's Hang Seng index fell 1.2%, and has been falling daily since China's weak economic growth data on Monday underscored the country's faltering pandemic recovery. Japan's Nikkei rose 0.9% and touched a two-week peak. Headline US retail sales data came in below forecasts, but core sales which exclude food, fuel and building materials, rose a solid 0.6% in June and had economists lifting gross domestic product (GDP) forecasts. Major US bank shares rose sharply on strong results, which drove Wall Street's industrial index, the Dow Jones, up 1.1% Shares of Microsoft surged 4%, adding $US100 billion in market value, after the company announced charges for artificial intelligence features in office software, a big first step in monetising AI's potential. Meanwhile, New Zealand inflation came in at 6% year-on-year (slower than a reading of 6.7% a month earlier), but above the market's expectations. Investors are now expecting NZ rates to stay higher for longer.",
