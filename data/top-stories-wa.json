It has also called on Israel to avoid targeting the Palestinian side of the crossing, saying \"repeated bombing\" has prevented it from operating normally. For context, two days ago the Israeli military issued a statement which said the gateway between Egypt and Gaza was closed, shortly after suggesting that Palestinian civilians should escape through the crossing. The only other roads out of Gaza are controlled by Israel. In a statement released this evening, Egypt's Foreign Ministry called on all countries and international organizations wishing to provide humanitarian aid to deliver supplies to el-Arish International Airport, in Egypt’s northern Sinai.
