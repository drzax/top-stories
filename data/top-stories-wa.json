The 80-year-old got up quickly and walked back to his seat, and the White House says he's \"totally fine\". After Biden was helped up, he pointed behind him, seeming to indicate what he tripped over. He mingled with other officials afterward, smiling and giving a \"thumbs up\" sign. The whole moment was caught on video: White House communications director Ben LaBolt says on Twitter that Biden is fine. \"There was a sandbag on stage while he was shaking hands,\" he says. Former president Donald Trump, was asked about Biden's fall soon after and said, \"He actually fell down? Well I hope he wasn't hurt.\" Trump, who is running for president again in 2024, added \"you gotta be careful about that\", even if you have to \"tip-toe down a ramp\".",

The Fair Work Commission will broadcast the result of its latest wage review at 10am AEST, which will determine the new award and minimum wage rates which will come into effect from July 1. It's expected to impact 2.67 million of the lowest-paid Australians, including 184,000 people on the minimum wage. The federal government is advocating for a rise that ensures the nation's lowest-paid workers are not going backwards. With inflation at 6.8 per cent in the year to April, this would require a wage rise of at least 6.9 per cent. But business groups want to see a more modest increase, to help contain inflation and ward off the threat of a recession. Some economists also warn a too-generous rise could add to pressure on the Reserve Bank to push up interest rates next week.",
