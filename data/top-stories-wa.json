              "plaintext": "Reporting by Orly Halpern in Jerusalem On the morning of the Hamas attack on October 7, Israelis thought that a few dozen militants had broken through the Gaza border fence. The Israeli Defense Force's (IDF) high command had difficulty getting a picture of what was going on because the militants had simultaneously attacked all the military outposts along the border, including the headquarters of the Gaza Division. But within a few days, the estimate rose to 1,500 to 2,000 militants entering through 20 points across the 58-kilometre border fence. Now, after interrogating captured militants, the IDF has a clearer picture of the sheer scale of the attack. It estimates that some 3,000 members of Hamas's military wing infiltrated Israel through dozens of points along the border fence as well as by air (in the form of a paraglider) and sea. This number does not include Gazan civilians who crossed through the torn down fence at about 11am in the second mass wave, some of whom killed people, took hostages and looted. By the time Israel regained control two days later, the security forces had killed 1,000 militants and captured 200. The rest either managed to return to the Gaza Strip or their bodies are still laying around the Israeli border communities. The IDF expects to finish collecting the militants' bodies in the coming days after making sure they aren't booby-trapped.",

Trade numbers for September are out from the ABS and there's both bad and good news in the numbers. The bad news is that Australia's trade surplus dropped by nearly $3.4 billion to just shy of $6.8 billion. That's the lowest it's been since March 2021. The good news is that Australia is still posting an historically large trade surplus, and also that the reason it shrank is not so much to do with a fall in exports, which were down just 1.4%, but rather a surge in imports (up 7.5%). The good news on imports is twofold. First, it shows demand for goods hasn't completely collapsed — although the 0.3% rise for consumption goods is pretty tiny when you consider how much inflation is pushing up prices, so the volume of consumer goods imports must surely have fallen. The better news is that imports were driven higher by a 23.3% jump in capital goods coming into the country, mainly industrial transport equipment. That is hopefully a sign that businesses are following through with investment plans, and capital goods imports should (in theory at least) be productivity enhancing. But there is another bit of bad news in the data, about what it might mean for Australia's economic growth as measured by GDP and whether we can avoid a technical recession. This from Marcel Thieliant, head of Asia-Pacific at Capital Economics. \"The slump in the trade balance in September increases the risk that the Australian economy entered a recession in the third quarter, but we suspect that a large drag from net trade will have been offset by stock building and a modest rise in domestic demand,\" he writes. \"We now estimate that net trade knocked off 1.5%-pts from Q3 GDP growth, which would be one of the largest drags from net exports ever recorded. \"But we suspect that will be mostly offset by a reversal of the unusually large 1.1%-pts drag from inventories in the second quarter. \"So while today's data increase the risk that the recession we expect to start this quarter already begun last quarter, we suspect that the economy will have continued to expand in Q3.\" Of course, in per person terms, Australia is already in a recession, with GDP per capita having fallen 0.3% in both of the first two quarters this calendar year.",
