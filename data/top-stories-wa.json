Unit labour costs are also rising briskly, with productivity growth remaining subdued.\" In particular, Mr Lowe drew attention to last week's slightly bigger than expected rise in minimum and award wages, which was the highest in decades. \"Wages growth has picked up in response to the tight labour market and high inflation,\" he observed. \"Growth in public sector wages is expected to pick up further and the annual increase in award wages was higher than it was last year. \"At the aggregate level, wages growth is still consistent with the inflation target, provided that productivity growth picks up.\" In contrast — Treasurer Jim Chalmers has pointed out that the rate rise is because of inflation, not the higher wages announced by the Fair Work Commission last week.
