The Bureau of Statistics has released its latest industrial disputes data today. It shows the number of industrial disputes, and the number of days lost to industrial disputes, fell significantly in the March quarter. It shows only 7,700 working days were lost to disputes in the March quarter, a decrease from 21,000 in the December quarter. If you see in that graph, you'll notice that industrial disputes have been dramatically lower since 1992 and 1993, after some changes to industrial laws by the Keating Government and the introduction of the inflation targeting era. If you take industrial disputes as a proxy for workers' ability to command higher wage increases, it shows how they've progressively declined over recent decades. Economic authorities were worried about that recent uptick in the industrial disputes, hoping it wasn't going to lead to higher pay increases and more disruption during this inflation crisis. But there's no sign that that uptick has been sustained. We're back to exceptionally-low levels.",

This week, the RBA raised the cash rate for a twelfth time to 4.1 per cent, its highest rate in more than a decade. Anna Bligh, CEO of the Australian Banking Association, says more customers are \"thinking of what other options they might have\" if rising rates make it \"impossible\" for some customers to keep up with their repayments. She encouraged borrowers who are struggling to call their bank to discuss their options sooner rather than later. \"There are very practical ways that banks can help to ease the financial pressure, temporarily, for several months,\" she said. \"They can put you on an interest-only arrangement, they can, in some cases, defer payments for a period of time.\" You can listen to the full interview between Hamish Macdonald and Anna Bligh via the RN Breakfast website .",
