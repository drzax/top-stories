On Wednesday at precisely 11:30am AEST the Australian Bureau of Statistics will release the June quarter Consumer Price Index (CPI). The typical market forecast is for headline quarterly inflation of 1% and annual at 6.2%, down from 1.4% and 7% respectively in the March quarter. The critical 'core' trimmed mean figure for inflation, most closely watched by the RBA because it strips out the most volatile price moves, is generally tipped to drop to 1.1% and 6% for the quarter and year, respectively, according to a Refinitiv survey of economists. Westpac senior economist Justin Smirk released the bank's CPI forecast late last week. It's worth reading because it breaks down each major category and goes into detail about why Westpac is tipping the number it is. The forecast has also generally been pretty close to the mark quite often. Westpac's headline forecast is 1.1% for the quarter and 6.3% for the year to June, which is a touch above the market consensus, but it's core inflation forecast is on the average. \"The Monthly CPI Indicator is turning out to be a very helpful guide to the components of the CPI and we have used the data from the April and May surveys to fine tune our forecasts,\" Mr Smirk wrote. \"Despite the additional information provided by the Monthly CPI Indicator, there are still many significant unknowns we have to estimate.\" Having crunched those numbers, Westpac expects electricity subsidies to push down utility prices by 1.2% over the quarter, with holiday travel costs falling 2%, putting downward pressure on CPI. Healthcare costs are also expected to fall 1.1% as households hit their spending threshold to received government subsidies, while education is likely to be flat after huge price hikes in the March quarter. On the flip side, fruit and vegetables (+2.8%), rents (+2.4%) and financial and insurance services (+2.5%) are all tipped to have seen steeper price rises over the three months to June than over the first quarter of the year. \"Overall, the June quarter CPI is set to confirm that inflationary pressures peaked in late 2022 and continue to moderate as we move through 2023,\" Mr Smirk tipped. \"However, it will also continue to highlight that core inflation remains significantly above the top of the RBA's target band and is not likely to return to being within the band any time soon.\" Westpac is currently expecting the RBA to leave rates on hold at 4.1% when it meets next week, but says it will be another finely balanced decision.",

The ASX 200 index was up just 0.1% in the first half hour to 7,321 points and the All Ords up just 6 points to 7,532. This morning's best gains have come from the energy sector, with a couple of coal miners in the top ten — Whitehaven (+2.3%) and New Hope (+1.9%). The tech sector was also up, with WiseTech Global (+1.7%) and REA Group (+1.4%) amongst the biggest gains. The financial sector continued to edge higher (+0.2%) with all four major banks posting modest gains. But the large mining sector weighed on the ASX, with BHP and Rio Tinto broadly flat, and suppliers of commodities needed for batteries, such as lithium and nickel, generally getting pummeled. Core Lithium had dropped 13.2%, with Sayona Mining and Lake Resources down 5.9%, Liontown down 4.6% and Pilbara Minerals off 4.3%.",

The key bit locally is the June quarter Consumer Price Index, to be released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics on Wednesday at 11:30am AEST. Economists are typically expecting the headline number to fall to 6.2%, with the RBA's preferred 'trimmed mean' measure of inflation easing to 6%, according to a Refinitiv survey. The consensus is broadly that a number much above those levels will all but guarantee another interest rate hike on August 1, while a number in line with or below those forecasts is more likely to see the RBA stay on hold at a 4.1% cash rate. A rise in rates would be bad for many stocks — it lifts the valuation benchmark for one thing, but also increases the prospect of an Australian recession, which is not great for the earnings outlook. Ahead of those key numbers (which I'll have more about shortly) the ASX SPI 200 futures are up 0.4% to 7,300 points. That followed a quiet Friday session on Wall Street, where the Dow Jone Industrial Average and S & P 500 were almost dead flat, and the Nasdaq down just slightly. I suggest grabbing a coffee, or another one, because you might need it to get through what could be quite a dull day on the markets.",
