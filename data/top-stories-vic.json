France, Italy and Spain have all announced evacuations from Niger for their citizens and other European nationals, concerned that they risked becoming trapped by the coup. The Associated Press says about 600 French nationals want to leave, along with 400 people of other nationalities from Belgians to Danish, according to officials. The first flight carried mostly French nationals, and officials hope to finish the evacuation flights by today. With Niger's air space closed, France coordinated the evacuations with the regime that ousted the nation's leader, but without withdrawing its support for democratically elected President Mohamed Bazoum, diplomatic officials say.

              "plaintext": "New Zealand's unemployment rate climbed to a two year high over the June quarter amid a rise in the number of people looking for work. While the labour market is tight, the jobless rate rose from 3.4 per cent to 3.6 per cent seasonally adjusted with 109,000 people out of work according to Statistics New Zealand. It says the labour force participation rate of 72.4 per cent and the employment rate of 69.8 per cent are the highest on record. The tourism industry drove the increase with employment returning to pre-COVID levels. Wages increased by 4.3 per cent over the year to June. The Reserve Bank of New Zealand is expected to leave official interest rates unchanged at 5.5 per cent this month. The country's economy is in recession which was triggered by the central bank's aggressive rate rise campaign. While New Zealand's jobless rate is at a two year high, Australia's unemployment rate of 3.5 per cent, is near a fifty year low. New Zealand closed its borders from early 2020 to mid 2022 because of COVID-19, which drove down the unemployment rate because temporary migration was restricted.",

Uber made a net profit of $US394 million ($596 million) from a net loss of $US2.6 billion ($3.9 billion) from the same quarter last year. Profit was boosted as its share market investments were revalued higher. Gross bookings rose by 16 per cent over the year to $US33.6 billion. About 25 million trips were made on the platform a day on average from April to June as travel recovered from the pandemic. Uber chief executive Dana Khoswoshahi said the company saw its first quarterly operating profit and its first quarter of free cash flow of more than $US1 billion. He says Uber is looking at further expanding into the travel market with flight, train and coach bookings available on its app. Mr Khoswoshahi says Uber is the rideshare leader in the majority of its international markets hitting record highs in Australia and Japan. However, its shares fell 5.7 per cent because its revenue of $US9.2 billion wasn't as good as expected by analysts.",
