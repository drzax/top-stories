He says councils weren't treated as partners and Geelong made official complaints about the pressure being applied and lack of time they were given to make high-level decisions. He says these included a two-day deadline for the council to provide input on the Games planning. \"That was the standard that was set going forward for communication for the state government and the City of Greater Geelong,\" he says. He says Geelong's concerns went unanswered and were proved to be founded when, weeks later, the Games were cancelled. He says he received a phone call from the government 10 minutes before the premier's press conference to announce the cancellation of the games. \"It was a blow and it still is a blow to me,\" Cr Sullivan says.

Senator Colbeck continues to push the representatives to comment on the final costs (which they weren't involved in providing), or detail an example of another project that had a similar capital cost blow out as the 2026 Commonwealth Games. They say they'll take the question on notice, and cite confidentiality obligations to their clients. Senator Henderson points to a figure in the business case referring to $205 million to $215 million to be provided by the federal government. YATES: That was an assumption that was directly given to us (by the Department of Jobs, Precincts and Regions). HENDERSON: Did the assumption have any basis of fact? YATES: Well, you'd have to ask the department what was the basis of its information … HENDERSON: Well hang on a minute … you're the one preparing the business case, don't you scrutinise the assumptions to be given? Do you ask the question 'was this a committed amount' or 'on what basis are we assuming that we will receive $205 million as a worst case and $215 million as a best case from the federal government?' YATES: That assumption was an assumption that was given to us. HENDERSON: You just take that at face value? You don't query it, you don't question it, you don't say well what's the basis for it? WALKER: We can't answer that question because to do so we might reveal information that's part of cabinet in-confidence. HENDERSON: Oh that's just rubbish! … That is just an absolute cop out.

              "plaintext": "Fortescue shares remain under pressure, down 4.3 per cent as the broader market rises. It follows a 23 per cent drop in full year net profit and the shock announcement that the chief executive of its metals business, Fiona Hick, has exited after less than half a year. The boss of Fortesuce Future Industries, the company's newer energy division, Mark Hutchinson, faced questions over the news on an analyst briefing, and revealed the board made the \"mutual decision\" just yesterday. Here's more from Reuters: The world's fourth-largest iron ore miner, overseen by founder Andrew Forrest as executive chairman, has been beset by senior management turnover over the past two years while its key Iron Bridge project has seen multiple delays and cost overruns. Fortescue has been expanding into green energy and has reorganised into two divisions under energy and metals, with the CEOs of each unit reporting to Forrest and the board. \"This organisation does not rely on just one or two people to drive direction,\" said incoming Fortescue Metals CEO Dino Otranto, who took the helm of the company's iron ore division two years ago and will replace Hick. \"I am left with no doubt whatsoever that we have the most amazing team behind this crazy vision that we have got, and we are going to nail it,\" Otranto said. The decision by Fortescue's board and Hick, who took on the co-CEO role in February, to part ways was made on Sunday. Hick was at a party hosted by Forrest in Western Australia over the weekend to celebrate 20 years in operation, CEO Mark Hutchinson of the firm's energy division confirmed. Hick said in a statement on Monday she valued her experience at Fortescue and would take time to consider her next move. When pressed for more information on Hick's departure on an earnings call, Hutchinson declined to provide further details on the reasons for her exit or around the decision that elevated Otranto to the co-CEO spot. \"I do think shareholders deserve a better explanation given that she departed only after five months in the role and also considering the C-Suite changes over the past two to three years,\" said Goldman Sachs analyst Paul Young on the call. Ian Wells, Fortescue's former chief financial officer, stepped down at the end of January, meaning almost all of the senior executives from a year previous had changed. Executive chairman Andrew Forrest, who has been taking a greater role speaking to stakeholders on results, was absent from the earnings call. \"He was not available today,\" Hutchinson said.",
