It follows an increase of 0.3% in August, and a 0.6% rise in July, according to the ABS. \"The strong rise in September came from a diverse range of factors across the Retail industry,\" said Ben Dorber, head of retail statistics at the ABS. “The warmer-than-usual start to spring lifted turnover at departments stores, household goods and clothing retailers, with more spending on hardware, gardening, and clothing items. \"While the rise in September was the largest since January, subdued spending for most of 2023 means that underlying growth in retail turnover remains historically low .\" So what does this mean for interest rates? According to the Commonwealth Bank, it's weighing favourably in the \"rate hike\" camp for the RBA. \"Aussie retail sales rose at a solid pace in September, beating market estimates, suggesting that an interest rate hike could come as soon as next week, \" CBA economist Craig James said. \"The 0.9% lift in consumer spending last month was the biggest since January, suggesting that p essimistic Aussie households are continuing to spend, withstanding higher borrowing costs and persistent price pressures. \"The bottom line is that high deposit rates and the strong Aussie job market are still supporting consumption. \"While slowing consumption and the lagged effect of previous rate hikes have been key factors in the Reserve Bank's five rate pauses this year, the unexpected strengthening in spending adds to the case for a potential resumption of the rate hiking cycle on November 7. \" But it's not all bad news, according to Tom Kennedy from JP Morgan. \"We expect these factors will deliver a temporary/one-off boost with the pace of sales growth to slow in coming months ,\" he said. \"The retail survey is skewed toward goods spending and overlooks much of the services sector (save for restaurant/cafes) where consumption has proven more resilient.\" \"As such we expect broader measures of household consumption to outpace the retail data, albeit still show signs of moderation as higher borrowing costs and diminished savings buffers weigh on discretionary spending.\"",
