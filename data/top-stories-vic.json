Just down the road from the ABC's Jerusalem bureau is a handwritten sign strung up outside someone's house. In Hebrew it reads: \"First, release the hostages.\" It's a sentiment shared by many people in Israel. Some families of the hostages say they would have preferred that Israel's government negotiates the release of their loved ones before escalating their ground incursion in Gaza. Among those missing are Tal and Adi Shoham, their son Naveh and daughter Yahel. Tal's dad Gilad Korngold says he trusts the Israeli army to make the right decisions, though three weeks into this crisis, he's struggling to hold onto hope. \"There was a lot of hope. Now [there's] less. Every day with no signs from them, it's terrible,\" he said. A military liaison stays in regular contact with Gilad, but he says they came up with an arrangement that helps him get through the night without lying there waiting for the phone to ring. \"He is coming three times a week to my house to talk to us, but we agreed that if something terrible happened, he will not call me up that night.\"",

We would continue to publicly assert that Israel should abide by these,” she said. “We have seen a devastating loss of innocent life. There are ongoing civilian deaths … you’ve seen the international response. The reality is the international community won’t accept ongoing civilian deaths. “So when friends like Australia urge Israel to exercise restraint and protect civilian lives it is really critical that Israel listens.\" Pressed on whether she would condemn Israeli air strikes on Gaza's Jabalia refugee camp, which the United Nations Human Rights Office has expressed could amount to war crimes, Senator Wong reiterated Australia’s position is to urge Israel to protect civilian lives and observe international law. “We want you to exercise restraint because this matters for those innocent civilians who should not be paying for those atrocities of Hamas who does not represent the Palestinian people,” she said. Wong says the Australian government is supporting those families and Australian citizens who got out overnight, and will keep working to ensure they get as many Australians out as possible.",

The Israeli Defense Force's (IDF) high command had difficulty getting a picture of what was going on because the militants had simultaneously attacked all the military outposts along the border, including the headquarters of the Gaza Division. But within a few days, the estimate rose to 1,500 to 2,000 militants entering through 20 points across the 58-kilometre border fence. Now, after interrogating captured militants, the IDF has a clearer picture of the sheer scale of the attack. It estimates that some 3,000 members of Hamas's military wing infiltrated Israel through dozens of points along the border fence as well as by air (in the form of a paraglider) and sea. This number does not include Gazan civilians who crossed through the torn down fence at about 11am in the second mass wave, some of whom killed people, took hostages and looted. By the time Israel regained control two days later, the security forces had killed 1,000 militants and captured 200. The rest either managed to return to the Gaza Strip or their bodies are still laying around the Israeli border communities. The IDF expects to finish collecting the militants' bodies in the coming days after making sure they aren't booby-trapped.",

Lending in that category over the last three months is 27.7per cent lower than the same quarter last year. The Housing Industry Association's senior economist, Tom Devitt blames the Reserve Bank's interest rate hiking cycle. \"Lending activity has been weighed down by the fastest increase in interest rates in a generation. This is drying up the pipeline of new home building work across the country.\" He warns it means there will be fewer new housing starts next year. \"There are very long lags in this cycle due to the record high volume of building work that was in the pipeline when the RBA first raised rates in May 2022. The volume of houses under construction only started declining in the June quarter of 2023, and remains elevated, a year after the first increase in the cash rate. \"This large volume of building work has obscured the impact of these rate rises on the broader economy, especially unemployment, as the building industry employs over one million Australians.\" Mr Devitt ended with this warning: \"This slowdown in lending for new housing will make it increasingly difficult to reach the Australian government's target of building 1.2 million new homes in five years.\"",

Trade numbers for September are out from the ABS and there's both bad and good news in the numbers. The bad news is that Australia's trade surplus dropped by nearly $3.4 billion to just shy of $6.8 billion. That's the lowest it's been since March 2021. The good news is that Australia is still posting an historically large trade surplus, and also that the reason it shrank is not so much to do with a fall in exports, which were down just 1.4%, but rather a surge in imports (up 7.5%). The good news on imports is twofold. First, it shows demand for goods hasn't completely collapsed — although the 0.3% rise for consumption goods is pretty tiny when you consider how much inflation is pushing up prices, so the volume of consumer goods imports must surely have fallen. The better news is that imports were driven higher by a 23.3% jump in capital goods coming into the country, mainly industrial transport equipment. That is hopefully a sign that businesses are following through with investment plans, and capital goods imports should (in theory at least) be productivity enhancing. But there is another bit of bad news in the data, about what it might mean for Australia's economic growth as measured by GDP and whether we can avoid a technical recession. This from Marcel Thieliant, head of Asia-Pacific at Capital Economics. \"The slump in the trade balance in September increases the risk that the Australian economy entered a recession in the third quarter, but we suspect that a large drag from net trade will have been offset by stock building and a modest rise in domestic demand,\" he writes. \"We now estimate that net trade knocked off 1.5%-pts from Q3 GDP growth, which would be one of the largest drags from net exports ever recorded. \"But we suspect that will be mostly offset by a reversal of the unusually large 1.1%-pts drag from inventories in the second quarter. \"So while today's data increase the risk that the recession we expect to start this quarter already begun last quarter, we suspect that the economy will have continued to expand in Q3.\" Of course, in per person terms, Australia is already in a recession, with GDP per capita having fallen 0.3% in both of the first two quarters this calendar year.",
