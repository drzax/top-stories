              "plaintext": "All four of the major banks are tipping a rate hike by the RBA today — but what's behind their thinking? Luci Ellis, who was an assistant governor with the RBA until taking up the job with Westpac, says the central bank is having to consider whether it's comfortable with inflation taking longer than it expected to come back down. \"Inflation simply isn't coming down as quickly as the Reserve Bank thought, so they've had to do a little bit more, or at least we expect they will,\" she told 7.30. \"As long as we keep getting upside surprises on inflation, they will be asking themselves the question about how much more they need to do .\" Given how resolute the markets are when it comes to a hike today, Ms Ellis said it could prove a challenge for the RBA if they decide to pause. \"I think the fact that markets are expecting it so strongly, does make it difficult for communication if they were to hold rates,\" she said. \"They would have to have a very clear explanation about how they think inflation is still going to get back into their 2 to 3% target range by mid-2025.\" Even with RBA governor Michele Bullock telling a conference last month that the central bank wouldn't hesitate to raise rates if there was a \"material\" change to inflation — before inflation came in hotter than the RBA's forecasts — Ms Ellis said the devil was in the detail. \"I think everybody's entitled to interpret the data as they would like. There could be an argument that it's not material, certainly our team was expecting something only a little below what actually happened, but the detail of the data didn't look good ,\" she said. \"There are a number of areas where inflation pressures are still much stronger than the Reserve Bank would like and realistically, it's hard to say that it's immaterial, given where they were three months ago .\" Australia's resilient property market, seen with higher property prices, are also challenging. \"It's not what you'd expect, given the movements in interest rates,\" Ms Ellis said. \"But population pressures, and the fact that household size declined during the COVID period, and is yet to reverse that out. \" These things seemed to have added enough to demand that both rents and prices are really increasing rapidly at the moment.\"",

But the Israeli leader reiterated his country's rejection of a ceasefire without the release of all people being held captive in the Hamas-ruled Palestinian enclave. Mr Netanyahu made the comments in an interview with the US ABC News. \"Well, there'll be no ceasefire, no general ceasefire in Gaza without the release of our hostages,\" he said. \"As far as tactical little pauses — an hour here, an hour there — we've had them before. \"I suppose we'll check the circumstances, in order to enable goods, humanitarian goods, to come in, or our hostages, individual hostages, to leave.\" He was also asked who should govern Gaza after fighting is over. \"I think Israel will for an indefinite period ... have the overall security responsibility because we've seen what happens when we don't have that security responsibility,\" he said. Both Israel and Hamas have rebuffed mounting international pressure for a ceasefire. Israel says Hamas should release the hostages first; Hamas says it will not free them or stop fighting while Gaza is under assault. Reuters",

Israel's military and police said the four were part of a West Bank cell that was directed by Hamas and who were behind numerous shooting attacks. The Palestinian Health Ministry said they were killed in the western West Bank city of Tulkarm, close to the boundary with Israel, after Israeli forces opened fire on their car. In a separate incident, the ministry said an 18-year-old Palestinian was later killed by Israeli forces in the West Bank city of Bethlehem. Prior to the latest incidents, at least 155 Palestinians had been killed in the West Bank since October 7, according to Palestinian Health Ministry figures. The worsening violence comes after more than 18 months of bloodshed that has fuelled fears the West Bank could erupt into a bigger conflict and become a new front in the Israel-Hamas war. An Israeli border police officer was killed in Jerusalem earlier after she was stabbed by a 16-year-old Palestinian attacker, according to the police. Reuters",
