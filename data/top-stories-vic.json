Local police said a 911 caller reported an active shooter in the Capitol district about 2:30pm local time (4:30am AEST). Officers were on the scene “within seconds”, searching the Senate office buildings and telling political staffers inside to shelter in place. But the local police chief has just held a press conference, where he said they found no signs of a shooting or a shooter. He said local police and partner agencies such as the Secret Service were “prepared for whatever might happen tomorrow”. Mr Trump is scheduled to appear in court at 4pm local time (6am AEST), but it’s not known if he will show up in person or dial in virtually. The courthouse is about a 10-minute walk from the Capitol building, which was stormed by Trump supporters on January 6, 2021.",
