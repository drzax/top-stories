The Australian share market is currently at a seven-week high, and likely to start the day higher (with SPI futures up 0.2%). That's despite an overnight fall on European markets and Wall Street being closed for the Juneteenth public holiday (commemorating the emancipation of African Americans from slavery). Investors are looking out for the Reserve Bank meeting minutes, which are out at 11:30am AEST. They will provide greater detail on why the RBA decided to lift the cash rate target to 4.1% earlier this month (a decision which surprised markets). Later today, the RBA's deputy governor Michele Bullock will give a speech on \" Achieving Full Employment \", at an event hosted by the Australian Industry Group in Newcastle. Overseas, investors are looking closely at China as there's speculation our biggest trading partner will pump more stimlus into its slowing economy. The People's Bank of China is expected to cut its benchmark loan prime interest rates today, following a similar reduction in medium-term lending rates last week.",
