Yesterday Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu raised the prospect of Israel taking control of the administration of the Gaza Strip once Hamas is defeated. \"Clearly Israel is going to have to exercise ultimate security control over the Gaza strip, because we saw what happened when we don't,\" Eylon Levy, spokesperson for the Israeli government, told Patricia Karvelas on RN Breakfast when asked to comment on Netanyahu's words. He said he could not go into detail on what \"ultimate security control\" would mean, but said the Gaza Strip would have to be demilitarised. The last 20 years since Israel withdrew its troops and settlers from the Gaza Strip were a \"failed experiment\", he said. When asked by about US officials' comments against an Israeli occupation of Gaza, Levy elaborated: \"When we talk about ultimate security for the Gaza strip, we are not talking about Israeli soldiers necessarily patrolling inside and being there all the time. \"We're going to need mechanisms and safeguards to ensure that the area is not taken over by terrorists the way that it has been over the last 20 years.\" Listen to the full interview on ABC RN Breakfast below.",
