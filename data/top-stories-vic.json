In the 14 weeks from July 1 to October 1 this year, Woolworths has seen a 5.3% increase in its total group sales compared to the same time last year. In dollar values, that comes in at $17.2 billion. It's slightly less than what analysts had predicted (they thought there'd be a 5.5% increase) but CEO Brad Banducci says it's a \"solid\" result in light of inflation moderating. He says deflation for fruits, vegetables and meats has led to lower input costs, which have led to \"lower retail prices\" in its food businesses (that is, its supermarkets). \"Looking ahead, we have strong plans in place for the key Christmas and holiday trading period,\" he said. \"While sales trends in October have remained broadly in line with the trend lines in Q1, the trading environment remains uncertain and value for money remains a key focus for our customers across all our businesses. \"Keeping our team safe and helping all our customers have an inspirational and affordable festive season remains our top priority .\" The release of Woolworths' first quarter results comes ahead of their AGM tomorrow morning.",

The federal government charges 49 cents a litre on petrol purchased at the bowser, as part of a fuel excise. The previous Coalition government temporarily halved the tax in March last year for six months, after Russia's invasion of Ukraine caused a massive global spike in oil prices. The current government opted not to extend the excise cut when it expired last September, with government estimates suggesting the temporary cut resulted in about $5.6 billion of lost tax revenue during those six months. But when asked today if the government was looking at reducing the excise to ease cost-of-living pressures, Mr Chalmers said it's currently not on the table. \"Obviously in future budgets we will contemplate what measures are necessary in our economy consistent with our strict approach to fiscal discipline,\" he replied. \"But it's not something we have been working on now.\"",

Fuel was by far the biggest factor, but there's plenty more contributing to the increase — so let's break them down. What were the most significant contributors? Fuel prices, up 7.2% (The highest quarterly rise since March 2022) Electricity, up 4.2% Insurance, up 2.3% Rents, up 2.2% (Annual rental prices rose 7.6%, the largest increase since 2009) New house purchases, up 1.3% What was behind their increases? Fuel: Higher global oil prices Electricity: Higher wholesale prices being passed onto customers since July, partially offset by Energy Bill Relief rebates from July Insurance: Higher premiums for house, house contents and motor vehicle insurance Rents: Low vacancy rates, but moderated by increases in Commonwealth Rent Assistance New house purchases: Builders passing on labour and material costs Were there any falls? Yes — there were offsets during the September quarter for child care, fruit and vegetables, and domestic holiday travel and accommodation Child care fell 13.2%, after changes to the Child Care Subsidy increased the amount received by more than a million families in July Fruit and vegetables saw price falls of 3.7% because of favourable growing conditions Domestic holiday travel and accommodation fell 2.5% as there were no school holidays in August, reducing demand for airfares and accommodation It's also worth pointing out that the ABS says those significant contributors to inflation could have seen even higher increases had there not been support measures in place. The ABS's head of price statistics, Michelle Marquardt, says the rent assistance reduced the overall rent increases by 0.3%, while electricity prices would have increased 18.6% in the September quarter without the Energy Bill Relief rebates. Similarly, childcare prices would have increased 6.7% without the Child Care Subsidy reducing out-of-pocket costs for households.",
