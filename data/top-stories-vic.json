The Fair Work Commission (FWC) recommended an increase in certain allowances for employees, and said a committee would be set up to work over the next three months to list the skills required for staff to become eligible for promotions. Employees should also be paid to travel to attend training sessions, and Chevron must pay for their flights and accommodation if required, the commission said. Commissioner Bernie Riordan said \"I strongly recommend that the parties adopt the recommendations … which will hopefully resolve these disputes.\" \"In my view, the parties are close to achieving their desired outcome of registered enterprise agreements to cover the wages and employment conditions,\" Riordan said in the filing. \"It would be a pity and very frustrating to simply throw out these agreed positions and have the parties return to their respective logs of claims for any future arbitration.\" Chevron and the unions said they would review the recommendations. The two sides have until 9am AEST on Friday to decide whether to accept the commission's recommendations.",

                "plaintext": "It's been several weeks now that about 500 workers at Chevron's liquefied natural gas (LNG) Wheatstone and Gorgon facilities in Western Australia's north have been negotiating a new agreement. Workers are into their second week of industrial action, including 24 hour stoppages. Both parties have been fronting the Fair Work Commission to try to strike a deal. But talks yesterday ended without a deal, with a Chevron spokesperson saying it's now up to a workplace tribunal to map a way forward. Chevron Australia said despite \"meaningful negotiations\" this week, unions at the Wheatstone and Gorgon facilities, which export about 7 per cent of global LNG, continued to ask for terms well above industry standards. \"The ongoing lack of agreement reinforces our view that there is no reasonable prospect of agreement between the parties, \" the Chevron spokesperson said. A spokesman from the offshore Alliance - the union representing the Chevron workers sent through this statement. \"The negotiations before the Commissioner were useful and resulted in some concessions on both sides. However, the Offshore Alliance and its members want to secure an enterprise agreement that locks in industry standard terms and conditions and the offer made by Chevron at the conclusion of the negotiations failed to meet that standard. \"Offshore Alliance members remain open to compromise, but Chevron must table an offer that doesn't have Chevron providing lesser terms and conditions of employment to its employees when compared to other employers in the sector.\" The Fair Work Commission, will meet on Friday to review the dispute.",
