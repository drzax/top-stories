Human rights organisations, including Amnesty International, are also urging the international community to do more to ensure civilians are not targeted in the ongoing Israel-Gaza conflict. Speaking to Nour Haydar on AM, Amnesty International Australia campaigner Nikita White said the organisation has collected what they say is evidence of human rights abuses taking place in the days since the latest conflict began. \"We know there is always reluctance from the government to name war crimes at times. But there is evidence mounting of war crimes … and we want the Australian Government to understand that when organisations like Amnesty call something a war crime, there is a lot of thought that's gone into this,\" she said. The Australian Palestine Advocacy Network is another signatory to the statement with group president Nasser Mashni saying it was time for politicians in Canberra to stand up and demand an end to the bombardment which was affecting more than 2 million people. But CEO of the Executive Council of Australian Jewry has criticised human rights groups, saying they needed to be stronger in the criticism of Hamas and now was not the time to end military action.

Ms O'Neil has urged Australians in Israel to leave on this last planned flight. \"Don't assume that there will be continuous options to leave. If you want to leave, there is a flight leaving today, please get on it,\" she said. Forty-six Australians in Gaza have registered with the government to leave the war-torn area. \"What we need to understand here is that Gaza is effectively locked off, \"There are 2 million people living in a tiny plot of land with only one entry and exit point that is currently not open,\" she says. Ms O'Neil says the government is trying \"incredibly hard\" to get more information about the Australians in Gaza and is working on a plan to get them out.",
