One of the cars was hit directly and burst into flames, the report said. One woman and three girls, ages 10, 12 and 14 were killed, and others were wounded, it added. Samir Ayoub, the Lebanese journalist, who was in the car in front of the one that was struck, told the AP that the three girls killed were his sister's children and the woman was their grandmother. Israel's military said its troops engaged a vehicle \"identified as a suspected transport for terrorists\" in Lebanon on Sunday, and it was looking into reports there were civilians inside. Shortly after, Hezbollah said its fighters had fired Grad rockets from southern Lebanon into Israel in response. A number of rockets hit the northern Israeli town of Kiryat Shmona Sunday, Israeli rescue services said. At least one civilian was killed Sunday, the Israeli military said, but it wasn't immediately clear if it was in the Kiyat Shmona attack or an earlier one. AP/Reuters",

              "plaintext": "Westpac has posted a bumper full-year profit and announced a $1.5 billion share buyback. The bank announced a $7.2 billion full-year net profit, up 26% on the previous financial year. Westpac's financial year runs to September 30, as does ANZ's and NAB's, which will be reporting their full-year results soon. The profit came on the back of a 5% increase in loans to $773 billion and a 2% rise in net interest margin (NIM) — basically the gap between what the bank pays to borrow money and the rates it lends it out at — to 1.95%. Excluding one-off and financial market moves, \"core NIM\" on the bank's lending jumped 12 basis points to 1.87%. The bank also received a big boost from a 36% jump in non-interest income to $3.33 billion. Westpac's improved profit came from a 77% surge in profits from its business banking division and a 54% rise in earnings for its institutional bank. Profits from its consumer banking division fell 7% on reduced margins, while deposits grew 2.5 times as fast as loans. Despite high inflation across the economy, Westpac managed to reduce its costs by 1%. However, one negative was a near doubling in loan impairment charges to $648 million, or 0.09% of loans. The bank will pay a 72 cent a share final dividend, taking the full-year payout to $1.42. The company will also return money to shareholders through buying back $1.5 billion of its shares .",

And we're back to the now common contradiction where bad news for the economy is good news for stocks. On Friday, US non-farm payroll data showed unemployment ticked up to 3.9% in October — it was just 3.4% as recently as April. \"History shows that if the unemployment rate rises half a percentage point, the economy tends to end up in a recession,\" observed NAB's senior FX strategist Rodrigo Catril. The rise in unemployment came off the back of a smaller-than-expected 150,000 increase in jobs, with more labour supply due to increased migration into the US. The data also showed a more than 200,000 increase in the number of workers who lost their job or finished a temporary contract last month. But rather than have markets worried about a recession and falling corporate profits, they rejoiced because it added weight to the narrative the US Federal Reserve is now done raising interest rates. The benchmark S & P 500 index gained 0.9% and the Nasdaq did even better. The US dollar sank, so that the Australian dollar is now back above 65 US cents for the first time since August. The Australian share market is set for a more muted gain, with the key ASX 200 futures index up just 0.2% to 7,000 points .",
