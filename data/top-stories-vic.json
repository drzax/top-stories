The AER alleges the subsidiaries — AGL Macquarie and AGL Loy Yang — made offers to the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) and were paid to be on standby to provide contingency \"frequency control ancillary services\" (FCAS) in response to disturbances. The AER says both subsidiaries admitted to not complying with dispatch instructions given to them by AEMO regarding their FCAS offers, and failed to ensure their relevant generating units were able to comply with them. \"Under the National Electricity Rules, electricity generators can offer to be on standby to  provide market ancillary services to stabilise network frequency when there is a power  system disturbance,\" the AER said. \"Contingency FCAS is a type of market ancillary service and is essential  to keeping the lights on following a frequency disturbance in the power system.\" The AER alleges AGL Macquarie failed to comply with the instructions between September 2018 and August 2020 at its Bayswater power station, and between December 2019 and May 2020 at AGL's Loy Yang A power station. Both subsidiaries have cooperated with the AER, and the regulator says the parties intend to make joint submissions to the Federal Court.",
