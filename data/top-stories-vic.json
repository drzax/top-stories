In a statement the military said its fighter jets had struck a Hamas command and control complex in Jabalia \"based on precise intelligence\", killing the head of the Islamist group's anti-tank missile unit, Muhammad A'sar. \"Hamas deliberately builds its terror infrastructure under, around and within civilian buildings, intentionally endangering Gazan civilians,\" the statement said. There was no immediate word on possible casualties from the second explosion. It comes a day after Palestinian health officials said an Israeli air strike had killed about 50 people and injured 150 at Jabalia. Palestinians sifted through rubble in a desperate hunt for people trapped underneath after Wednesday's strike on the camp. \"It is a massacre,\" one witness of the strike said. Israel has said Tuesday's strike on the same camp killed Ibrahim Biari, who it said was a ringleader of what it called the \"murderous terror attack\" on October 7. Reporting by Reuters",

Today, for the first time since the Israel-Gaza war broke out, the Rafah border crossing was opened for foreign passport holders to leave. But Horn says some Australians are still stuck inside the seaside enclave: \"The Australian authorities have confirmed to us that 23 people registered to them, including 20 Australians, have successfully now crossed over from Gaza into Egypt. \"They say those people are now being assisted with onward travel, but, of course, that means that there are dozens of Australians who are still stuck inside Gaza. \"I spoke with one man today who actually tried to go to the Rafah crossing today. He went there with his wife. He is an Australian passport holder. His wife has an Australian visa. \"He said when he went to Rafah, because his wife didn't have an Australian passport, they were told that they were not allowed to cross.\" Horn says she also spoke to Australians who haven't even been able to make the journey to the Rafah crossing because it was too dangerous or they couldn't find any transport.",
