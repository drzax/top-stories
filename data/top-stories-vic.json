The 46-year-old was unveiled today as the new Tigers coach, after narrowly beating interim coach Andrew McQualter to the job. Yze has tasted premiership success as an assistant coach with both Hawthorn and Melbourne. He says he wasn't deterred from applying for the Richmond position, despite missing out on several senior coaching jobs including Essendon and the Giants last year. “We‘re not going to put a ceiling on where we can finish,” Yze says. “I get huge upside watching what other teams have done … not to say that that’s what we’re going to do but that’s what we’re going to strive to do. “I want our players walking into the footy club thinking that they can make the top four next year. We won’t put a ceiling on it. “There might be some bumps along the road and as a footy club we’ll be really strong during that period. Can’t wait to get started.”",

For my entire professional life, I have been engaged daily with news and ideas, and that will not change. But the time is right for me to take on different roles, knowing that we have truly talented teams and a passionate, principled leader in Lachlan who will become sole Chairman of both companies. Neither excessive pride nor false humility are admirable qualities.

We have every reason to be optimistic about the coming years - I certainly am, and plan to be here to participate in them.

In my new role, I can guarantee you that I will be involved every day in the contest of ideas. Our companies are communities, and I will be an active member of our community. I will be watching our broadcasts with a critical eye, reading our newspapers and websites and books with much interest, and reaching out to you with thoughts, ideas, and advice. When I visit your countries and companies, you can expect to see me in the office late on a Friday afternoon. I look forward to seeing you wherever you work and whatever your responsibility.

Figures from the AEC reveal almost 98 per cent of eligible Australians have registered to vote in the Indigenous Voice to Parliament referendum next month. A Voice to Parliament would act as an independent advisory body for First Nations people. Australian Electoral Commissioner, Tom Rogers, says the registration figures are a great result. \"It's criticial that all Australians have their chance to have their say,\" he says. \"Youth enrolment is at the highest rate its ever been for an electoral event and the same for estimated indigenous enrolment so it's a great outcome for all Australians and it means that it will be a solid event and a solid outcome.\" Rogers says the referendum vote is a huge logistical event. \"We'll be visiting well over 750 remote communities. I think last week we dispatched 160,000 ballot papers to our overseas missions - the largest in-person overseas vote that we've seen. \"Big postal process is underway. I think as of yesterday we've had something like about 1.2 million applications for postal votes.\"",

Offshore Alliance members from three Chevron gas facilities — Gorgon, Wheatstone Platform and Wheatstone Downstream — met at 7pm WA time to consider a recommendation put to both Chevron and Offshore Alliance members yesterday morning by Commissioner Riordan. The proposed enterprise agreements, which incorporate the commissioner's recommendations, contain substantial improvements in terms and conditions of employment including increased remuneration, job security, locked-in rosters, career progression and returning all employees to a 40 per cent roster. The Offshore Alliance will now work with Chevron to finalise the drafting of the three agreements and members will soon cease current industrial action. The Offshore Alliance is an alliance between The Australian Workers’ Union (AWU) and the Maritime Union of Australia (MUA). Offshore Alliance spokesperson, AWU WA secretary Brad Gandy, says Offshore Alliance members carefully considered Commissioner Riordan’s recommendation before endorsing it. “Commissioner Riordan’s recommendation contains substantial improvements in terms and conditions of employment, including increased remuneration, job security, locked-in rosters, career progression and returning all employees to a 40 per cent roster,” Mr Gandy says. “'The Offshore Alliance is a member-led union and at a late-night mass meeting members endorsed the latest offer, which incorporates the Fair Work Commission's recommendations. “The Offshore Alliance will now work with Chevron to finalise the drafting of the agreement and members will soon cease current industrial action.\"",
