              "plaintext": "Woolworths is facing more than 1,000 criminal charges in Victoria over allegations the firm failed to pay more than $1 million in long service leave to former employees. Wage Inspectorate Victoria alleges Woolworths and its subsidiary Woolstar underpaid 1,235 former employees their long service leave entitlements, with underpayments ranging from $250 to $12,000. The regulator alleges that Woolworths and Woolstar broke Victoria's Long Service Leave Act between 2018 and 2021. Failure to pay long service leave is a criminal offence in Victoria and attracts large fines. The case will begin in the Melbourne Magistrates' Court next month. Here's Robert Hortle, Victoria's Wage Inspectorate commissioner: \"Victorians expect businesses with significant payroll resources to get this stuff right. \"They’d be disappointed to see a household name facing underpayment allegations. \"Long service leave is a long standing, valued workplace entitlement in Victoria, and the Wage Inspectorate is here to ensure it is paid when it is owed. \"The amount of underpayment never tells the full story in long service leave matters.\" The Wage Inspectorate is also taking action against Optus, CommSec and Bank West alleging they broke the long service leave laws. In 2021, a Wage Inspectorate investigation found more than 4,000 former Coles workers in Victoria were underpaid almost $700,000 in long service leave entitlements.",

Shrinking manufacturing industries in China, the Eurozone and the US also weighed on sentiment. Manufacturing in the Eurozone contracted in July at the fastest pace since May 2020 because of dropping demand. The Australian market is down more 1 per cent in afternoon trade, and the Australian dollar has lost 0.5 per cent so far today, dropping below 66 US cents, after taking a tumble overnight. In Japan, the Nikkei 225 has fallen by 2 per cent as chip makers weigh on the benchmark index, tracking a fall on the Nasdaq. Investors are waiting for the reaction on Wall Street tonight after Fitch cut the US credit rating. Yields on US Treasury bonds fell on the news. The White House has slammed the move saying it \"strongly disagrees with this decision\". And US Treasury secretary Janet Yellen also took issue with Fitch's move. \"I strongly disagree with Fitch Ratings' decision. \"The change by Fitch Ratings announced today is arbitrary and based on outdated data. \"President Biden and I are committed to fiscal sustainability. \"The most recent debt limit legislation included over $1 trillion in deficit reduction and improved our fiscal trajectory. \"Looking forward, President Biden has put forward a budget that would reduce the deficit by $2.6 trillion over the next decade through a balanced approach that would support investments for the long-term.\" Congress agreed to a deal in June which suspended the nation's US31.4 trillion borrowing limit until January 2025. But Steven Ricchiuto, US chief economist at Mizuho Securities, says the US needs to cut spending. \"It's an unsustainable budget situation because the economy can't even grow its way out of this problem. \"Therefore, they're going to have to either tackle it or accept the consequences of potential further additional downgrades.\" with Reuters",
