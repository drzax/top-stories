The ASX 200 futures are pointing towards a modest decline on the local share market, down 0.2% at 7,043 points. That's also more than 50 points below where the ASX 200 index closed on Friday. NAB economist Taylor Nugent said the interest rate outlook is still the key driver of share moves. \"During the week, the BoE [Bank of England] and Norges Banks [Norway] increased rates by 50bp [basis points] amid inflation backdrops that continued to provide too little evidence of cooling. \"In the US, [Federal Reserve chair Jerome] Powell reiterated the June dots for two more hikes in front of lawmakers, but that FOMC baseline continues to be discounted by markets, which price just one hike for a peak in November. \"On Friday, Atlanta's Bostic, firmly at the dovish end of the FOMC spectrum, said that 'I'd be comfortable with the information I have today, staying right where we are and just staying here through the rest of this year and long into next year.' \"San Francisco's Daly said that two more quarter point hikes are a \"very reasonable projection\" but further emphasised that that outlook is conditional on the data flow, 'we are going to have to find the terminal rate by looking at the data.'\" Until it is totally clear that inflation is coming down and interest rates have definitely peaked, it seems there is more volatility in the offing.
