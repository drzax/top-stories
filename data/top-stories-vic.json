Being an invite-only lunch, the briefing is not flagged on the \"coming up\" section of the RBA website. How do I know about it? Only because I am on the AICC mailing list. Mr Lowe defended his appearance at the Barrenjoey lunch, saying nothing untoward occurred and telling a parliamentary committee \"I can't live in a bubble\". Mr Lowe told that committee that the bank would extend blackout periods to ensure that he didn't make such appearances between rates decisions and major policy statements from the RBA. That will not be the case this week, and Mr Lowe will deliver an address open to the media tomorrow morning at the Morgan Stanley Australia Summit, which the ABC will cover. The RBA does hold regular background and off the record conversations with market participants and the media, including the ABC. However, appearances at closed \"members only\" events are perhaps a poor look after a major review into the bank urged greater public transparency around its decision-making.",

RBA governor Philip Lowe even made a note of this when he appeared at Senate Estimates last week, and said the experiences of Australians were something they discussed in their monthly board meetings. But he said they had a tough job in having to stop rising inflation, which is hurting Australians, on top of increasing interest rates. \"I know higher interest rates are unpopular, they're hurting people, it's very tough,\" he said. \"In our board discussions, we look at the alternative. \"The end result [if inflation was not controlled] would be higher interest rates, more pain and higher unemployment. \"It's not a scare campaign, but we want people to understand its serious. \" Every single family is feeling those cost-of-living pressures, and that's because over the past year prices went up 7% and we have got to stop that. \"I know what we're doing is painful and it's very difficult for many people bit it's necessary.\"",
