Assistant Treasurer and Minister for Financial Services Stephen Jones has told ABC business reporter Nassim Khadem that it's possible that the matter will be referred to the Australian Federal Police for potential criminal investigations. \"We've got Treasury looking at an investigation into what has occurred, and looking at whether criminal charges should be referred to the AFP ,\" he said. \"We're all appalled with what's gone on with PwC. We want to send a very clear message to them, and anyone else who's providing services to government, that you cannot breach the trust of the government or the Australian people. \"So if criminal charges or other charges can be laid, we're looking forward to the outcomes of that investigation from Treasury.\" Nassim asked the minister whether the government might also hit PwC via its partners' hip pockets. \"And so are you reviewing current government contracts [with PwC]?\" \"The Finance Minister and Treasury are looking at all of the options that are available to us,\" Mr Jones responded. The ABC's business editor Ian Verrender had some strong analysis last week on the PwC scandal.",
