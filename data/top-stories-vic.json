Here's defence correspondent Andrew Greene : An Israeli government official has confirmed an unspecified number of Israeli-Australians have returned to the country to join its largest ever military mobilisation. In the past week some Australian citizens boarded an Israeli government facilitated flight out of Bangkok, while others have taken commercial flights to Ben Gurion International Airport. The Netanyahu government has called for more than 300,000 reservists to join the military operation against Hamas, following its deadly terror attacks against Israel last week. Israel’s ambassador to Australia Amir Maimon said the Hamas attack marked the beginning of a war, not just another cycle of violence in the Middle East. “This is a war we did not ask for or start but we are determined to win it,” the former military officer said.",

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu 's office also released graphic images on social media which showed dead children. Blinken, who flew into Tel Aviv earlier on Thursday, said he was shown images of \"a baby riddled with bullets, soldiers beheaded, [and] young people burned alive in their cars or in their highway rooms\". \"It's simply depravity in the worst imaginable way,\" Blinken told a news briefing. \"Images are worth a thousand words. These images may be worth a million.\" US President Joe Biden said on Wednesday that he had seen images of children beheaded by militants, but the White House later clarified that US officials had not seen direct evidence of this. Netanyahu has not repeated a claim by his office earlier this week that Hamas had cut off the heads of children, nor did Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant repeat that accusation to NATO ministers. But medics, international human rights organisations and journalists have documented that militants killed women, children and the elderly as well as young men and soldiers. ABC/Reuters",

Dr Stephen Gourley published the piece \" The Voice is an important part of reconciliation for Australia\" on ACEM's Your ED online newsletter. He said Central Australia is the epicentre of where you can see the gap in life expectancy for Indigenous Australians. \"What you see here is actually the, it strikes you right in the face about the what the gap actually means,\" he said. \"For example, we don't see a lot of geriatric patients. And the reason for that, sadly, is that people don't live long enough to become geriatric,\" he said. \"We see the diseases of poverty and overcrowding, such as bronchiectasis, trachoma, rheumatic heart disease and end-stage renal failure in people in their thirties – not in their sixties like you see on the east coast. \"Much of this is avoidable. It is primarily due to the complications of chronic skin infections in childhood, as well as crowded living conditions and poor access to showers and laundry, with scabies and lice endemic. \"I acknowledge that the Voice isn't supported by everybody, including Indigenous Australians. \"However, my thoughts on that, 'if not now, when?' This is such an important opportunity, and it's just too big an opportunity to miss.\"",

He said the Yes vote would start low on that basis, but then rise. \"What we will be watching for on the night is when does this stop rising, and I would expect with about 10 per cent of the votes counted in each state, the trend will solidify by that point,\" Mr Green told Background Briefing. He said he would be watching for the trend in the cities when those votes come in, with polling showing the Yes vote was higher in inner cities than the outer suburbs. \"No state will vote 'Yes' unless the capital city votes 'Yes', so we will be waiting for a good sample of votes from cities like Sydney and Melbourne, and then looking at where they are from in those two cities\" he said. \"If the result is as clear cut as some of the polls, then we should have a very early call in most states. \"I would say say one hour after the close of counting in each state, unless its close, we should be able to call each state.\"",

One of the arguments being put forward by the No campaign is that First Nations people already have a voice. No campaign group Fair Australia singles out the little known government agency, the National Indigenous Australians Agency (NIAA), as an existing voice. \"Indigenous Australians already have a voice through the NIAA,\" said No campaigner Damien Pace while handing out \"Vote No\" pamphlets in the inner-city suburb of Ultimo last week. The NIAA carries out government policy funding and implementing programs to improve the lives of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people around the country. Like any public service department or agency, it does provide advice to government, but that is not its main role. Yes23 co-chair Arrernte and Kalkadoon woman Rachel Perkins says it's a \"myth\" that the NIAA is a voice. Constitutional expert, Professor Cheryl Saunders from the University of Melbourne, agrees that the NIAA is not a voice to parliament. \"It's a completely different body to the Voice,\" she told the ABC. \"It doesn't give advice to the parliament, it's a body that advises government.\" Read more below:",
