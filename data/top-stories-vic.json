The terrorist group posted a video of the woman, identified as 21-year-old Israeli woman Mia Schem, to one of their social media channels earlier today. Mr Kirby said he believed it was a \"propaganda video\" from Hamas, telling NBC: \"There's no question in my mind that that woman gave that video testimony under duress, probably forced to do it. \"It's despicable, deplorable that they would take these hostages and then advertise how well they're treating them when they're the ones who hurt them in the first place.\" The young Israeli woman's mother has pleaded for her release, calling the seizure of hostages a \"crime against humanity\". \"I'm begging the world to bring my baby back home.

The Jordanian king told reporters earlier this evening: \"I think I can quite strongly speak on behalf of not only of Jordan as a nation, but our friends in Egypt: That is a red line â¦ no refugees in Jordan, no refugees in Egypt. \"This is a situation of humanitarian intervention that has to be dealt with inside of Gaza and the West Bank, and not to try and push the Palestinian challenge and their future onto other people's shoulders.\" King Abdullah made the comments at a press conference following a meeting with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz in Berlin. About 1 million Palestinians in Gaza may have been displaced from their homes since the beginning of the war, due to air strikes and the order to evacuate the northern part of the enclave, the United Nations said in an update posted earlier. More than 2 million registered Palestinian refugees already live in Jordan, according to United Nations data. ABC with Reuters and AP",
