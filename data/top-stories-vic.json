Disney stockholders have been scrutinising CEO Bob Iger's plans to turn around the entertainment giant, which announced price hikes to its streaming services, more ads, and significant cost cuts to try to boost its business. Investor sentiment led traders towards bearish bets with put options guarding against the stock slipping below $US80 between mid-September and mid-October. The put option gives traders the right to sell shares at a fixed price in the future. Disney was also dragged lower thanks to the weakness in the broader market, with investors increasingly cautious ahead of the Fed chair's speech. Iger has been up front about the entertainment company facing a \"challenging environment\" in the near term. Disney's stock closed at $US82.47 — the lowest price since October 16, 2014.",

The Federal Court proceedings have been launched against IAG's subsidiaries of Insurance Australia Limited (IAL) and Insurance Manufacturers of Australia (IMA). ASIC claims the insurers were misleading in encouraging loyalty discounts to entice customers to renew their home insurance policies, \"as loyal customers may have had their premiums increased before the discounts were applied\". IAL and IMA renewed more than 1 million home insurance policies, involving the SGIO, SGIC and RACV brands. \"We allege that IAG subsidiaries, IAL and IMA, misled their customers about the extent of the discounts they would receive,\" ASIC deputy chair Sarah Court said. \"The way they operated their pricing algorithm meant that some longer term or more loyal customers were allocated, or may have been allocated, higher premiums before the promised discounts were applied. \"There is a risk that loyal customers, having been promised a discount, were persuaded to stay with these companies, and in doing so lost their opportunity to shop around for a better price. \" ASIC also alleges between August 25, 2017 and August 24, 2023 : IAL made statements about its SGIO and SGIC branded home insurance policies on websites and in other documents that SGIO and SGIC customers would receive a 'Loyalty Discount' IMA made statements about RACV branded home insurance policies on websites and other documents that RACV customers would receive a 'Years of Membership Discount' and/or a 'Multi-Policy Discount', and IAG’s pricing algorithm operated inconsistently with their discount promises and therefore IAG failed to operate efficiently, honestly and fairly.
