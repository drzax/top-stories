              "plaintext": "Weak economic data from our largest trading partner China has led to a big fall in iron ore prices (Australia's biggest export to China). The spot price for the steelmaking material (62% iron) dropped to just over $US105 / tonne, its lowest level since June 1. Here's what Commonwealth Bank commodities analyst Vivek Dhar wrote in his latest note to clients: \"The demand concerns in China were highlighted by Rio Tinto’s chairman Dominic Barton, when he noted ‘there is a big real estate issue” in China. His comments underscore a deteriorating property sector that accounts for 35 - 40% of China’s steel demand. \"A number of property related indicators have turned south. New home price growth has begun to slow after peaking in March 2023. Property investment and property sales (in square metres) has started to contract sharply, falling 22%/yr and 20%/yr respectively in May. \"The most relevant indicator for steel demand and therefore the most important for iron ore prices is the drop off in China’s newly constructed floor space. \"This reflects the start of the construction process and where steel is mostly used. After dropping ~39%/yr in 2022, China’s newly constructed floor space has declined another ~23%/yr in the first five months of 2023.\" He also said the surprise slowdown in China’s consumer price index (CPI) to 0% in June highlights broader concerns for China’s economy: \"These concerns only increase the likelihood of policy support. And with Politburo’s semi annual economic conference due later this month, we expect policymakers will announce some support for the Chinese economy. \"The composition of the policy support will be crucial. Our expectation is that any policy support will be limited, particularly with China only targeting economic growth of 5% this year after growing only 3% in 2022. \"Since the early 1970s, China’s economy has lifted at least 7.5% after growing 3% or less the preceding year. \"Solving the issues of the property sector will be tricky given confidence and demand are so subdued following the fallout from property developer defaults and falling new home prices through 2022. \"As a result we think any support for the property sector will need to be longer and stronger than previous policies. Any stabilisation will therefore be more realistically realised next year.\"",

The benchmark stock index is on track to snap a four-day losing streak, with all major sub-indices in positive territory. The interest-rate sensitive financial sector advanced 1%, with the \"big four\" banks gaining between 0.5% and 1.4%. Meanwhile, traders awaited further economic stimulus from China - Australia's biggest trading partner - after data showed a slowing momentum in economic recovery with consumer spending also impacted. Mining giants BHP, Rio Tinto and Fortescue Metals rose over 1% each. Gold stocks gained 2.2% in their best day since July 3, with sector-majors Northern Star Resources and Newcrest Mining climbing 1.8% and 1.4%, respectively. Bellevue Gold, Capricorn Metals and De Grey Mining topped the ASX 200 chart with each surging above 5%.",

The Westpac-Melbourne Institute index of consumer sentiment rose 2.7% in July to 81.3 points, the biggest gain since April when rates were also kept on hold. However, any score below 100 points means the pessimists outnumbered optimists. The survey's measure of family finances compared to a year ago remained gloomy with a fall of 4.9%, reflecting cost of living pressures. \"The key message is that sentiment is probably not going to stage a sustained lift from current deeply pessimistic levels until inflation is much lower and interest rates are firmly on hold,\" said Westpac chief economist Bill Evans. The RBA held rates steady at 4.1% last week, in the middle of the survey period, but warned that it might have to hike again to bring inflation to heel. Monthly inflation data for May showed a welcome slowdown to 5.6%, but core price measures remained stubbornly high. In a positive sign for demand, the survey's measure of whether it was a good time to buy a major household item rose 3.1% in July, while its index buying dwellings jumped 6.2%.",
