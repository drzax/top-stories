Mobile services still working. — Chris Kewdale WA no internet service here. 07.00 Thurs. — Tony Optus NBN was restored yesterday around 12.30pm however went down again the morning at around 07.00 am and is yet to come back. Contacting Optus is proving to be impossible. — Timbo Service is out again in Deagon, QLD. I’d had been restored yesterday around 2pm and worked overnight. Dropped at 9am this morning and had been out since 1 — Jon Still no Optus NBN in Blackwood, Adelaide, SA. Modem restarted multiple times. I had to work from the local library yesterday, now hotspotting from my phone as I work from home. — Cathy Still no NBN service in Inner Southern suburb of Adelaide. Restarted the routers. Router is running off of backup sim card which can't handle the bandwidth. Tried to livechat with Optus support on the app but they've left me on 'read' for 10 minutes with zero reply so far. — Nic",

Today we're going to be focusing on the fallout of the Optus outage that brought some services and businesses to a halt — or, at the very least, made things difficult. The latest update from Optus was last night at precisely 6.32pm AEDT. Here's what the company's website says: The Optus Network has been restored and most services should now be back on line. Some customers may need to restart their device or turn flight mode on then off. Some NBN connections may not be restored as yet. Please try restarting your modem by turning it off, unplugging it for 30 seconds, and restarting. Our people are doing their best to respond to your concerns and Optus sincerely apologises for today’s outage. We again thank customers for their patience. We'll be bringing you all the updates as they come in this morning.",

The Palestinian Prisoners Association said Israeli forces arrested some 65 people across the West Bank on Wednesday, raising the number of Palestinians detained since October 7 to 2,280. There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military. It came as Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu met with leaders of Israeli settlements in the West Bank and denounced acts of sometimes-deadly vigilante violence committed by hard-line Israelis against Palestinian civilians. \"We are not prepared to tolerate it, we are not about to accept it, we will act against it in every way,\" Netanyahu said. He praised the settlers, who live in communities established by Israel on territory captured from Jordan in a 1967 war which are widely viewed as illegal under international law and on land Palestinians hope may one day be part of a future Palestinian state. Vigilante-style settler attacks have killed at least 29 people this year, according to the UN Humanitarian Affairs Office, OCHA. Reuters",

It comes after Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu suggested his country would maintain security control of Gaza for an \"indefinite period\" after its bombardment, which has killed 10,500 people in a month, according to Palestinian health authorities. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has laid out the most detail to date about America's vision for a post-war two-state solution. He said the \"key elements\" should include: No forcible displacement of Palestinians from Gaza. \"Not now, not after the war.\" No use of Gaza as a platform for terrorism No reoccupation of Gaza after the war No attempt to blockade or besiege Gaza It's \"clear that Israel cannot reoccupy Gaza\", Blinken said. \"We must also work on the affirmative elements to get to a sustained peace. These must include the Palestinian people's voices and aspirations at the centre of post-crisis governance in Gaza. It must include Palestinian-led governance, and Gaza unified with the West Bank under the Palestinian Authority.\" Mr Blinken's comments highlight a widening gap between the US and Israel on the longer-term goals for the region. None of the ideas that Israeli officials have raised for Gaza's governance after the war have included independent Palestinian rule as a credible possibility. Reporting with AP",

The report attributes no tax being paid to various reasons, including companies making an accounting loss or claiming tax offsets that reduced their tax bill to nil.
