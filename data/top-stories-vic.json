Its result was boosted by a $209 million gain on the sale of its international infrastructure equity business, while the previous year's first-half result was even more inflated by the sale of its real estate and domestic infrastructure business. Looking at only the businesses that AMP continues to operate, net profit came in at $52 million, down 45% from the previous first-half result. AMP said its underlying profit results were roughly in line with the first-half last year at $112 million. The company said its banking division saw a 24% rise in profit, while its investment platform saw underlying profits up nearly 26%. Its advice business posted a $25 million underlying loss, although AMP said this was smaller than last year. \"We have significantly reduced the size and complexity of AMP's business, whilst continuing to resolve legacy issues,\" said the financial firm's CEO Alexis George. \"We have outlined a target to deliver $120 million in run rate controllable cost savings by FY 25, with a $60 million reduction in FY 24 and a similar number for FY 25. \"This will be achieved through simplifying our technology architecture, removing stranded costs, reducing group costs including property, continued focus on the Advice business, replatforming our Master Trust business and a disciplined approach to project spend.\" Between divestments and cost-cutting, AMP is striving to shrink its way back to greatness.",

However, the company lamented some disappointing box office results for films including Elemental and the latest Indiana Jones adventure. It also reported another drop in subscriber numbers for Disney+ to 146.1 million, down 7.4%, mainly due to the loss of broadcasting rights for Indian Premier League cricket. The relevant Disney+ Hotstar product lost 24% of its users. Earnings per share were slightly higher on an adjusted basis, while revenue was a touch lower than typical forecasts. The broadcaster took $US2.65 billion in one-time write-downs and charges, which dragged it to a $US460 million net loss.",
