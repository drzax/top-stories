Here's a handful of updates from across the nation: In Brisbane and got our NBN back yesterday evening but we've lost it again this morning. Mobile services still working. — Chris Kewdale WA no internet service here. 07.00 Thurs. — Tony Optus NBN was restored yesterday around 12.30pm however went down again the morning at around 07.00 am and is yet to come back. Contacting Optus is proving to be impossible. — Timbo Service is out again in Deagon, QLD. I’d had been restored yesterday around 2pm and worked overnight. Dropped at 9am this morning and had been out since 1 — Jon Still no Optus NBN in Blackwood, Adelaide, SA. Modem restarted multiple times. I had to work from the local library yesterday, now hotspotting from my phone as I work from home. — Cathy Still no NBN service in Inner Southern suburb of Adelaide. Restarted the routers. Router is running off of backup sim card which can't handle the bandwidth. Tried to livechat with Optus support on the app but they've left me on 'read' for 10 minutes with zero reply so far. — Nic",

They understand it's an improvement.\" Mr Hagari added that there would be no ceasefire but Israel has been allowing for humanitarian pauses at specific times to give residents an opportunity to relocate south. Meanwhile, Hamas says its fighters had inflicted heavy losses, with the armed wing on Wednesday releasing a video that appeared to show intense street battles alongside bombed-out buildings in Gaza City. Israeli tanks have met heavy resistance from fighters using underground tunnels to stage ambushes, according to sources with Hamas and the separate Islamic Jihad militant group. One clip from the Hamas video released on Wednesday showed fighters running past piles of debris and stopping to fire shoulder-propelled missiles at Israeli tanks. Another showed them shooting rifles from perches behind buildings and dumpsters. Reuters was not able to authenticate the footage. Saleh al-Arouri, an exiled Hamas commander, told Hamas-affiliated Al-Aqsa TV that Israeli forces may gain control of some areas in Gaza. \"But that will not stop the resistance's fight against soldiers and tanks. The more (Israel) spreads and expands on the ground, the deeper its losses will become\", he said. Reuters",

WHO said that more than 33,551 cases of diarrhoea had been reported since mid-October, the bulk of them among children under five. It said the number of children affected marked a significant increase compared to an average of 2,000 cases monthly in that age group throughout 2021 and 2022. The lack of fuel has also disrupted the collection of solid waste, which WHO said created an \" environment conducive to the rapid and widespread proliferation of insects, rodents that can carry and transit diseases. \" It said that it was \" almost impossible\" for health facilities to maintain basic infection prevention measures, increasing the risk of infection caused by trauma, surgery and childbirth. \"Disrupted routine vaccination activities, as well as lack of medicines for treating communicable diseases, further increase the risk of accelerated disease spread,\" it warned. While there have been extremely limited deliveries of food, water and medicine to Gaza, Israel has refused to let fuel in due to concerns about its possible diversion by Hamas despite calls from the United Nations and humanitarian aid groups.

The border crossing has opened on many instances and allowed for the safe … exit for foreign nationals who have sought it,\" he said. Evacuations of foreign passport holders through the crossing were suspended on Saturday and Sunday after an Israeli strike on an ambulance that was heading to Rafah, but the crossing was open again on Monday and Tuesday. The US expects the Egypt-controlled crossing will be reopened at \"regular intervals\" so that aid can enter the Gaza Strip and foreign nationals can continue to depart, Mr Patel said. He said 81 trucks carrying food, medicine, health supplies, bottled water and hygiene products crossed into the strip on Tuesday, bringing to about 650 the total number of trucks that have crossed since a diplomatic agreement was reached to reopen the crossing on October 21.

Telkomsel, the Indonesian associate of Southeast Asia's largest telecom firm, had agreed to merge with its parent's IndiHome broadband arm in an effort to expand into Indonesia's fixed broadband market. The deal was expected to completed in the third quarter of 2023. SingTel owns a 29.6% stake in the enlarged integrated mobile and fixed broadband company. \"For Telkomsel, first-time contributions from IndiHome largely offset the impact of SingTel's reduced stake,\" the company said in a statement. It had earlier a 35% stake in Telkomsel. SingTel said its net profit for the six months ended September 30 was $S2.14 billion ($1.58 billion), compared with $S1.17 billion a year earlier. The company declared an interim dividend of 5.2 Singapore cents per share, higher than the 4.6 Singapore cents per share declared a year earlier.",
