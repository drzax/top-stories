It's latest outlook report says both apartments (last year) and detached houses (this year) will hit decade lows for building commencements. Here's what the report had to say: Slowing from a peak of 149,300 detached starts in 2021, new starts are expected to fall to just 95,370 detached houses in 2024, the lowest number since 2012. From a trough in mid-2024, detached starts are expected to growth modestly off the back of a solid economy and population growth to 110,820 by 2027. There were just 63,510 multi-unit commencements in 2022, a decade low, and only a small 9.7 per cent improvement to 69,680 is expected in 2023. Stronger improvements of 19.8 per cent, 11.6 per cent and 0.9 per cent are expected to bring the annual total back to a peak of 94,030 by 2026, before a moderation of 2.8 per cent back down to 91,360 in 2027. The HIA's chief economist Tim Reardon says better land release policies, reduced taxes and charges on developments, and an increase in spending on public housing construction would all assist the sector, as would a cut in interest rates. \"Even a decision to cut the cash rate today would not produce a recovery in house commencements until the second half of 2024,\" he argued. \"Exceptionally low rental vacancies, strong migration and low unemployment rates will ensure a return of investment into the construction of new houses and multi-units when the RBA stops its rate rising cycle and avoid a deeper downturn in the national economy.\"",

              "plaintext": "An unexpected rate cut by the People's Bank of China (PBOC), the second in three months, has helped boost the ASX. At a time when other central banks are still considering rate rises to tame inflation, Chinese authorities are battling deflation and a potential property crash, as one of the nation's largest developers now teeters on the brink. However, investors locally appear to have taken the rate cuts as a sign that Chinese authorities recognise the seriousness of the situation and are trying to avert a crisis. The ASX 200 index finished 0.4% higher at 7,305 points. Tokyo's Nikkei also closed in the black, up 0.6%, but Hong Kong's Hang Seng and the mainland Chinese markets were on track for modest losses. The healthcare sector dominated gains, with well-received results from Cochlear and market heavyweight CSL seeing them gain 5.7% and 3.7% respectively. Technology also fared well, climbing 0.9%. Despite the Chinese rate cuts, the basic materials (mostly mining) sector was one of the few in the red, with BHP down 0.3% and Rio Tinto 0.4%. Overall, 107 ASX 200 companies gained ground, with 85 down and 9 flat. Five biggest gains: Lake Resources: +16.7% to $0.245 GUD Holdings: +14.9% to $11.74 Life 360: +12.3% to $9.01 Sims: +6.3% to $15.85 Cochlear: +5.7% to $246.47 Five biggest losses: Syrah Resources: -5.2% to $0.645 Seek: -4.3% to $24.66 Gold Road Resources: -3.9% to $1.62 Sayona Mining: -3.9% to $0.125 Silver Lake Resources: -3.8% to $0.88",
