Chalmers was wary of answering, maintaining that the central bank must act independently, but said that the fight against high inflation isn't over despite it showing signs that it's moderating. \" Australians are under the pump, we are seeing the impact of the rate rises which are already in the system,\" he said. \"We are making welcome progress in the fight against inflation, but we're not there yet, and the Reserve Bank will weigh up the fact that inflation is moderating. \"We had a soft retail trade figure last week. \"They will weigh that all up in the usual way and they'll come to a decision whether rates go up or not.\" Karvelas pushed Chalmers for an answer on whether he thinks Australians could handle a potential rate rise after today's meeting, to which he acknowledged the past rises are hurting people. \"Put it this way, Patricia, the rate rises, which are already in the system, have made life harder for people. I mean, that's self evident,\" he said. \"And, you know, we have I've said probably the last half a dozen times that you and I have spoken that we understand that whether it's inflation, which has been higher than we'd like for longer than we'd like, whether it is these interest rate rises over the last, since before the election last year, whether it's the global economic uncertainty, it's putting people under pressure and slowing our economy already, we're already seeing the impact of the rate rises, which are in the system. \"We're seeing that in a heap of data that we've been getting in the last few weeks or months, the Reserve Bank will weigh that up, and they'll come to a decision independently.\"",

The Stoxx600 and FTSE picked up 0.1% thanks to some very positive economic data. Economic growth (or GDP) in Europe was higher than expected, picking up 0.6% for the year — better than the 0.5% expectation economists had predicted. Headline inflation also fell more than analysts were expecting, down to 5.3% from 5.5%. It's very welcome news for the European Central Bank, which just last week said it is considering ending its latest run of severe rate hikes. Although 5.3% is a way away from the ECB's 2% target, the downwards trajectory can help policymakers with the argument that inflation is moderating and they can afford to skip another rate rise at its next meeting. Interestingly though, inflation in services has remained stubborn, increasing to a 5.6% annual rise in June — which can likely be attributed to growth in wages and a surge in travel and entertainment spending post-COVID. (Services inflation is also the big sticking point for inflation here in Australia — but more on that a bit later.)",
