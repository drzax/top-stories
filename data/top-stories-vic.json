Woodside Energy's chief executive Meg O'Neill has told Reuters it is proceeding with respect in its talks with unions to avert industrial action at Australia's largest LNG facility, the North West Shelf. O'Neill told Reuters in an interview: \"It takes two to tango. \"We are proceeding with goodwill and with respect, and we are very focused on really understanding the key areas of concern. \"But we also of course, have a duty to our shareholders to be able to run the business.\" The Offshore Alliance (OA), which represents LNG workers, said in a Facebook post that the cost for Woodside of not sorting out an agreement will be \"infinitely greater\" than any strikes. \"It's time that Woodside's operations workforce got their fair share of the profits which they generate for the Woodside shareholders.\" \"The OA member are primed and ready to go.\" Tomorrow is the deadline for Woodside to respond to the union's bargaining claims. Industrial action could start early next month. Industrial action would disrupt Australia's LNG exports, which represent about 10 per cent of global supply. Workers at Chevron's Wheatstone and Gorgon offshore platforms are also voting on industrial action over similar wage demands. Gas prices rose across Europe and Asia on the uncertainty.",
