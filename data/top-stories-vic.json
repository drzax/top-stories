Officials in Boston had insisted as recently as yesterday that they were still hopeful of finding the five people onboard the submersible alive. With those hopes dashed, attention now turns to what comes next. Remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) will continue to search the area where the debris has been found, in an attempt to help investigators work out what might have gone wrong. But the Coast Guard could not say whether there was any chance of recovering any of the passengers' bodies. The size of the international press pack attending the Coast Guard's daily updates has grown substantially throughout the week, pointing to the global level of interest in the unfolding search operation. Sadly, it has not ended in the way rescuers or the families on board had been desperately wishing for.",

He says the diving community is small and that he had known French diver Paul-Henri Nargeolet for 25 years. \"For him to die tragically in this way is almost impossible for me to process.\" Cameron has completed 33 deep sea dives to the historic wreck, saying he's \"spent more time on the ship than the captain did.\" \"I also designed and built a sub to go to the deepest place in the ocean, three times deeper than the Titanic, so I understand the engineering and safety problems associated with building this type of vehicle,\" he adds.",
