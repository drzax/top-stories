As we approach 1:30pm AEST, the ASX is down 0.8% to 7,137 points. Locally, only the academic services and utilities sectors are in positive territory — although the gains for both are incredibly slim. Healthcare and industrials have shed 1.5% each, while financials is down 1.3%. Combined with an Aussie dollar staying below 64 US cents on the back of the unemployment data, the ASX is down nearly to 3% compared to where it finished up last Friday. The top movers so far are: Inghams +14.4% IPH +9.7% Orora +8.4% Abacus Storage King +4.3% Super Retail Group +4.1% As for the bottom movers: Core Lithium -23.4% Lake Resources -7.5% Domain Holdings -7.1% Polynovo -6.8% NRW Holdings -6.4%",
