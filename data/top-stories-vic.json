The Bank of Korea board voted to keep its policy rate unchanged at 3.50 per cent, as both inflation and economic growth eased. The central bank started raising interest rates in August 2021 to tame inflation, well before the world's other major central banks, and had raised them by a total of 300 basis points through January this year. Capital Economics senior Asia economist Gareth Leather said: \"we don't think it will be long before the [Korea's] central bank starts cutting interest rates\". \"With inflation falling back, the economy struggling and the housing market downturn deepening, we think the BoK will start loosening monetary policy in August, earlier than when others are expecting. \" \"The main reason we think the central bank will start loosening policy soon is the weakness of the economy. GDP grew by just 0.3 per cent in Q1 following a 0.4 per cent contraction in the final quarter of last year. He said pressures were also continuing to ease. \"The headline rate has fallen from a peak of 6.3 per cent in July 2022 to 3.7 per cent in March, which is the lowest reading in over a year.\" \"Overall, we are expecting 75 basis points worth of rate cuts this year, with the first cut likely to be in August.\" He noted that in contrast, most other analysts are expecting either very modest cuts, or for interest rates to be left unchanged this year.",
