There is also $300 million for housing, including plans for more than 1,400 affordable dwellings by the financial year 2039-40. Another $5 million has been allocated toward a 12-month consultation process for a \"pathway to Treaty\" with First Nations peoples. More from Isobel: This budget focuses spending on schools, hospitals and public sector wages — almost all of which had already been announced before today's budget. It includes: •\t$13.8 billion into health facilities, including new money for Fairfield Hospital Redevelopment and $400 million for the new Rouse Hill Hospital, on top of $300 million committed by the previous Coalition government. •\t$9.8 billion for schools and educational facilities •\t$72.3 billion into transport projects, including the Sydney Metro West and the Sydney Metro — Western Sydney Airport connection •\t$3.2 billion for disaster relief and recovery programs •\t$2.2 billion for a Housing and Infrastructure Plan A previously announced review into the viability and cost of the Sydney Metro is due to be given to government by the end of the year, the budget documents said. As part of the Housing and Infrastructure Plan, there is $300 million for publicly owned company Landcom housing to deliver \"an additional 1,409 affordable homes and 3,288 market homes to 2039-40.\" The budget papers show in addition to another affordable housing program, the state will build about 9,300 new social, affordable and private homes in the next 16 years. But Mr Mookhey expected 3000 of those to be built by the end of the decade. Mr Mookhey blamed the previous government for contributing to the housing crisis. \"If we had built more homes in the last decade we would have more homes in this decade,\" he said. Some smaller expenses are also notable. There is $5 million towards a 12-month consultation towards a \"pathway to Treaty\" with First Nations Australians.",
