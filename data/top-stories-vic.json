China's National Bureau of Statistics says consumer prices dropped 0.3 per cent in July from a year ago, the first decline since February 2021. That's because of lower prices for food and consumer goods. However, the monthly Consumer Price Index rose 0.2 per cent from June. Producer prices, the prices received by producers for their goods, fell for the tenth month in a row, down 4.4 per cent from a year ago. Trade figures out yesterday showed that Chinese imports and exports slumped from July last year. China's economy is slowing down after the end of COVID restrictions earlier in the year boosted the economy.

But it warns that a \"soft landing is possible but not certain\" for the economy as the Reserve Bank tries to bring inflation down to its target of between 2 to 3 per cent. \"The key risk to a soft-landing scenario is that inflation is more sticky than generally expected and the Reserve Bank of Australia has to hike interest rates more strongly.\" \"That could cause a sharper economic downturn and larger rise in unemployment.\" S & P Asia Pacific chief economist Louis Kuijs says the RBA's decision to pause official rates at 4.1 per cent shows it doesn't want to trigger a recession by lifting rates too much. The unemployment rate is near 50-year lows of 3.5 per cent and Mr Kuijs says the labour market strength has been driven by demand for workers in the services sector, which employs 80 per cent of workers, and makes up two-thirds of GDP. \"The labour market tightness may also reflect some labour hoarding, as firms worry they may not easily find new employees if they let some go,\" he says. S & P expects the economy to expand by 1.4 per cent this year and unemployment to rise moderately. That's more optimistic than the RBA's forecast of 0.9 per cent. The global ratings agency says if a rise in the unemployment rate can be limited to around 1 percentage point, then the economic and financial fall out should remain \"manageable.\"",
