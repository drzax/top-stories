The miner made a net profit of almost $1.1 billion for the 2023 financial year, up nearly 11 per cent from 2022. New Hope chief executive Rob Bishop says strong demand and global supply constraints pushed thermal coal prices to record levels in the first half of the year. “Exceptional performance across the business throughout FY23 enabled our team to capitalise on the market conditions, finishing the year with $730.7 million cash at bank, no debt following the convertible note repurchase and a net asset position of $2,525.3 million,” Mr Bishop said. Global coal consumption is at a record high thanks to strong growth in Asia outpacing falling demand in the US and Europe according to the International Energy Agency. Demand from the two largest coal users, China and India, offset demand falls in developed countries in 2022. New Hope sold coal for an average of $346.73 during the year, up from $281.84 in 2022. Investors get a final dividend of 21 cents a share, but that's down from the 31 cents a share they got in 2022. They also get a special dividend of 9 cents a share, but that is also down from the 25 cents a share they got last year. Mr Bishop says New Hope's results this year are \"outstanding' so how come the dividends are lower? with Reuters",

                "plaintext": "Senior business correspondent Peter Ryan has been reading the minutes from the Reserve Bank's meeting earlier this month when it kept the official cash rate on hold at 4.1 per cent. The RBA considered raising rates by 0.25 per cent, before deciding to leave the benchmark interest rate unchanged for the third month in a row. The minutes have just been released and here is Peter's report: The Reserve Bank has signalled that inflation remains a clear and present danger to the economy and that another interest rate rise can’t be ruled out. That’s despite evidence that 12 interest rate rises since May last year are continuing to slow the economy with RBA board members warning inflation is still too high. While the RBA board left the cash rate on hold at its meeting a fortnight ago, the minutes released this morning show the battle to get 4.9 percent inflation back into the 2 to 3 percent target zone is far from over. In considering whether to inflict another rate hike, the Board noted that inflation was “still too high” and “was expected to remain so for an extended period”. While headline inflation is slowing, the minutes show concern that services inflation might take a while to decline and that the labour market remains tight with the jobless rate hovering around a 50 year low. “Were inflation to remain above target for an even longer period, this could cause inflation expectations to move higher which would likely require an even larger increase,” the minutes warn. However, members also note that the economy is “experiencing a period of subdued growth” led by household consumption as high inflation and rate rises weigh on household budgets. As the impact of rate rises hit, the Board noted the risk “the economy could slow more sharply than forecast” - in other words a hard economic landing. The minutes show a deepening concern about China where conditions in the property market had deteriorated further. “Members noted .. significant challenges from financial stress among developers and further defaults posed a risk to economic activity.” Board members said they would be guided by incoming economic data in assessing the need for further hikes. Money markets only see an 8 percent probability of a cash rate rise to 4.35 percent at the RBA’s October meeting. However, if inflation makes a comeback or remains sticky, there is an outside chance of another rate rise before the end of the year. Judo Bank economic adviser Warren Hogan sees the outside chance of a November rate rise on Melbourne Cup Day as the final nail in the coffin of inflation. The minutes make no mention of Philip Lowe’s final meeting as Reserve Bank governor. Michele Bullock is in her second day as RBA governor and will chair the next meeting on October 3.",
