The nuclear-armed country has been seeking to place what would be its first military spy satellite into orbit, saying it eventually plans a fleet of satellites to monitor moves by US and South Korean troops. The launch on Thursday has prompted an emergency warning in Japan telling residents of the prefecture of Okinawa to take cover indoors. About 20 minutes following the alert, the Japanese government followed up with a notice that the missile had passed through towards the Pacific Ocean, and it lifted the emergency warning. In a televised press conference, Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirokazu Matsuno said the repeated missile launches were a threat to regional security. \"We will strongly protest against North Korea and condemn it in the strongest possible terms,\" he says.",

Giuliani, a former federal prosecutor and New York City mayor, was ordered to pay a $US150,000 bond and not to intimidate any of his 18 co-defendents or witnesses in the case, according to court papers. Seven of Trump's other co-defendants in the criminal case —which was brought by Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis and accuses him and his associates of trying to reverse his 2020 election loss in Georgia — have already surrendered at an Atlanta jail, according to county records. Speaking in New York before flying to Atlanta, Giuliani denied wrongdoing and defended Trump .",
