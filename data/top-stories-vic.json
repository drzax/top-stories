AusNet spokesperson Nicci de Ryk told ABC Statewide Drive the power in most homes will be restored by 10pm AEDT tonight. “We've been able to gain access to those impacted areas and we now know the issues we're dealing with,” she said. “There's seven poles that have been affected in the region - three poles completely burnt down, four significantly charred, in addition to some wires down.” She said around 26 homes will remain disconnected. “We’ve got crews going in in the morning to do that permanent fix work, replacing those impacted poles. They are anticipating they’ll have that resolved and move from generator to the existing network structure by the end of tomorrow,” she said. “Broadly, that's the plan to come off generators at some stage once those poles have been rectified.”",
