They get drinking water in jerrycans from the UN school. It tastes salty. The desalination stations stopped working when the fuel ran out. \"How the hell did the entire world just watch and let Israel turn off the water?\" says Mr Keshawi, 59, a US-educated researcher at the International Crisis Group, his voice rising with anger. The nights are the hardest, he says. When airstrikes crash nearby and explosions light up the sky, the adults muster what little resolve they have to soothe the children. \"Boom!\" they yell and cheer when the bombs thunder. The babies laugh. But older kids are terrified. \"It's really killing me,\" Mr Keshawi says. \"It really breaks my heart.\" AP",

A prime-time television address to the nation gives the commander in chief a direct line to the homes of ordinary Americans (hoping that they're still watching broadcast or cable television instead of streaming something). He kept his language simple. Attempting to explain why Americans should both care about wars being fought far away and be willing to help fund them. His message was pretty simple – if America doesn't help fight Ukraine and Israel defend themselves now, then it'll create greater problem later. \"History has taught us that when terrorists don't pay a price for their terror, when dictators don't pay a price for their aggression, they cause more chaos and death and more destruction,\" he said. The United States has sent Ukraine $US60 billion in funding and equipment through military, economic, and humanitarian aid. Israel is the biggest recipient of US foreign aid, being given nearly $US160 billion before this latest outbreak of violence. It's expected the latest request will be for tens of billions more. For Americans who've had to battle through a period of high inflation, it's understandable that many would start to question why America has to foot the bill for foreign conflicts. Mr Biden will hope that his 15 minute speech will convince them that it's money well spent.",

The NAB Consumer Sentiment third quarter survey of about 2,000 Australians found that cost of living stress, which is by far the biggest cause of concern, eased after rising for the past seven quarterly surveys. It said although consumers were still feeling stretched, \"many are growing more accustomed to these pressures\". \"Australians feel better placed to respond quickly if price pressures shift,\" NAB said. \"Eight in ten Australians believe their costs rose for groceries, household bills, transport, eating out and travel over the last three months but fewer expect prices will continue to rise as much.\" \"Australians are managing the cost of living and adapting to shifting price pressures by flexing their newly built 'budgeting muscle'.\" Fewer people now expect prices will continue to rise as much over the next three and 12 months than they did mid-year. As petrol prices nudged record highs, nearly 1 in 2 (45 per cent) of Australians said they had cut back on car journeys to save on fuel. Australians are saving about $300 each month by cutting back on eating out at restaurants (55 per cent), micro treats like coffees and lunches out (50 per cent), tickets to the movies (47 per cent) and saving on car trips. \"Australians continue to reprioritise spending according to what they value personally,\" NAB's Personal Banking Group Executive Rachel Slade said. \"Many Aussies adjusted budgets to cheer on the Matildas in the stadium or treat themselves to a trip away for the school holidays – even if it meant they had to scale back their original plans.\"",
