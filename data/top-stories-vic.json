That is the view of UN Special Rapporteur on the Occupied Palestine Territories Francesca Albanese who said the only hope Gaza had was for an immediate ceasefire to be called and for hostages to be returned to their families. Speaking to News Channel's Karina Carvalho, she said she was horrified by what was happening and that both Israelis and Palestinians deserved and had the right to live in peace, freedom and dignity. \"Hostages are civilians, who have been taken, this is a crime,\" she said. \"There are also soldiers among them, the situation is different because in context of hostilities, soldiers become prisoners of war. So civilians have to be freed immediately. They are in danger, because Israel has carpet-bombed Gaza without respite since October 7.\" She warned peace would not be achieved this way because it created more desperation. \"So, there is chaos reigning in Gaza at the moment,\" she said. \"I hope you appreciate, there is no fuel, no electricity, there is no water, there is nothing that enters other than the few convoys which will only need the 0. 2 per cent of needs of the population, which is being bombed. \"It's pretty cruel what's happening and again, I really hope that there is a cease-fire agreed upon as soon as possible, so that the hostages can return home safe and sound to the families who are so much waiting for them.\"",

At the same time, White House national security spokesman John Kirby told CNN this is not the time for a ceasefire in the conflict between Israel and Hamas militants. \"We don't believe that this is the time for a ceasefire,\" he said. \"Israel has a right to defend themselves. They still have work to do to go after Hamas leadership.\" However, in private two sources familiar with the matter said the White House, Pentagon and State Department have stepped up private appeals for caution in conversations with the Israelis. A US priority is to gain time for negotiations to free other hostages, especially after Friday's unexpected release of Americans Judith and Natalie Raanan, said the sources, who spoke before the recent hostage release. Asked about the possibility of a ceasefire, US President Joe Biden said: \"We should have those hostages released and then we can talk.\"",

It said no fuel would mean a water desalination plant could not function along with bakeries and hospitals. Twenty trucks entered Gaza via Rafah on Monday, taking the total to 54 trucks since Saturday, UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric confirmed. Ms Dujarric said the United Nations was pushing for fuel deliveries so the UN agency providing aid to Palestinians in Gaza, UNRWA, could continue operating. \"They can see the bottom of the fuel tank,\" Dujarric said of UNRWA. \"We're talking days. And when that happens, that will be truly devastating, on top of what is already a devastating humanitarian situation.\" UN officials say about 100 aid trucks would be needed daily to meet essential needs in Gaza, which is home to 2.3 million people. Some 1.4 million of those are now homeless. A US special envoy is negotiating with Israel, Egypt and the United Nations to create a \"sustained delivery mechanism\" to get aid into Gaza after aid convoys began crossing into the strip from Egypt. \"We want to see sustained traffic going through Rafah delivering humanitarian assistance,\" said US State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller, adding that the \"exact mechanism\" of how to do that was under discussion. Mr Miller said the possible diversion of fuel by Hamas was an \"issue that we are discussing now with Israeli authorities.\" \"The United States remains committed to ensuring that civilians in Gaza will continue to have access to food, water, medical care, and other assistance, without diversion by Hamas,\" US President Joe Biden posted on X, formerly known as Twitter. Humanitarian deliveries through Rafah crossing from Egypt began on Saturday after wrangling over procedures for inspecting the aid and bombardments on the Gaza side of the border had left relief materials stranded in Egypt. Rafah is the main crossing in and out of Gaza that does not border Israel. Since Israel has imposed a \"total siege\" of the enclave in retaliation for an attack by Hamas militants on October 7, Rafah has become the focus of efforts to deliver aid. Reuters",
