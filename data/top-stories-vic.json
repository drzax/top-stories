                  "articleBody": "Tennis legend Serena Williams has shared new photos of herself and husband Alexis Ohanian, after announcing her second pregnancy at the Met Gala in New York yesterday. The announcement from 41-year-old Williams came after she stepped away from tennis last year, which she said she had to in order to have a second child. \"Believe me, I never wanted to have to choose between tennis and a family. I don't think it's fair. If I were a guy I wouldn't be writing this because I'd be out there playing and winning while my wife was doing the physical labor of expanding our family,\" she told Vogue in August. Williams and Ohanian's daughter, Olympia, is now five."

The surgeon-general, Vivek Murthy, has released an advisory calling for social isolation to be treated as seriously as obesity or drug abuse. It warns that almost half of all Americans have experienced loneliness, increasing their risk of premature mortality by almost 30 per cent. \"We now know that loneliness is a common feeling that many people experience. It's like hunger or thirst. It's a feeling the body sends us when something we need for survival is missing,\" Murthy told The Associated Press. \"Millions of people in America are struggling in the shadows, and that's not right. That's why I issued this advisory to pull back the curtain on a struggle that too many people are experiencing.\""

Speaking on ABC News Breakfast this morning, Chalmers acknowledged the market was surprised by the RBA's decision, after most major banks predicted rates would remain on hold. \"The impact of these rate rises that are already in the system will be felt over a period of time and each time the independent Reserve Bank gathers, they weigh up all of the considerations, all the pressures in the economy, including this global uncertainty that we are going through right now and they will take that decision independently,\" he said. Chalmers said Australians' budgets were \"already under the pump\", and that next week's federal budget would include some cost of living relief. \"The budget will have a substantial package of relief when it comes to medicines, it will have a package on child care, there will be a bit of help for people with their energy bills,\" he said."

A defence official has told The Associated Press there was no indication the latest balloon was connected to China or any other adversary, and it presented no threats to aviation or national security. The official said the balloon was floating at about 11,000 metres, and did not fly over any critical defence infrastructure or sensitive sites. After determining that the balloon presented no threat to people on the ground or to aviation over Hawaii, the military took no action to bring it down, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss military operations."

                  "headline": "Nick Cave explains why he's going to King Charles III's coronation",
                  "articleBody": "\"Why the f*** are you going to the King's coronation?\" \"Are you a Monarchist? Why go?\" \"The coronation. Seriously????\" These are just some of the messages Australian music icon Nick Cave has received since being announced as a guest for King Charles III's coronation this Saturday. So, the transgressive singer-songwriter has responded in a blog post as part of his The Red Hand Files series. Here's what he wrote ( with my favourite bits highlighted in bold ): Dear Jon, Adrian, Roger and Matt, I'll make this a quick one because I've got to work out what I am going to wear to the Coronation. I am not a monarchist, nor am I a royalist, nor am I an ardent republican for that matter; what I am also not is so spectacularly incurious about the world and the way it works, so ideologically captured, so damn grouchy, as to refuse an invitation to what will more than likely be the most important historical event in the UK of our age. Not just the most important, but the strangest, the weirdest. I once met the late Queen at an event at Buckingham Palace for 'Aspirational Australians living in the UK' (or something like that). It was a mostly awkward affair, but the Queen herself, dressed in a salmon coloured twin-set, seemed almost extraterrestrial and was the most charismatic woman I have ever met. Maybe it was the lighting, but she actually glowed. As I told my mother – who was the same age as the Queen and, like the Queen, died in her nineties – about that day, her old eyes filled with tears. When I watched the Queen's funeral on the television last year I found, to my bafflement, that I was weeping myself as the coffin was stripped of the crown, orb and sceptre and lowered through the floor of St. George's Chapel. I guess what I am trying to say is that, beyond the interminable but necessary debates about the abolition of the monarchy, I hold an inexplicable emotional attachment to the Royals – the strangeness of them, the deeply eccentric nature of the whole affair that so perfectly reflects the unique weirdness of Britain itself. I'm just drawn to that kind of thing – the bizarre, the uncanny, the stupefyingly spectacular, the awe-inspiring. And as for what the young Nick Cave would have thought – well, the young Nick Cave was, in all due respect to the young Nick Cave, young, and like many young people, mostly demented, so I'm a little cautious around using him as a benchmark for what I should or should not do. He was cute though, I'll give him that. Deranged, but cute. So, with all that in mind, I am looking forward to going the Coronation. I think I'll wear a suit. Love, Nick"

The 76ers centre lost the MVP award to Jokić in the past two seasons. If Jokić wins again, however, he would be the first player to win three consecutive MVP awards since Boston's Larry Bird (from 1984 to 1986). The award is decided by a panel of sportswriters and broadcasters, as well as fans. We'll bring you the announcement of the winner when it happens this morning."

After voting, Bahr quickly turns his camera off, leaving a black screen showing just his name. You can then see some people in the office trying not to laugh at his brief appearance. A GOP Senate spokeswoman said Bahr, a truck driver, worked until 4:45am on the day of the meeting, so we'll give him the benefit of the doubt. (Watch from 6:35)"

The surgeon-general, Vivek Murthy, has released an advisory calling for social isolation to be treated as seriously as obesity or drug abuse. It warns that almost half of all Americans have experienced loneliness, increasing their risk of premature mortality by almost 30 per cent. \"We now know that loneliness is a common feeling that many people experience. It's like hunger or thirst. It's a feeling the body sends us when something we need for survival is missing,\" Murthy told The Associated Press. \"Millions of people in America are struggling in the shadows, and that's not right. That's why I issued this advisory to pull back the curtain on a struggle that too many people are experiencing.\"",

Speaking on ABC News Breakfast this morning, Chalmers acknowledged the market was surprised by the RBA's decision, after most major banks predicted rates would remain on hold. \"The impact of these rate rises that are already in the system will be felt over a period of time and each time the independent Reserve Bank gathers, they weigh up all of the considerations, all the pressures in the economy, including this global uncertainty that we are going through right now and they will take that decision independently,\" he said. Chalmers said Australians' budgets were \"already under the pump\", and that next week's federal budget would include some cost of living relief. \"The budget will have a substantial package of relief when it comes to medicines, it will have a package on child care, there will be a bit of help for people with their energy bills,\" he said.",

The balloon was first detected on Friday, and was the latest balloon sighting after the US military shot down what officials said was a Chinese spy balloon about three months ago. A defence official has told The Associated Press there was no indication the latest balloon was connected to China or any other adversary, and it presented no threats to aviation or national security. The official said the balloon was floating at about 11,000 metres, and did not fly over any critical defence infrastructure or sensitive sites. After determining that the balloon presented no threat to people on the ground or to aviation over Hawaii, the military took no action to bring it down, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss military operations.",

Seriously????\" These are just some of the messages Australian music icon Nick Cave has received since being announced as a guest for King Charles III's coronation this Saturday. So, the transgressive singer-songwriter has responded in a blog post as part of his The Red Hand Files series. Here's what he wrote ( with my favourite bits highlighted in bold ): Dear Jon, Adrian, Roger and Matt, I'll make this a quick one because I've got to work out what I am going to wear to the Coronation. I am not a monarchist, nor am I a royalist, nor am I an ardent republican for that matter; what I am also not is so spectacularly incurious about the world and the way it works, so ideologically captured, so damn grouchy, as to refuse an invitation to what will more than likely be the most important historical event in the UK of our age. Not just the most important, but the strangest, the weirdest. I once met the late Queen at an event at Buckingham Palace for 'Aspirational Australians living in the UK' (or something like that). It was a mostly awkward affair, but the Queen herself, dressed in a salmon coloured twin-set, seemed almost extraterrestrial and was the most charismatic woman I have ever met. Maybe it was the lighting, but she actually glowed. As I told my mother – who was the same age as the Queen and, like the Queen, died in her nineties – about that day, her old eyes filled with tears. When I watched the Queen's funeral on the television last year I found, to my bafflement, that I was weeping myself as the coffin was stripped of the crown, orb and sceptre and lowered through the floor of St. George's Chapel. I guess what I am trying to say is that, beyond the interminable but necessary debates about the abolition of the monarchy, I hold an inexplicable emotional attachment to the Royals – the strangeness of them, the deeply eccentric nature of the whole affair that so perfectly reflects the unique weirdness of Britain itself. I'm just drawn to that kind of thing – the bizarre, the uncanny, the stupefyingly spectacular, the awe-inspiring. And as for what the young Nick Cave would have thought – well, the young Nick Cave was, in all due respect to the young Nick Cave, young, and like many young people, mostly demented, so I'm a little cautious around using him as a benchmark for what I should or should not do. He was cute though, I'll give him that. Deranged, but cute. So, with all that in mind, I am looking forward to going the Coronation. I think I'll wear a suit. Love, Nick",

The 76ers centre lost the MVP award to Jokić in the past two seasons. If Jokić wins again, however, he would be the first player to win three consecutive MVP awards since Boston's Larry Bird (from 1984 to 1986).

A senator in the US state of Minnesota has become a reluctant social media star after voting shirtless while lying in bed during a meeting. In a video streamed on YouTube ( which you can watch below from the 6:35 mark ), Republican Senator Calvin Bahr can briefly be seen voting during a Zoom call. After voting, Bahr quickly turns his camera off, leaving a black screen showing just his name. You can then see some people in the office trying not to laugh at his brief appearance. A GOP Senate spokeswoman said Bahr, a truck driver, worked until 4:45am on the day of the meeting, so we'll give him the benefit of the doubt. (Watch from 6:35)",

Speaking on ABC News Breakfast this morning, Chalmers acknowledged the market was surprised by the RBA's decision, after most major banks predicted rates would remain on hold. \"The impact of these rate rises that are already in the system will be felt over a period of time and each time the independent Reserve Bank gathers, they weigh up all of the considerations, all the pressures in the economy, including this global uncertainty that we are going through right now and they will take that decision independently,\" he said. Chalmers said Australians' budgets were \"already under the pump\", and that next week's federal budget would include some cost of living relief. \"The budget will have a substantial package of relief when it comes to medicines, it will have a package on child care, there will be a bit of help for people with their energy bills,\" he said.",

A defence official has told The Associated Press there was no indication the latest balloon was connected to China or any other adversary, and it presented no threats to aviation or national security. The official said the balloon was floating at about 11,000 metres, and did not fly over any critical defence infrastructure or sensitive sites. After determining that the balloon presented no threat to people on the ground or to aviation over Hawaii, the military took no action to bring it down, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss military operations.",

                  "headline": "European shares close at one-month low",
                  "articleBody": "European markets also had a rough session overnight. The pan-European STOXX 600 index fell 1.2%, finishing at its worst level since early April. Oil and gas shares were some of the biggest drags on the market. They plunged 4.5%, roughly in line with plunging oil prices lower — on worries about a US bond default, weak economic data from China and expectations the US and Europe will raise interest rates again this week. Shares of BP dropped 8.6%, after the company pared a share buyback plan but made a $US5 billion profit in the first quarter of 2023. Investors were also refraining from risk-taking ahead of the US Federal Reserve's policy decision, that is likely to push the US central bank's benchmark overnight interest rate to its highest level in nearly 16 years. \"Nerves are rising about the debt ceiling standoff in the US, with the prospect that a default could shake the global economy, just as worries about further banking repercussions have been calmed for now,\" said Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown. ECB expected to slow down its rate hikes Markets also keenly awaited a rate decision by the European Central Bank (ECB) on Thursday evening (AEST), where it is widely seen hiking by 0.25 percentage points. Derivatives markets also see European rates peaking at around 3.7% in November. Boosting the case for a smaller interest-rate increase, data showed euro zone banks are turning off the credit taps and a key gauge of inflation is finally falling. \"The data are finally in and they suggest the ECB can slow down the pace of tightening from 50 to 25 bp [basis points]. That said, this does not need to be a dovish 25bp hike,\" said Davide Oneglia, senior economist at TS Lombard. \"The bigger question remains where the ECB will stop. The answer depends mostly on a mid-year US recession materialising and on the Fed response to it.\""

                  "articleBody": "Gold extended its gains overnight on renewed fears of contagion in the US banking sector, ahead of the Federal Reserve's widely anticipated decision to hike interest rates. Spot gold jumped 1.5% to $US2,012 an ounce (its biggest daily rise in a month). The precious metal traded as high as $US2,019.37 overnight, its highest value since mid-April. \"The banking concerns are back... it's really removing that risk that the Fed was going to possibly be considering a June rate rise,\" said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at OANDA. Shares of US regional lenders plunged, while Treasury yields fell as the collapse of First Republic Bank triggered investor concerns about the health of other mid-sized lenders. While gold is considered a hedge against economic uncertainties, rising rates hurt demand for this zero-yielding asset. Gold has also been supported by some safe-haven demand from resurgent worries over the banking sector's health and US debt ceiling uncertainty, Bank of China International analyst Xiao Fu said. Spot silver rose 1.1% to $US25.25 per ounce. Platinum gained 1.2% to $US1,061.99. Palladium fell 1.5% to $US1,429.47."

                  "headline": "RBA delivers 'massive' hit to millions of Australians struggling with overwhelming cost pressures",
                  "articleBody": "The Reserve Bank's latest interest rate hike has increased the chance of Australia's economy suffering a \"hard landing\". Deloitte Access Economics has rebuked the RBA for playing \"recession roulette\", after the bank lifted rates to their highest level since April 2012. The NAB and AMP have both increased their probabilities of Australia slipping into a recession from 40 per cent to 45 per cent. AMP says a \"consumer recession\" (which, to many Australians, will feel like a recession, even if one is not technically reached) is now \" inevitable \"). Both chief economists Alan Oster and Shane Oliver said a technical recession — two consecutive quarters of negative economic growth — could be achieved with another interest rate increase.

                  "articleBody": "The Reserve Bank shocked most experts yesterday, when it decided to lift interest rates by another 0.25 percentage points. This brings its cash rate target to a 3.85% (a fresh 11-year high). However, the coup de grace was last week's inflation number for the March quarter. The RBA was spooked by an acceleration in price rises for services such as hospitality, healthcare and education. \"Looking overseas, we see worryingly persistent services price inflation,\" RBA governor Philip Lowe said. \"It is possible that circumstances might be different here in Australia, but the experience abroad points to an upside risk, especially given the high degree of commonality across countries in inflation dynamics recently.\" Life could become 'more difficult' It's a risk the RBA evidently did not want to take, deciding that another rate rise now might head off the need for even higher rates later. \"We are taking a bit more time than some other countries, on the basis that doing so can preserve some of the gains in the labour market,\" Mr Lowe explained. \"But there is a limit here. If we take too long to get inflation back to target, expectations will adjust and life will become more difficult.\" For more on this, here's the story by my colleague Michael Janda :"

                  "headline": "Oil prices sink 5% amid concerns about recession and US debt default",
                  "articleBody": "The price of crude oil plunged by around 5% to a five-week low as concerns about the US economy mount. Brent futures fell by $US3.99 (or 5%), to settle at $US75.32 a barrel. West Texas Intermediate crude (WTI) fell $US4 (or 5.3%), to end at $US71.66. That was the lowest close for both benchmarks since March 24 and was also their biggest one-day percentage declines since early January. Oil prices fell after US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said the government may be unable to meet all of its payment obligations by June 1 — without legislation to raise Washington's borrowing limit. The White House said President Joe Biden would not negotiate over the debt ceiling during his meeting with four top congressional leaders on May 9, but he will discuss starting \"a separate budget process.\" Recession risk The latest data showed that US job openings fell for a third straight month in March and layoffs increased to the highest level in more than two years. It suggests the job market is weakening, which could aid the Federal Reserve's fight against inflation. \"The US economy continues to evolve in a manner consistent with a recession commencing later this year,\" analysts at Barclays wrote in a note to clients. \"The manufacturing sector is contracting, the consumer is struggling ... [and] there are broadening signs of cracks emerging within the labor market.\" This week, investors will look for market direction from expected interest rate hikes by central banks still fighting inflation. More hikes could slow economic growth and reduce demand for energy (and oil). The US Federal Reserve is expected to increase interest rates by another 0.25 percentage points on Thursday morning (AEST). The European Central Bank is also expected to raise rates at its policy meeting on Thursday evening (AEST). \"Oil basically has weakening prospects from the world’s two largest economies, China and the US, and if the macro backdrop deteriorates momentum selling could easily send prices below the $US70 level,\" said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at OANDA. Over the weekend, data from China, the world's top crude importer, showed manufacturing activity fell unexpectedly in April. That was the first contraction in China's manufacturing purchasing managers' index since December."

                  "articleBody": "US markets closed sharply lower after regional bank stocks plunged on renewed fears about their ability to survive. The benchmark S & P 500 fell 1.2%, while the Nasdaq Composite and Dow Jones index dropped 1.1% each. Shares of small to mid-sized banks have extended yesterday's falls after the seizure and auction of First Republic Bank. Most of First Republic's assets were bought by JPMorgan Chase in a deal brokered by a regulator (the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp). Two other US regional banks (Signature Bank and Silicon Valley Bank) collapsed in March. \"There are concerns that this is not over, and that rates are going to (continue to) go up, and it could be a catalyst for more problems,\" said Quincy Krosby, chief global strategist at LPL Financial. \"There's more and more talk about problems with commercial real estate. Commercial real estate really is, for the most part, the province of the regional banks.\" Overnight, regional banks PacWest and Western Alliance plummeted 27% and 15%, respectively, while the KBW regional banking index fell to its lowest level intraday since late 2020. Jitters ahead of Fed decision Investors also adopted a \"risk off\" mentality as they tried to gauge how much longer the US Federal Reserve may need to hike interest rates. The US dollar index (which measures the greenback against a basket of major currencies) fell 0.2% to 101.93. The Fed is expected to lift rates by 0.25 percentage points on Thursday morning (AEST). Markets are anxious for any signals from the central bank on whether it will be the last hike for now, or if further increases are possible if inflation remains high. Meanwhile, energy shares dropped after oil prices plunged 5% as investors worried about a potential US debt default. The S & P 500 energy sector was down the most of any major sector, followed by S & P financials."

Oil and gas shares were some of the biggest drags on the market. They plunged 4.5%, roughly in line with plunging oil prices lower — on worries about a US bond default, weak economic data from China and expectations the US and Europe will raise interest rates again this week. Shares of BP dropped 8.6%, after the company pared a share buyback plan but made a $US5 billion profit in the first quarter of 2023. Investors were also refraining from risk-taking ahead of the US Federal Reserve's policy decision, that is likely to push the US central bank's benchmark overnight interest rate to its highest level in nearly 16 years. \"Nerves are rising about the debt ceiling standoff in the US, with the prospect that a default could shake the global economy, just as worries about further banking repercussions have been calmed for now,\" said Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown. ECB expected to slow down its rate hikes Markets also keenly awaited a rate decision by the European Central Bank (ECB) on Thursday evening (AEST), where it is widely seen hiking by 0.25 percentage points. Derivatives markets also see European rates peaking at around 3.7% in November. Boosting the case for a smaller interest-rate increase, data showed euro zone banks are turning off the credit taps and a key gauge of inflation is finally falling. \"The data are finally in and they suggest the ECB can slow down the pace of tightening from 50 to 25 bp [basis points]. That said, this does not need to be a dovish 25bp hike,\" said Davide Oneglia, senior economist at TS Lombard. \"The bigger question remains where the ECB will stop. The answer depends mostly on a mid-year US recession materialising and on the Fed response to it.\"",

Spot gold jumped 1.5% to $US2,012 an ounce (its biggest daily rise in a month). The precious metal traded as high as $US2,019.37 overnight, its highest value since mid-April. \"The banking concerns are back... it's really removing that risk that the Fed was going to possibly be considering a June rate rise,\" said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at OANDA. Shares of US regional lenders plunged, while Treasury yields fell as the collapse of First Republic Bank triggered investor concerns about the health of other mid-sized lenders. While gold is considered a hedge against economic uncertainties, rising rates hurt demand for this zero-yielding asset. Gold has also been supported by some safe-haven demand from resurgent worries over the banking sector's health and US debt ceiling uncertainty, Bank of China International analyst Xiao Fu said. Spot silver rose 1.1% to $US25.25 per ounce. Platinum gained 1.2% to $US1,061.99. Palladium fell 1.5% to $US1,429.47.",

This brings its cash rate target to a 3.85% (a fresh 11-year high). However, the coup de grace was last week's inflation number for the March quarter. The RBA was spooked by an acceleration in price rises for services such as hospitality, healthcare and education. \"Looking overseas, we see worryingly persistent services price inflation,\" RBA governor Philip Lowe said. \"It is possible that circumstances might be different here in Australia, but the experience abroad points to an upside risk, especially given the high degree of commonality across countries in inflation dynamics recently.\" Life could become 'more difficult' It's a risk the RBA evidently did not want to take, deciding that another rate rise now might head off the need for even higher rates later. \"We are taking a bit more time than some other countries, on the basis that doing so can preserve some of the gains in the labour market,\" Mr Lowe explained. \"But there is a limit here. If we take too long to get inflation back to target, expectations will adjust and life will become more difficult.\" For more on this, here's the story by my colleague Michael Janda :",

                  "plaintext": "The price of crude oil plunged by around 5% to a five-week low as concerns about the US economy mount. Brent futures fell by $US3.99 (or 5%), to settle at $US75.32 a barrel. West Texas Intermediate crude (WTI) fell $US4 (or 5.3%), to end at $US71.66. That was the lowest close for both benchmarks since March 24 and was also their biggest one-day percentage declines since early January. Oil prices fell after US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said the government may be unable to meet all of its payment obligations by June 1 — without legislation to raise Washington's borrowing limit. The White House said President Joe Biden would not negotiate over the debt ceiling during his meeting with four top congressional leaders on May 9, but he will discuss starting \"a separate budget process.\" Recession risk The latest data showed that US job openings fell for a third straight month in March and layoffs increased to the highest level in more than two years. It suggests the job market is weakening, which could aid the Federal Reserve's fight against inflation. \"The US economy continues to evolve in a manner consistent with a recession commencing later this year,\" analysts at Barclays wrote in a note to clients. \"The manufacturing sector is contracting, the consumer is struggling ... [and] there are broadening signs of cracks emerging within the labor market.\" This week, investors will look for market direction from expected interest rate hikes by central banks still fighting inflation. More hikes could slow economic growth and reduce demand for energy (and oil). The US Federal Reserve is expected to increase interest rates by another 0.25 percentage points on Thursday morning (AEST). The European Central Bank is also expected to raise rates at its policy meeting on Thursday evening (AEST). \"Oil basically has weakening prospects from the world’s two largest economies, China and the US, and if the macro backdrop deteriorates momentum selling could easily send prices below the $US70 level,\" said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at OANDA. Over the weekend, data from China, the world's top crude importer, showed manufacturing activity fell unexpectedly in April. That was the first contraction in China's manufacturing purchasing managers' index since December.",

The benchmark S & P 500 fell 1.2%, while the Nasdaq Composite and Dow Jones index dropped 1.1% each. Shares of small to mid-sized banks have extended yesterday's falls after the seizure and auction of First Republic Bank. Most of First Republic's assets were bought by JPMorgan Chase in a deal brokered by a regulator (the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp). Two other US regional banks (Signature Bank and Silicon Valley Bank) collapsed in March. \"There are concerns that this is not over, and that rates are going to (continue to) go up, and it could be a catalyst for more problems,\" said Quincy Krosby, chief global strategist at LPL Financial. \"There's more and more talk about problems with commercial real estate. Commercial real estate really is, for the most part, the province of the regional banks.\" Overnight, regional banks PacWest and Western Alliance plummeted 27% and 15%, respectively, while the KBW regional banking index fell to its lowest level intraday since late 2020. Jitters ahead of Fed decision Investors also adopted a \"risk off\" mentality as they tried to gauge how much longer the US Federal Reserve may need to hike interest rates. The US dollar index (which measures the greenback against a basket of major currencies) fell 0.2% to 101.93. The Fed is expected to lift rates by 0.25 percentage points on Thursday morning (AEST). Markets are anxious for any signals from the central bank on whether it will be the last hike for now, or if further increases are possible if inflation remains high. Meanwhile, energy shares dropped after oil prices plunged 5% as investors worried about a potential US debt default. The S & P 500 energy sector was down the most of any major sector, followed by S & P financials.",

This brings its cash rate target to a 3.85% (a fresh 11-year high). However, the coup de grace was last week's inflation number for the March quarter. The RBA was spooked by an acceleration in price rises for services such as hospitality, healthcare and education. \"Looking overseas, we see worryingly persistent services price inflation,\" RBA governor Philip Lowe said. \"It is possible that circumstances might be different here in Australia, but the experience abroad points to an upside risk, especially given the high degree of commonality across countries in inflation dynamics recently.\" Life could become 'more difficult' It's a risk the RBA evidently did not want to take, deciding that another rate rise now might head off the need for even higher rates later. \"We are taking a bit more time than some other countries, on the basis that doing so can preserve some of the gains in the labour market,\" Mr Lowe explained. \"But there is a limit here. If we take too long to get inflation back to target, expectations will adjust and life will become more difficult.\" For more on this, here's the story by my colleague Michael Janda :",

              "plaintext": "The price of crude oil plunged by around 5% to a five-week low as concerns about the US economy mount. Brent futures fell by $US3.99 (or 5%), to settle at $US75.32 a barrel. West Texas Intermediate crude (WTI) fell $US4 (or 5.3%), to end at $US71.66. That was the lowest close for both benchmarks since March 24 and was also their biggest one-day percentage declines since early January. Oil prices fell after US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said the government may be unable to meet all of its payment obligations by June 1 — without legislation to raise Washington's borrowing limit. The White House said President Joe Biden would not negotiate over the debt ceiling during his meeting with four top congressional leaders on May 9, but he will discuss starting \"a separate budget process.\" Recession risk The latest data showed that US job openings fell for a third straight month in March and layoffs increased to the highest level in more than two years. It suggests the job market is weakening, which could aid the Federal Reserve's fight against inflation. \"The US economy continues to evolve in a manner consistent with a recession commencing later this year,\" analysts at Barclays wrote in a note to clients. \"The manufacturing sector is contracting, the consumer is struggling ... [and] there are broadening signs of cracks emerging within the labor market.\" This week, investors will look for market direction from expected interest rate hikes by central banks still fighting inflation. More hikes could slow economic growth and reduce demand for energy (and oil). The US Federal Reserve is expected to increase interest rates by another 0.25 percentage points on Thursday morning (AEST). The European Central Bank is also expected to raise rates at its policy meeting on Thursday evening (AEST). \"Oil basically has weakening prospects from the world’s two largest economies, China and the US, and if the macro backdrop deteriorates momentum selling could easily send prices below the $US70 level,\" said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at OANDA. Over the weekend, data from China, the world's top crude importer, showed manufacturing activity fell unexpectedly in April. That was the first contraction in China's manufacturing purchasing managers' index since December.",
