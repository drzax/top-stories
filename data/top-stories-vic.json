I was \nreally proud, frankly, to include in the budget last night the biggest increase in rent assistance for three decades. And I know that that won't make the pressures in the rental market disappear but it will help people get through while we try to build more supply, which is our overwhelming objective when it comes to the housing market."

Jim Chalmers says he doesn't want to \"carve up Australians in different groups and try to pit them against each other\". Chalmers: We are genuinely trying to govern for the whole place. Sometimes that means giving extra help to people who are doing it toughest, but typically, we are trying to be a good, decent, middle of the road government which recognises the legitimate aspirations that people have in middle Australia."

                  "headline": "Budget boost for rent assistance well below what advocates hoped for",
                  "articleBody": "By national consumer affairs correspondent Norman Hermant The federal budget revealed 1.1 million households will receive an increase in Commonwealth rent assistance. It will be boosted by 15 per cent, taking the maximum payment to $180 a fortnight for a single person. Most of the recipients are pensioners or those receiving Centrelink benefits. \"It’s good, it’s important that it’s been raised,” says Homelessness Australia CEO Kate Colvin. “When people are struggling to put three meals a day on the table, every dollar makes a difference.” The increase has been budgeted at $2.7 billion over four years. But Colvin says an extra $15.50 a week won’t make much difference to how people feel about their ability to pay the rent. “It’s just that rents have increased so much,” she says. A recent report from Anglicare found less than one per cent of private rental properties were deemed affordable. Before the budget, the Australian Council of Social Service had recommended doubling the Commonwealth rent assistance payment. Last week, the ABC spoke with 20-year-old Abby Manning, who until recently had relied on the Youth Allowance payment and Commonwealth rent assistance while studying at TAFE. After seeing the budget last night, she says the rent assistance increase wouldn’t make much difference. “I was hoping the government would take this as a chance to do something bigger and better,” she says. “Obviously I’m disappointed. I mean, it’s like two dollars a day.”"

                  "articleBody": "That question was just put to Jim Chalmers, amid ongoing debate about the impact of the budget on inflation. The Treasurer says he doesn't pre-empt decisions made by the Reserve Bank board. Chalmers: Never have. Never will. Don't intend to do that today. The defining influence on our decisions around the cost of living package, our decisions around the growth package, and the historic \nrestraint that we have shown in spending has been this inflation challenge. We are supremely confident that the budget that we handed down last night will take some of these cost-of-living pressures off without adding to inflation. The Treasurer says \"such a big proportion of that spending in 23-24 is legacy issues that we had to clean up\". Chalmers: The fact that the cost of living package \nonly adds 0.1% of GDP in that period, the fact that our energy plan, the combination of the price caps and the bill relief takes three-quarters of a click off inflation next year. All of these things, I think, are important demonstrations for why so many of the bank economists in particular have come out today and said at \nworst the impact on the economy is neutral and many of them have said better than that. There won't be unanimity about that, you can always find if you look hard enough, you can always find a view on either side of the spectrum."

First up, Jim Chalmers is asked why those who receive the single parenting payment won't benefit from the $40 increase to Jobseeker and other working-age payments. Chalmers: The $40 base rate increase to JobSeeker and some of the other working-age payments was all about addressing the lowest payments in the system. When it comes to [single] parenting payment, what we have done is quite dramatically expand the eligibility for that. What it means if you're on parenting payment single, the difference between that and JobSeeker is about $177 a fortnight. And so parenting payment single is already a higher rate, about 95% of the age pension as I \nunderstand it. We're expanding eligibility for it and introducing more generous income arrangements for it as well."

They’ve told national technology reporter Danny Tran that the budget is a welcome step after months of data breaches, cyber-attacks and sirens sounding over the power of artificial intelligence. Here's the latest from Danny: Misha Schubert from Science and Technology Australia says the budget will allow Australia to keep pace with the rapid scale of advancement we’re seeing on the horizon. Misha: Unless we make those deep investments, we know that Australia will fall behind, will lose competitive advantage and that will come at a cost of Australian jobs and living standards, so the race is on to keep Australia at the forefront of an array of new frontier technologies. Cybersecurity has come away as a winner with the federal government announcing $101.6 million over the next five years to boost our cyber capabilities. That bucket of cash includes $46.5 million over four years to set up a Coordinator for Cyber Security, who will be tasked with making sure Australia can manage any cyber threats coming our way. On the domestic side of things, small businesses will also get a helping hand to defend themselves against cybercriminals with a new ‘cyber wardens’ program, which will cost about $23.4 million over three years. Cash will also be pumped into stronger privacy protections for Australians."

The budget has some support to help deal with this growing problem. Here’s more from national consumer affairs reporter, Michael Atkin: Michael: The federal government was alarmed by the record scam losses revealed last month and this budget has committed far more money to protecting Australians – in total just over $86 million over four years. The stories of those who lose everything to scammers are devastating and the financial blow can impact a family for generations or cripple a business. Victims I’ve interviewed express frustration that more isn’t being done to address gaps that are exploited by scammers on social media platforms, telco networks and in the banking system. Consumer groups have been pushing hard for banks to be made liable to repay scam funds, which they say would drive innovation. It’s something the sector has outright rejected, arguing it would reduce personal responsibility. The biggest ticket item in the budget is establishing a National Anti-Scam Centre to be run by the consumer watchdog, the ACCC — a move first announced in November. We’re still waiting on the detail but the government says it will involve government, the big banks, telcos and others to prevent and disrupt scam activity. It also says industry will be held to account with tough new codes."

Grandparents who are full-time carers of grandchildren who are children of a veteran will also be made eligible for supports under the Defence, Veterans and Families Acute Support Package Act, which can include childcare, counselling, household assistance, school transport and other services. The single parenting payment is available to eligible carers and that scheme will be extended to include people with children up to 14 years of age, meaning they will receive a higher payment than they would if they were on JobSeeker. The $40 base rate increase being applied to a number of payments is not being applied to Carer Allowance."

NT Treasurer Eva Lawler’s inaugural budget features a massive infrastructure spend planned for the impending financial year, with $2.1 billion pegged mainly for the jurisdiction’s roads and housing. While the construction and mining sectors have applauded this year’s allocations, there’s not been any huge departmental increases put on the table for health, education or the NT Police force. The NT opposition, police union and territory’s social services council have all criticised the 2023 NT budget's priorities, saying more focus should've been placed on the region's most vulnerable. Opposition Leader Lia Finocchiaro said police were all but ignored in the middle of a \"crime crisis\"."

Those additional payments are described as being for the ABC to continue to support local news and current affairs services, and for the SBS to continue to make news content available for Chinese and Arabic speaking communities in Australia."

I've passed it to political reporter Jake Evans who says: There's a big \"TBC\" over the whole higher education sector, because the government is currently in negotiations with unions, universities and others to develop a \"University Accord\". That deal would be very wide-ranging, looking not only at tertiary education funding and structure, but also at student loans and loan repayment. For now, there's no new incentive schemes or loan relief, besides a technical decision by the government to forgo $21 million worth of debt it would be owed over the next decade from loans issued in 2017 and 2018 under the VET FEE-HELP program, due to delays in the transfer of those loans to the Australian Taxation Office. It means students currently paying off loans face a 7 per cent increase on June 1 when they are indexed, which will add thousands more to many student debts."

However the federal government has committed $50 million for further research on long COVID to be paid through the Medical Research Future Fund. A parliamentary committee inquiry into long COVID and repeat infections was released just at the end of last month, which included recommendations for long COVID clinics to be established in some public hospitals, more support and education. The government is developing its national plan on long COVID which it says will consider the findings of that committee's inquiry, so we may see more on this in the future."

                  "headline": "Conservation groups say the budget doesn't do enough for the environment",
                  "articleBody": "By the Specialist Reporting Team's Loretta Florance: The government came into office with a mandate to improve Australia's environmental record, but conservation groups say while the budget has some promising measures on climate change, it doesn't provide nearly enough money to back the government's ambitious agenda to do more to protect the country's natural environment. The Australian Conservation Foundation's Kelly O'Shanassy welcomes investment in \"climate action, renewable energy and clean exports\", including $2 billion to speed up development of Australia's hydrogen industry and $1.3 billion towards energy efficiency in houses. \"That's really important because Australians are struggling with the cost of living and investing in energy efficiency in homes,\" she says. There was also $121 million over four years to make good on the government's promise to set up a new national body, Environment Protection Australia (EPA), as well as another $51.5 million over four years for a new environment information agency. Ms O'Shanassy says that's \"a good investment in forming a new agency\". But the public is yet to see legislation to establish a national EPA, and the Wilderness Society's Tim Beshara says the government needs to get on with it. \"The new EPA and a data collection agency is a good start for figuring out how we do address the problems that we're facing on the nature side,\" he says. \"[But] I think that's a patch-up for where we should have been. I think that should have been in last year's budget and we should have been well advanced from where we're at right now to the reform agenda.\" Both groups also say the government hasn't put any significant new money behind its ambitious goal of zero extinctions. \"There's nothing in this budget that is going to lead to additional species coming off the [endangered] list in the right way — that is not becoming extinct, but actually becoming more and more common, less and less rare,\" Beshara says. \"The Australian government has obligations for hundreds of species to have put in place a recovery plan and to fund that, and the backlog on writing those plans and implementing those plans and funding those plans is rising. \"So, until there is dedicated additional substantive funding put into endangered species recovery, things are going to continue to decline. It's hard not to see we're going to have more extinctions [under] the Albanese government.\""

However, the amount you receive will differ from state to state, as the money is jointly funded and the federal government has had to strike eight different deals with each state and territory. $500 will be offered in NSW, Victoria, Queensland, South Australia and Tasmania $350 in total relief will be available in Western Australia and the territories $650 will also be available to eligible small businesses in states that have matched the relief."

                  "articleBody": "Reporting by Tim Callanan Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews has taken a swipe at previous Liberal federal governments in his reaction to last night's federal budget. Andrews said there were positive signs in the budget for Victoria, declaring \"the decade of rip off is over.\" \"You can’t fix nine years of neglect in just one budget but there are good positive signs, but we’ll keep the pressure on, of course, because we want to get our fair share,\" he said. Mr Andrews said the health initiatives announced last night were \"a good first step\" in improving medical care across the country. \"National Cabinet agreed earlier this year that health is the number one issue and it was very pleasing to see significant investments – not everything – but a big next step in last night’s federal budget. \"Particularly, longer consultations, higher payments to GPs and higher rebates particularly for vulnerable people. This is all about a better primary care system.\" Andrews said he would discuss more moves to reform the health system at a health-only National Cabinet meeting before the end of the year. There was no money allocated last night towards the 2026 Commonwealth Games, which Victoria is hosting in regional centres, but the Premier said that doesn’t mean there won’t be a federal contribution. \"The Commonwealth Games is not happening next week so we do have time and we do have some optimism that the Albanese government will be a partner,\" he said."

There were no new measures for universties this budget — but expect more to come in the future."

But here's national technology reporter, Danny Tran: Artificial intelligence is getting a boost, with the federal government tipping in $101.2 million over the next five years to help businesses integrate AI and quantum technologies. That includes expanding the National AI Centre and its role in making sure the technology is responsible (I, Robot, anyone?) as well as setting up the Australian Centre for Quantum Growth. Misha Schubert from Science and Technology Australia says this type of investment is important: \"Every time anyone enters a prompt or an instruction into ChatGPT or a generative AI tool, it is hoovering that up and building a complex profile about us. \"So [it is] really important that we diligently deepen our investments in ethical and responsible use of AI and the sort of safeguards around privacy and copyright and security on generative AI tools.\" Simon Bush from the Australian Information Industry Association, the peak body for the information and communications technology sector, says we have a \"very limited\" opportunity to get this technology right. \"We are competing with our trading partners, both friendly and not so friendly, in relation to areas like AI and Quantum,\" he says. \"This funding enables smaller Australian innovative companies to access government support, to commercialise their IP and their technology, to really bring that to the market and also [retain] really smart people, so [we] don't lose them overseas. \"It’s a really good down payment on securing Australia’s future.\""

Julie: We know that many aspects of the cost of living are at near-record highs, including rental prices, petrol, groceries and other essentials, which makes it even less sustainable for a Jobseeker recipient to live a dignified life. We saw during the pandemic that increased payments reduced measures of poverty and housing stress, but a very modest increase of $2.80 per day will sadly make little difference to many. Our political leaders must create a fair social safety net that ensures all Jobseeker recipients can afford an adequate standard of living."

                  "articleBody": "Reporting by Thomas Oriti, Anna Pykett and Wing Kuang Nationals leader David Littleproud has slammed the federal government for introducing a new fresh food tax for farmers to cover biosecurity costs. The federal budget announced a 10 per cent increase in agricultural levies to fund biosecurity activities and organisations, expecting it to raise $153 million over three years. Littleproud told ABC NewsRadio this was an \"outrageous move\". \"They are going to tax farmers to pay for the biosecurity costs of their competitors to import product into this country, and that has to be passed on to the consumer,\" he said, adding it would not help address food price inflation. He also said regional Australians would have few benefits from Labor's cost-of-living package, stressing what was needed in regional Australia was infrastructure and new childcare places. He was also concerned that new Medicare boosts would lead to the closure of regional pharmacies, meaning regional Australians might face more accessibility issues in the future. \"We feel like the forgotten Australians,\" he said."

This year's budget includes a significant investment in more social housing around the country, an increase to rent assistance, and concessions for build to rent projects. But Aimee McVeigh from the Queensland Council of Social Service said research shows a significant number of Queenslanders are missing out on access to affordable housing. \"Our research shows that we have 300,000 Queenslanders with unmet housing needs … If we can see that federally the government is committing to 20,000 social houses across the country it is clear that the current plan bears no relationship to the need,\" she said. She said despite modest rises to welfare payments, there are many Queenslanders who will continue to live in poverty. \"There is in this federal budget an increase of less than $3 a day for that payment. \"Clearly it isn't enough to go anywhere near lifting those almost half a million Queenslanders out of poverty,\" Ms McVeigh said."

That includes an increase to the JobSeeker rate by $40 a fortnight and the government’s energy bill relief plan. Victorian Council of Social Service CEO Emma King said there were positive moves in the budget to help vulnerable people. “There's critical support in there for single parents, people on low incomes who need health care, and it kicked off really important investment to retrofit low-income homes to improve energy efficiency,” she said. However, Ms King had one eye on the upcoming state budget, which Premier Daniel Andrews has repeatedly warned will be “tough”. “We've got a real challenge on our hands in terms of what we've got to look forward to in looking at the Victorian budget and where those cuts might be,” she said."

McKenzie: This is a missed opportunity to permanently lower people’s power bills. To meet the climate challenge head on, Australia needs to urgently unlock the most affordable energy source available, renewables. Sure, this Budget provides renewables assistance to 170,000 households. But when you consider the critical challenge of electrifying everything with renewable power, backed with storage, for 10.8 million households, that barely gets us off the starting blocks. The Labor Government has demonstrated in this Budget that they want to support Australians who are struggling. Climate change makes every Australian vulnerable, so the scale of investment on climate action needs to match the task ahead of us."

Eligible Western Australians will only receive a $350 electricity credit … below the $500 going to those along the east coast. From next year the state's GST payments will be slightly higher than forecast last year, growing to more than $9 billion in the 2025-26 financial year."

This time around, NSW will get $362 million over eight years, including for safety upgrades on the Bells Line of Road and Nowra Bypass planning. There's also $3 million to look at the feasibility of an intermodal terminal in Forbes, as part of the Inland Rail program. The government has said the $120 billion in the pipeline of the Infrastructure Investment Program will be reviewed, working with the states and territories to determine priorities."

Have heard nothing on this since 21 May. Presumably it's an inflationary measure, but still a game changer for those lagging behind the housing market  - Josh. Hi Josh! Thanks for writing in. I've passed on your question to political reporter Jake Evans who says: The Help to Buy scheme was funded in the treasurer's first budget in October last year. The federal government committed in that budget to $324.6 million over four years to establish the scheme to help people on low to moderate incomes to purchase a new or existing home with an equity contribution from the government. The treasurer said in his budget speech last year that the scheme would assist up to 40,000 people."

What is right about that picture?\" News Breakfast presenter Michael Rowland asks Treasurer Jim Chalmers. \"I was asked yesterday how much they'd cost and because there's an extra year of these cuts in the forward estimates, it's a bigger number than it was last name,\" Chalmers said. \"You can see the disparity between the figures and how that would be viewed by people. \"First of all, those tax cuts kick in at $45,000 and it's important that we give back some of the bracket creep in the jargon, particularly to people on low and middle incomes, but we haven't changed our position on the stage 3 tax cuts. \"What we've done in the budget last night is to provide some help for people who are doing it toughest, the most vulnerable people in our community and that shows where our priorities are. \"We haven't changed our position. They don't come in for more than a year now. They haven't actually been a focus of the deliberations for this budget at all.\""

Treasurer Jim Chalmers says \"it's a really important change.\" \"One of the most concerning parts of the community of Australians who can't find works is over-55s and particularly women over 55 ,\" he told News Breakfast. \"The advice that we receive from the expert committees we set up is that this is a big and growing challenge for us. It is harder and harder, particularly for women over 55, to get back into work. Big increases in homelessness and the like and we've tried to provide extra help there.\""

It will be boosted by 15 per cent, taking the maximum payment to $180 a fortnight for a single person. Most of the recipients are pensioners or those receiving Centrelink benefits. \"It’s good, it’s important that it’s been raised,” says Homelessness Australia CEO Kate Colvin. “When people are struggling to put three meals a day on the table, every dollar makes a difference.” The increase has been budgeted at $2.7 billion over four years. But Colvin says an extra $15.50 a week won’t make much difference to how people feel about their ability to pay the rent. “It’s just that rents have increased so much,” she says. A recent report from Anglicare found less than one per cent of private rental properties were deemed affordable. Before the budget, the Australian Council of Social Service had recommended doubling the Commonwealth rent assistance payment. Last week, the ABC spoke with 20-year-old Abby Manning, who until recently had relied on the Youth Allowance payment and Commonwealth rent assistance while studying at TAFE. After seeing the budget last night, she says the rent assistance increase wouldn’t make much difference. “I was hoping the government would take this as a chance to do something bigger and better,” she says. “Obviously I’m disappointed. I mean, it’s like two dollars a day.”",

The Treasurer says he doesn't pre-empt decisions made by the Reserve Bank board. Chalmers: Never have. Never will. Don't intend to do that today. The defining influence on our decisions around the cost of living package, our decisions around the growth package, and the historic \nrestraint that we have shown in spending has been this inflation challenge. We are supremely confident that the budget that we handed down last night will take some of these cost-of-living pressures off without adding to inflation. The Treasurer says \"such a big proportion of that spending in 23-24 is legacy issues that we had to clean up\". Chalmers: The fact that the cost of living package \nonly adds 0.1% of GDP in that period, the fact that our energy plan, the combination of the price caps and the bill relief takes three-quarters of a click off inflation next year. All of these things, I think, are important demonstrations for why so many of the bank economists in particular have come out today and said at \nworst the impact on the economy is neutral and many of them have said better than that. There won't be unanimity about that, you can always find if you look hard enough, you can always find a view on either side of the spectrum.",

They’ve told national technology reporter Danny Tran that the budget is a welcome step after months of data breaches, cyber-attacks and sirens sounding over the power of artificial intelligence. Here's the latest from Danny: Misha Schubert from Science and Technology Australia says the budget will allow Australia to keep pace with the rapid scale of advancement we’re seeing on the horizon. Misha: Unless we make those deep investments, we know that Australia will fall behind, will lose competitive advantage and that will come at a cost of Australian jobs and living standards, so the race is on to keep Australia at the forefront of an array of new frontier technologies. Cybersecurity has come away as a winner with the federal government announcing $101.6 million over the next five years to boost our cyber capabilities. That bucket of cash includes $46.5 million over four years to set up a Coordinator for Cyber Security, who will be tasked with making sure Australia can manage any cyber threats coming our way. On the domestic side of things, small businesses will also get a helping hand to defend themselves against cybercriminals with a new ‘cyber wardens’ program, which will cost about $23.4 million over three years. Cash will also be pumped into stronger privacy protections for Australians.",

He says the NDIS and interest costs remain the most prominent issues, alongside health and defence and aged care. Chalmers: But those two fastest \ngrowing areas [NDIS and interest costs] are also now the most prominent areas of improvement and progress. Our commitment to banking revenue upgrades means we'll have $300 billion less debt, saving us around $83 billion of interest costs by the end of the medium-term. And while the commitments of the Prime Minister and the states on the NDIS \nwill secure its future and reduce payments growth, this combined with some modest but meaningful tax changes to improve our revenue base, all of this has contributed significantly to a marked decline in the structural deficit by the end of the medium-term.",

The budget has some support to help deal with this growing problem. Here’s more from national consumer affairs reporter, Michael Atkin: Michael: The federal government was alarmed by the record scam losses revealed last month and this budget has committed far more money to protecting Australians – in total just over $86 million over four years. The stories of those who lose everything to scammers are devastating and the financial blow can impact a family for generations or cripple a business. Victims I’ve interviewed express frustration that more isn’t being done to address gaps that are exploited by scammers on social media platforms, telco networks and in the banking system. Consumer groups have been pushing hard for banks to be made liable to repay scam funds, which they say would drive innovation. It’s something the sector has outright rejected, arguing it would reduce personal responsibility. The biggest ticket item in the budget is establishing a National Anti-Scam Centre to be run by the consumer watchdog, the ACCC — a move first announced in November. We’re still waiting on the detail but the government says it will involve government, the big banks, telcos and others to prevent and disrupt scam activity. It also says industry will be held to account with tough new codes.",

Here's what political reporter Jake Evans says: Hi Angie, people on the Carer Allowance will be eligible for up to $500 in energy bill relief - the exact amount depends on which state you live in. Grandparents who are full-time carers of grandchildren who are children of a veteran will also be made eligible for supports under the Defence, Veterans and Families Acute Support Package Act, which can include childcare, counselling, household assistance, school transport and other services. The single parenting payment is available to eligible carers and that scheme will be extended to include people with children up to 14 years of age, meaning they will receive a higher payment than they would if they were on JobSeeker. The $40 base rate increase being applied to a number of payments is not being applied to Carer Allowance.",

The federal government have allocated $12 billion in the budget to rewire the nation to build an 82 per cent renewable grid by 2030. NSW will collect $4.7 billion of that funding to unlock transmission and Renewable Energy Zones in partnership with the NSW government. The state is also expected to be a beneficiary of the $2 billion allocated to the Hydrogen Headstart program, which the Albanese government says will ensure Australia becomes a renewable energy superpower.

Those additional payments are described as being for the ABC to continue to support local news and current affairs services, and for the SBS to continue to make news content available for Chinese and Arabic speaking communities in Australia.",

Ben Bartl is the principal solicitor with the Tenant's Union of Tasmania has told The World Today any increase is welcome. \"It's the biggest increase (in rent assistance) in more than three decades and it will provide cost of living relief for many Tasmanians,\" he said. But Mr Bartl says they won't fix a broken system. \"It shouldn't be forgotten that rents across Tasmania have increased by $75 a week over the last two years. So while the increase (to assistance) will provide some cost of living relief, it doesn't go far enough.\"",

I've passed it to political reporter Jake Evans who says: There's a big \"TBC\" over the whole higher education sector, because the government is currently in negotiations with unions, universities and others to develop a \"University Accord\". That deal would be very wide-ranging, looking not only at tertiary education funding and structure, but also at student loans and loan repayment. For now, there's no new incentive schemes or loan relief, besides a technical decision by the government to forgo $21 million worth of debt it would be owed over the next decade from loans issued in 2017 and 2018 under the VET FEE-HELP program, due to delays in the transfer of those loans to the Australian Taxation Office. It means students currently paying off loans face a 7 per cent increase on June 1 when they are indexed, which will add thousands more to many student debts.",

I've put your question to political reporter Jake Evan s who says: There is no new money for long COVID management in this budget. However the federal government has committed $50 million for further research on long COVID to be paid through the Medical Research Future Fund. A parliamentary committee inquiry into long COVID and repeat infections was released just at the end of last month, which included recommendations for long COVID clinics to be established in some public hospitals, more support and education. The government is developing its national plan on long COVID which it says will consider the findings of that committee's inquiry, so we may see more on this in the future.",

The Australian Conservation Foundation's Kelly O'Shanassy welcomes investment in \"climate action, renewable energy and clean exports\", including $2 billion to speed up development of Australia's hydrogen industry and $1.3 billion towards energy efficiency in houses. \"That's really important because Australians are struggling with the cost of living and investing in energy efficiency in homes,\" she says. There was also $121 million over four years to make good on the government's promise to set up a new national body, Environment Protection Australia (EPA), as well as another $51.5 million over four years for a new environment information agency. Ms O'Shanassy says that's \"a good investment in forming a new agency\". But the public is yet to see legislation to establish a national EPA, and the Wilderness Society's Tim Beshara says the government needs to get on with it. \"The new EPA and a data collection agency is a good start for figuring out how we do address the problems that we're facing on the nature side,\" he says. \"[But] I think that's a patch-up for where we should have been. I think that should have been in last year's budget and we should have been well advanced from where we're at right now to the reform agenda.\" Both groups also say the government hasn't put any significant new money behind its ambitious goal of zero extinctions. \"There's nothing in this budget that is going to lead to additional species coming off the [endangered] list in the right way — that is not becoming extinct, but actually becoming more and more common, less and less rare,\" Beshara says. \"The Australian government has obligations for hundreds of species to have put in place a recovery plan and to fund that, and the backlog on writing those plans and implementing those plans and funding those plans is rising. \"So, until there is dedicated additional substantive funding put into endangered species recovery, things are going to continue to decline. It's hard not to see we're going to have more extinctions [under] the Albanese government.\"",

Andrews said there were positive signs in the budget for Victoria, declaring \"the decade of rip off is over.\" \"You can’t fix nine years of neglect in just one budget but there are good positive signs, but we’ll keep the pressure on, of course, because we want to get our fair share,\" he said. Mr Andrews said the health initiatives announced last night were \"a good first step\" in improving medical care across the country. \"National Cabinet agreed earlier this year that health is the number one issue and it was very pleasing to see significant investments – not everything – but a big next step in last night’s federal budget. \"Particularly, longer consultations, higher payments to GPs and higher rebates particularly for vulnerable people. This is all about a better primary care system.\" Andrews said he would discuss more moves to reform the health system at a health-only National Cabinet meeting before the end of the year. There was no money allocated last night towards the 2026 Commonwealth Games, which Victoria is hosting in regional centres, but the Premier said that doesn’t mean there won’t be a federal contribution. \"The Commonwealth Games is not happening next week so we do have time and we do have some optimism that the Albanese government will be a partner,\" he said.",

This will apply to pensioners, Commonwealth Seniors Health Card holders, Family Tax Benefit A and B recipients and small business customers of electricity retailers. The government is also increasing the Medicare levy low-income thresholds for singles, families and seniors and pensioners from July 1, 2022, which means more people will be exempt from paying the Medicare levy in their 2022-23 tax returns. For medicines, the budget includes a $2.2 billion increase to access for medicines through the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme.",

But here's national technology reporter, Danny Tran: Artificial intelligence is getting a boost, with the federal government tipping in $101.2 million over the next five years to help businesses integrate AI and quantum technologies. That includes expanding the National AI Centre and its role in making sure the technology is responsible (I, Robot, anyone?) as well as setting up the Australian Centre for Quantum Growth. Misha Schubert from Science and Technology Australia says this type of investment is important: \"Every time anyone enters a prompt or an instruction into ChatGPT or a generative AI tool, it is hoovering that up and building a complex profile about us. \"So [it is] really important that we diligently deepen our investments in ethical and responsible use of AI and the sort of safeguards around privacy and copyright and security on generative AI tools.\" Simon Bush from the Australian Information Industry Association, the peak body for the information and communications technology sector, says we have a \"very limited\" opportunity to get this technology right. \"We are competing with our trading partners, both friendly and not so friendly, in relation to areas like AI and Quantum,\" he says. \"This funding enables smaller Australian innovative companies to access government support, to commercialise their IP and their technology, to really bring that to the market and also [retain] really smart people, so [we] don't lose them overseas. \"It’s a really good down payment on securing Australia’s future.\"",

Littleproud told ABC NewsRadio this was an \"outrageous move\". \"They are going to tax farmers to pay for the biosecurity costs of their competitors to import product into this country, and that has to be passed on to the consumer,\" he said, adding it would not help address food price inflation. He also said regional Australians would have few benefits from Labor's cost-of-living package, stressing what was needed in regional Australia was infrastructure and new childcare places. He was also concerned that new Medicare boosts would lead to the closure of regional pharmacies, meaning regional Australians might face more accessibility issues in the future. \"We feel like the forgotten Australians,\" he said.",

The budget offers a $14.6 billion cost-of-living package, including a $40 per fortnight increase to JobSeeker, which the Liberal Party hasn't yet taken a position on. \"Critically, in the new initiatives that Labor has brought forward there's $2 of extra spending for every $1 of revenue. And this is the critical point: That's inflationary,\" he told RN this morning. \"What we needed was a budget that was going to take pressure off inflation, in the process then take pressure off interest rates, and of course that helps everybody. \"That's why the right budget to unite Australians, to help all Australians was a budget that was going to take those pressures away.\" You can listen to the Shadow Treasurer's full interview on Radio National with Patricia Karvelas here.",

This year's budget includes a significant investment in more social housing around the country, an increase to rent assistance, and concessions for build to rent projects. But Aimee McVeigh from the Queensland Council of Social Service said research shows a significant number of Queenslanders are missing out on access to affordable housing. \"Our research shows that we have 300,000 Queenslanders with unmet housing needs … If we can see that federally the government is committing to 20,000 social houses across the country it is clear that the current plan bears no relationship to the need,\" she said. She said despite modest rises to welfare payments, there are many Queenslanders who will continue to live in poverty. \"There is in this federal budget an increase of less than $3 a day for that payment. \"Clearly it isn't enough to go anywhere near lifting those almost half a million Queenslanders out of poverty,\" Ms McVeigh said.",

That includes an increase to the JobSeeker rate by $40 a fortnight and the government’s energy bill relief plan. Victorian Council of Social Service CEO Emma King said there were positive moves in the budget to help vulnerable people. “There's critical support in there for single parents, people on low incomes who need health care, and it kicked off really important investment to retrofit low-income homes to improve energy efficiency,” she said. However, Ms King had one eye on the upcoming state budget, which Premier Daniel Andrews has repeatedly warned will be “tough”. “We've got a real challenge on our hands in terms of what we've got to look forward to in looking at the Victorian budget and where those cuts might be,” she said.",

Extra money has also been promised for roads in Northern WA, and $16.3 million dollars for Perth to host the World Masters Games, if Australia's bid is successful. Eligible Western Australians will only receive a $350 electricity credit … below the $500 going to those along the east coast. From next year the state's GST payments will be slightly higher than forecast last year, growing to more than $9 billion in the 2025-26 financial year.",

There's also $3 million to look at the feasibility of an intermodal terminal in Forbes, as part of the Inland Rail program.

I've passed on your question to political reporter Jake Evans who says: The Help to Buy scheme was funded in the treasurer's first budget in October last year. The federal government committed in that budget to $324.6 million over four years to establish the scheme to help people on low to moderate incomes to purchase a new or existing home with an equity contribution from the government. The treasurer said in his budget speech last year that the scheme would assist up to 40,000 people.",

What is right about that picture?\" News Breakfast presenter Michael Rowland asks Treasurer Jim Chalmers. \"I was asked yesterday how much they'd cost and because there's an extra year of these cuts in the forward estimates, it's a bigger number than it was last name,\" Chalmers said. \"You can see the disparity between the figures and how that would be viewed by people. \"First of all, those tax cuts kick in at $45,000 and it's important that we give back some of the bracket creep in the jargon, particularly to people on low and middle incomes, but we haven't changed our position on the stage 3 tax cuts. \"What we've done in the budget last night is to provide some help for people who are doing it toughest, the most vulnerable people in our community and that shows where our priorities are. \"We haven't changed our position. They don't come in for more than a year now. They haven't actually been a focus of the deliberations for this budget at all.\"",

Treasurer Jim Chalmers says \"it's a really important change.\" \"One of the most concerning parts of the community of Australians who can't find works is over-55s and particularly women over 55 ,\" he told News Breakfast. \"The advice that we receive from the expert committees we set up is that this is a big and growing challenge for us. It is harder and harder, particularly for women over 55, to get back into work. Big increases in homelessness and the like and we've tried to provide extra help there.\"",

The defining influence on our decisions around the cost of living package, our decisions around the growth package, and the historic \nrestraint that we have shown in spending has been this inflation challenge. We are supremely confident that the budget that we handed down last night will take some of these cost-of-living pressures off without adding to inflation. The Treasurer says \"such a big proportion of that spending in 23-24 is legacy issues that we had to clean up\". Chalmers: The fact that the cost of living package \nonly adds 0.1% of GDP in that period, the fact that our energy plan, the combination of the price caps and the bill relief takes three-quarters of a click off inflation next year. All of these things, I think, are important demonstrations for why so many of the bank economists in particular have come out today and said at \nworst the impact on the economy is neutral and many of them have said better than that. There won't be unanimity about that, you can always find if you look hard enough, you can always find a view on either side of the spectrum.",
