Hi Natty — even if you haven't been a Latitude customer directly, you might have applied for a financial product with them years ago, before they were even known as Latitude Financial. Before the Latitude brand became a household name (and a feature on the back of the Richmond Tigers guernsey, if you're AFL inclined like myself), they were GE Money — and have quite the history, including as Coles and Myer-branded credit cards. I did a deep dive on Latitude's history back in April, which you can read below. Hopefully it sheds some light into why you might have been contacted (and sorry to hear you've been caught up in their cyber breach).",

Markets are hinting at a pause, as is one survey by financial comparison website Finder, who surveyed 39 experts and economists. More than half of those surveyed believe the cash rate will hold at the current rate of 3.85%, but senior economics lecturer at the University of Melbourne, Tomasz Wozniak thinks the cash rate could go up by 0.15 percentage points. \"The inflation is high and way above the RBA's targets,\" he said. \"It increased monthly from 6.4 to 6.8% in May. Quarterly, in seasonally adjusted terms, that's still 7.3%, it's very high. \"Prices in all groups of expenditures increased, especially in groceries and housing.\" Mr Wozniak said he'd be \"surprised\" if they didn't increase the cash rate. \"That would be working probably against their statutory obligation to curb the inflation and keeping the GDP or the Australian economy in pretty good shape,\" he said.",
