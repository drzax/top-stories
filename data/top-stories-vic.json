Some of that fire activity continues and now in the later end of the week they are working on the flood response,\" she said. She said after flood levels peak, which is expected to occur around midday, teams would be better placed to assess any damage. \"Teams will then be able to go in and assess the level of inundation, particularly in homes,\" she said. \"They've not been able to get in and do that assessment yet because the floodwaters continue to rise and a number of roads remain closed in the local community.\" The premier said the release of water at Lake Glenmaggie and Lake Eildon had been discussed at an emergency meeting last night. She said nine people had spent the night at the relief centre at Sale, and that that personal hardship payments were available for those affected by the floods. \"I want to thank local communities and local residents for heeding the warnings and making their decisions early as to how they can make themselves and their families safe in this emergency situation,\" Ms Allan said.",

Newry dairy farmer Steve Dwyer, whose property is impacted by the floods, told ABC Victorian Mornings that the peak water body should have released water from the Glenmaggie Weir earlier. “No attempt was made to drop the level of the ‘Maggie’ weir,” he says. The ABC understands water releases from Lake Glenmaggie reached 58,000 megalitres overnight. Southern Rural Water has defended its actions, stating it worked to the information available at the time. “We ran models before the events over the last couple of days and those models were based on the high end of the rainfall range in this catchment,” managing director Cameron Fitzgerald says. “The models aren't wrong, we use the best available information that we have. “And then of course, there are variations in what actually happens, where the rain falls in the particular catchment, and how that flows. He stopped short of apologising to residents, stating welfare’s been at the forefront of all decisions. “We have managed the dam in a way that has taken the peak off this flood,” Mr Fitzgerald says. “Unquestionably the dam being there has reduced the amount of flooding downstream.”",

In a statement earlier today, Australian Federal Police said they were investigating the threats against Senator Thorpe, but would not discuss the protection arrangements in place for individuals.

This morning, she spoke to ABC Radio Adelaide, and said the referendum had caused \"division\", and that the nation is \"suffering from gaslighting, manipulation, emotional blackmail\". \"Australians want what's best for us all, including our most marginalised Indigenous Australians,\" she said. \"Why should we as a group of Indigenous Australians be relegated to an entity and told that our prime minister will only listen to us if we've got the stamp of approval through this Voice?\" Senator Price was asked about the disparity in incarceration rates between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians, and said the nation had not taken the \"right approach\" to that issue. \"If we tackle the issue of domestic and family violence better, then we will see rates of incarceration drop for Indigenous Australians,\" she said. Senator Price was also asked about whether colonisation had led to adverse outcomes for Aboriginal Australians today. \"To continually tell Aboriginal people 'you are a victim of our past' – you're effectively removing their agency,\" she said. \"If you look at the likes of the proponents of the Voice, while they're not living traditional lives, they're very much living the same sorts of lives as other everyday Australians.\"",

He writes: Here desperate locals swap out ever-growing wads of pesos for US dollars, even though the so-called \"blue dollar\" exchange is done at just half the official rate. It's a dodgy deal many are willing to make in a country where annual inflation is running at more than 100 per cent and the pesos in your hand are worth less all the time.

Here's a snapshot of his note: \"The Australian economy is on shaky ground. Trade data suggest that net exports will have become a drag o n GDP growth in Q3. The data show that while exports of goods and services rose by a solid 4% m/m, imports of goods services fell 0.4%. We wouldn't read too much into the strength in exports. Rural goods exports slumped by 2.6% m/m, while non-rural good exports barely managed to tread water. Given that commodity prices strengthened in August, that suggests export volumes probably fared poorly. Goods imports fell by 1% m/m. However, even that outturn was massaged by 7% rise in intermediate imports, which in large part reflects higher oil prices. In other news, the ABS made significant upward revisions to its monthly household spending indicator series to align it better with the national accounts data. The latest data suggest that monthly household spending rose by a nominal 4.8% y/y in August, up from 3.4% in July. However, with inflation still running hot, that still implies that household spending fell by 0.4% in August. And overall the data suggest that real consumer spending could contract outright in Q3. As long as the household spending data are right about the trajectory of consumer spending, it still seems likely that private consumption will have weakened markedly last quarter. The upshot is that it seems increasingly likely that a recession is now underway in Australia .\"",

But here's an interesting number from ABARES (the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences): Broadacre farms are predicted to see their incomes fall 41 per cent this financial year. The executive director of ABARES, Dr Jared Greenville, says it'll take incomes back to levels seen three years ago. \" Livestock farms will be affected by large decreases in prices for beef cattle and sheep, with sheep farm incomes forecast to be well below average.\"​ \"We are expecting incomes well below the long-term average in parts of northern New South Wales and southern Queensland and the northern parts of the Western Australian cropping zone, mainly due to drier conditions resulting in lower crop yields. ​\"Incomes are also forecast to be well below average in parts of southern Victoria and South Australia, as well as parts of Tasmania and Western Australia, due to a combination of dry conditions and declining sheep, lamb, and wool prices. ​\"It's important to note these numbers are based on price and weather forecasts from early September. Prices for cattle and sheep have fallen further in recent weeks so there is likely more downside risk to these forecasts than upside at present.\" I wonder if that will flow through to the checkout...
