Nomura Australia's Andrew Ticehurst thinks the Reserve Bank will put rate hikes on ice for now because of the new data. \"We now think this will provide the RBA with sufficient ammunition to deliver another 'pause' at its policy meeting next week. \"However, we are reluctant to call the end of the hiking cycle at this point, and think it appropriate for the market to price in another 0.25 per cent of hikes over coming months, on a balance-of-risks basis.\" CreditorWatch chief economist Anneke Thompson says consumers have well and truly responded to the RBA's tightening measures. \"This result has reduced the chance of a further cash rate rise at the August meeting. \"It now seems that labour force data will become more crucial to the RBA's decision making. \"The board will be hoping to see some softening in the unemployment rate, to reduce the chance of further pressure on wages.\" EY's chief economist Cherelle Murphy thinks the fall in inflation over the June quarter is a cause for optimism. \"The slowing in the quarterly rates of price growth eases pressure on the Reserve Bank to raise rates again in August, with the data suggesting that its dozen rate hikes since May 2022 are working as planned. \"But with inflation still far above the Reserve Bank’s 2-3 per cent target band, and some ongoing upside risks to wages and food prices, we are not out of the danger zone yet.\" Stephen Smith from Deloitte Access Economics thinks the Reserve Bank has gone too far in increasing borrowing costs. \"Excessive inflation in Australia has mostly been caused by supply side factors, meaning that interest rate increases have mostly been ineffective at bringing inflation under control. \"Rather, inflation has fallen as a result of repairs to global supply chains and an easing of import prices. \"The Australian economy is softening dramatically, the pace of inflation has peaked and is moderating quickly, wage growth is not excessive and medium-term inflation expectations are not rising.\" However, Jarden chief economist Carlos Cacho told Alicia Barry on the ABC News Channel that the official cash rate could go to 4.6 per cent because inflation remains too high .",
