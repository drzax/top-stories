Funding plans had to change because earlier in the week US-based Albemarle Corp withdrew its $6.6 billion buyout bid, citing 'growing complexities.' The withdrawal came days after Hancock Prospecting (Gina Rinehart's company!) raised its stake to 19.9% of Liontown (which would have been enough to block the Albemarle bid of $3 per share). The Kathleen Valley project is widely regarded as one of the world's top five lithium projects, and Liontown has already signed deals to supply Ford Motor and Tesla.

The ASX 200 is down -1.15% to 6,901 at 10:30am (AEDT). The broader All Ordinaries index is also down about the same, to 7,092 points. Only one sector is currently (slightly) up: that's energy (+0.23%). The other 10 sectors are lower, led by basic materials (-1.55%), academic and educational services (-1.42%) and real estate (-1.35%). Liontown Resources shares have tanked as much as 35% in early trade, their worst intraday drop since 2015. Shares had been suspended after US giant Albemarle withdrew its $6.6 billion takeover offer earlier this week, citing 'growing complexities.'
