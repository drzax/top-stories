Opposition upper house leader Georgie Crozier says a parliamentary inquiry is needed to restore trust in government and provide answers. \"It needs to be undertaken so we can get to the bottom of what went wrong,\" she told the chamber. The government tried in a last ditch attempt to stop the inquiry going ahead, introducing an amendment to have the auditor-general investigate instead, but that wasn't successful. The inquiry will provide an interim report by April 30, 2024, and final report by April 2025. The committee will be made up of three government, three coalition and three crossbench members.",

Employee households were most affected by rising mortgage interest charges, but higher prices for food, insurance, and housing increased the cost of living for everyone. The ABS says living costs for employee households rose 1.5 per cent over the June quarter, the largest increase of all household types. Over the year, living costs for employee households increased by 9.6 per cent, the most on record. Higher food and utilities prices pushed up the cost of living for all households. Insurance premiums rose across house, house contents, and car insurance. Eating out, takeaway food, and fruit and vegetables increased, as did strong demand for rental properties which is pushing up the cost of housing. The ABS's Living Cost Indexes includes mortgage interest charges, while the Consumer Price Index measures the cost of new dwellings. It says increasing interest rates saw the cost of living rise from between 6.3 per cent to 9.6 per cent, higher than the 6 per cent annual increase in the CPI. Mortgage interest charges rose by 91.6 per cent over the year.",

That compares to just over 13 million Australians who only hold one job, meaning that 6.6% of all workers are holding down multiple positions. Before COVID, the proportion of workers doing multiple jobs was fairly steady between 5-6%, but has remained above that level since December 2021. On average, multiple job holders worked longer hours than those with only one position. The average multiple job holder worked 30.9 hours a week in their main job and 9.6 hours in their secondary one, for a total of 40.5 hours — above a standard working week. Single job holders worked 35.5 hours per week on average. Men with multiple jobs worked the longest hours, on average, at 45.3, women with multiple jobs worked an average of 36.4 hours a week in paid employment. Women were more likely to hold multiple jobs (7.7%) than men (5.7%). Those aged 20-24 were most likely to hold more than one job (8.9%), while 7.9% of employed 15-19-year-olds also held more than one job. Only 5.5% of employed people aged 60-64 and 5.2% of those working aged 65 or older worked more than one job. Those working in agriculture, forestry and fishing, administrative and support services, arts and recreation, accommodation and food services, healthcare and social assistance, and education and training had the highest rates of multiple job holding (all above 7%). Those employed by utilities, financial and insurance firms, wholesalers, manufacturers and logistics firms were the least likely to hold multiple jobs (less than 5%).",
