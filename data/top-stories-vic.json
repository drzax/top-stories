But since the start of 2023, virtually all opinion polls have shown a steady decline in support. It's clear that backers of change are starting this sprint to the finish on the back foot. Rather than careening from poll to poll, we're keeping an eye on all the polls together, using a mathematical model that averages the polls into a single trendline. This is not a prediction of the outcome of the referendum, just our best effort at understanding what the polls are collectively saying! According to that model, the Yes case has, on average, 45.3 per cent support. If the referendum were held today, the polls would have to be out by significantly more than they were in the 2019 election for Yes to come out ahead nationally. Just note that our uncertainty interval is really quite wide at the moment (between 41.8 per cent and 49 per cent). That's partly because there haven't been any national polls published in more than a fortnight! It doesn't mean this referendum is done and dusted already. Today is clearly a big reset for both sides. And it seems that groups like Yes23 have been building up a significant campaign fund for a push in the final weeks. But things have clearly been trending in the direction of No. A significant number of people have flipped from Yes to No this year. The big question is: Can the Yes campaign make the most of this campaign period and flip enough of them back to their side? Oh, and one more thing. Winning the national vote is just one of the conditions for the referendum to pass. A majority of states need to vote yes too, and it is entirely possible for at least three states to vote no while the nation votes yes.",

Republican Governor Bill Lee asked politicians to consider a \"red flag\" law and other public safety measures in the wake of the murder of three children and three staff members at The Covenant School in Nashville in March. But fellow Republicans, who hold a supermajority in the state legislature, would not budge on their refusal to pass any laws they deem as threats to citizens' right to own guns under the US Constitution. Two Democratic politicians confronted House Speaker Cameron Sexton as Republicans voted to end the special session on Tuesday. A brief scuffle between the two Democrats, representatives Justin Jones and Justin Pearson, and the Republican speaker broke out, with shoves exchanged before other members stepped in to separate them. Extra funds have been set aside for existing safety programs, prompting the governor to say that \"our state is safer today as a result of this session.\" Sarah Shoop Neuman, the parent of a Covenant student who has lobbied for new gun laws told reporters it was difficult for her to comprehend that children were murdered at school, yet politicians \"took no meaningful action\".
