The Insurance Council of Australia, Master Builders Australia, and the Planning Institute of Australia, supported by the Australian Local Government Association, want planning rules changed so no more homes are built in high-risk flood prone locations. They held an industry round table to day to press their case. Planning ministers will report this year on developing a national standard for considering disaster and climate risk, and end development on flood plains. Here's Andrew Hall, chief executive of the Insurance Council of Australia. \"The flood events of 2022, with almost 300,000 disaster-related claims costing around $7 billion, has driven up premiums and has resulted in affordability constraints for those at highest risk.\" Matt Collins, chief executive of the Planning Institute of Australia, says new risk based policies are needed to avoid or minimise exposure to floods. \"Planning is a critical tool for influencing the level of future disaster risk, and our changing climate means we need to act now to limit the impact of extreme weather on our communities.\" Councillor Linda Scott, president of the Australian Local Government Association: \"Australia’s 537 councils play a vital role in building resilient communities, assisting in every corner of the nation to ensure our communities can better prepare for, respond to and recover from increasing natural disasters.\" \"It’s crucial we rebuild damaged local infrastructure to a more resilient standard.\"",

All resolutions put forward by a group of minority shareholders, who hold a 5 per cent stake, at an extraordinary general meeting today were defeated. The investors wanted to remove all four non-executive directors from the board in a campaign called \"Save Our Bubs,\" saying the four, including chair Katrina Rathie, had presided over \"the destruction of our great company.\" They also wanted former A2 Milk Asia boss Peter Nathan to become the new chief executive. In May, Bubs Australia sacked chief executive and co-founder Kristy Carr for allegedly failing to comply with reasonable board directions, however Ms Carr and sacked former executive chairman Dennis Lin are suing the firm for wrongful dismissal. Ms Carr has been leading the \"Save Our Bubs\" campaign. Chair Katrina Rathie says the company expects to appoint a new chief executive next month and has worked hard to improve board governance structures and transparency. \"Excluding the requisitioners' votes, the board receiving resounding support and a clear mandate from more than 70 per cent of voted shares.\" \"We acknowledge there is a lot of work to do, there are significant challenges, as well as great opportunities ahead and that shareholders expect to see a reversal of the company's performance over the past two years.\" The dissident investors put up former Elders deputy chairman James Jackson for the role of chairman, but he did not get enough votes. However, this battle is not over. Bubs Australia shares have slumped 13 per cent today. Watch this space.",
