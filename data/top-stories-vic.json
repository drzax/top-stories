              "plaintext": "Here's the latest from financial news service Reuters on the debt woes afflicting Country Garden, one of China's main real estate developers: Chinese property giant Country Garden's shares plunged to fresh record low on Monday, while its offshore bonds were also pressured after its onshore paper was suspended from trading as its debt problems deepened. Shares of Country Garden shed more than 15% to HK$0.83 in morning trading, dragging down the Hang Seng Mainland Properties Index, which dropped 4.6%. The stock has lost nearly 50% so far this month. Country Garden's offshore bonds also eased, with a few trading at the lower end of 6 cents on the dollar. Its January 2031 bond traded at 6.071 cents as at 0228 GMT, according to data by Duration Finance. In separate filings during the weekend, the firm said it would suspend trading in 11 of its onshore bonds from Monday, and their resumption of trading would be determined at a later date. The move followed reports on Friday that the company was heading for a debt restructuring, after it missed payments of two dollar bond coupons due on Aug. 6 totalling $22.5 million. Six cents in the dollar on a bond implies an extremely low degree of confidence that investors will get anything back on their loans to Country Garden. Definitely one to watch, along with Evergrande and a raft of other Chinese developers that are in deep financial bother.",
