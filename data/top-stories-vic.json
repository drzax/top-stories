              "plaintext": "Russian mercenary chief Yevgeny Prigozhin has posted his first video address since leading a short-lived mutiny in late June. Prigozhin appears in a clip, possibly shot in Africa, on Telegram channels affiliated with the Wagner group. In the video, he is seen standing in a desert area in camouflage and with a rifle in his hands. In the distance, there are more armed men and a pickup truck. Reuters was not able to geolocate or verify the date of the video, but Prigozhin's comments and some posts in the pro-Wagner channels suggested it was filmed in Africa. \"The temperature is +50 - everything as we like. The Wagner PMC makes Russia even greater on all continents, and Africa - more free. Justice and happiness - for the African people, we're making life a nightmare for ISIS and Al-Qaeda and other bandits,\" Prigozhin says in a video. He then says Wagner is recruiting people and the group \"will fulfil the tasks that were set\". The video is accompanied by a telephone number for those who want to join the group. The future of Wagner and Prigozhin has been unclear since he led a short mutiny against the Russian defence establishment in late June and the Kremlin said he and some of his fighters — who have fought in some of the fiercest battles of the Ukraine war — would leave for Belarus. Since the mutiny, some Wagner fighters have moved to Belarus and started training the army there. In comments published in late July, Prigozhin also says Wagner is ready to further increase its presence in Africa",

It's a tragic reminder that nobody should be dying at work or suffering serious injuries. Its full-year 2023 results: Full-year underlying profit: down 37% to $US13.4 billion Attributable profit after tax from total operations: down 58% to US$12.9 billion Revenue: down 17% to $US53.8 billion Underlying EBITDA: $US28 billion (-31%) The mining giant says its revenue decreased primarily as a result of significantly lower prices for iron ore, metallurgical coal, and copper. It says while it increased copper, iron ore and nickel sales volumes, and exchange rates were favourable, its profit from operations and EBITDA declined primarily due to lower commodity prices and the impacts of inflation on its cost base, particularly on labour, diesel and electricity prices. BHP shareholders will receive a full-year dividend of $US1.70 per share. The profit results were slightly weaker than analysts expected.",
