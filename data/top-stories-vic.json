We want humanitarian supplies of food, water, medicine, fuel to reach people in desperate need,\" she told reporters in Adelaide. Ms Wong said that while Israel has a right to defend itself, it also has an obligation to follow international law. \"I've said that, in affirming our view, that Israel has a right to defend itself, Israel's friends including Australia have emphasised that the way Israel does that matters,\" she said. \"We know that Hamas is a terrorist group, we know that it has burrowed itself into civilian infrastructure, we know that it's using civilians as a shield. We know that terrorism must be confronted. \"All of these challenges do not lessen Israel's obligation to observe international law and the rules of war. Even in war, there are rules. \"The international community will not accept ongoing civilian deaths.\"",

They have been supported by a staff in Egypt, transborder to Cairo and travel arrangements are being made for them to get home free of charge,\" she said. The ambassador confirmed there were children among the cohort of people who left Gaza among some of the first foreign nationals to cross the border through Rafah. \"I could hear children in the background and I said to him, are there kids? And he said yes, some of the Australian children who made it to Cairo today,\" Ms Wong said. \"They had a seven journey which is pretty tiring. I asked about the health of all the Australians, he said that people seemed in good health and were relieved but we are insuring anyone who needs medical attention will receive it. \" Ms Wong thanked DFAT staff and other Australian agencies for their work in Canberra and on the ground in Egypt and Israel in contributing to the outcome. She also thanked her counterparts in Egypt, Qatar Israel and the US for brokering the arrangement. The work continues to bring the remaining Australians, perfmanent residents and their families home, she said. \"I know how distressing the situation is for them and for their next of kin. Please be sure, we will continue to press for all of you to cross the border in Gaza, we will continue to do what we've been doing for the last few weeks which is to engage with all that we can to ensure safe passage.\"",
