She spoke to freelance journalist Muthanna Al Najjar, who followed Hamas militants into Israel two weeks ago, despite not being involved in the group. Muthanna saw the breach in the fence separating Gaza from Israel and went through, eventually travelling to the Nir Oz kibbutz where Hamas committed atrocities. \"I had never traveled this far. I was seeing the other side of the wall for the first time,\" he says. Muthanna, 39, took his camera into the kibbutz and documented the terrifying events. \"I felt compelled to record everything I witnessed,\" he says. \"Had I not recorded, no one would've believed my account of what transpired.\" His goal wasn't to sensationalise or stir animosity but to portray the unvarnished truth, allowing his lens to reveal the stark reality of war. Twenty people were killed in the kibbutz and another 80 were taken hostage. Nir Oz Kibbutz lies in the northwestern Negev desert, nestled between Magen and Nirim. At the time of the assault, it was home to about 400 people. Muthanna says he told gunmen not to shoot a mother and her children there, as the attack unfolded. In a chilling video previously uploaded to Instagram (which he has since removed), Muthanna videoed himself as militants zoomed past on motorcycles. \"My commitment to storytelling persists, irrespective of my personal feelings and the horrific scenes around,\" he says. Since 2007, Gaza has been under a blockade, severely limiting Palestinians' mobility outside Gaza. Muthanna says the experience had been difficult personally. \"I have loved ones, and their safety weighs on me daily. They're innocents,\" he says.",
