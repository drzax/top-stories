Barclays economists Shreya Sodhani and Rahul Bajoria say rate hikes remain possible as the RBA makes its monthly decisions for the rest of the year. \"The RBA paused again today with data since the last meeting not enough to warrant a hike.\" \"Incoming Governor Bullock has said that decisions will be made month by month, completely based on data, which suggests that RBA meetings through quarter four (December quarter) could be 'live', dependent on data out turns.\" \"We expect rate cuts to start in quarter two (next year).\" While the Commonwealth Bank's Belinda Allen thinks rates have peaked at 4.1 per cent, Ivan Colhoun, chief economist at National Australia Bank says another small rate increase may be needed. \"The persistence or otherwise of services inflation, which is still accelerating in Australia, has been behind NAB's expectation of a further final rate rise in November, along with continuing near-term resilience in the labour market.\" Mr Colhoun thinks there will be little change to monetary policy under Michele Bullock. \"Our expectation is that Governor Bullock will not represent a discrete change in policy thinking, or is easily characterised as either more hawkish or more dovish than Governor Lowe.\" \"We expect a common sense and straight forward approach to policy and communication.\" He says the new Monetary Policy Board with more external members will have a bigger impact on interest rate decisions than the new governor.",

CreditorWatch chief economist Anneke Thompson spoke to my colleague Alicia Barry on the ABC News Channel. \"I am in the camp that interest rates have peaked.\" \"There would have to be something quite surprising and shocking movement in inflation from here for them to go any higher. \" She sees rates on hold until next year because of high services inflation like the cost of rent and insurance. \"I think the earliest we might see interest rates declining maybe mid next year and that is because the services inflation side is still too high.\" Ms Thompson says higher interest rates are hurting younger households in particular. \"The interest rate rises have definitely hit the consumer.\" \"Not just mortgage holders but renters as well, that younger aged cohort, 25 to 18 year-olds, and 25 to 34 year-olds who are feeling the pinch.\" \"It is a consumer recession out there but hitting different generations at different ways.\" And CreditorWatch is seeing the average size of company invoices declining and trade payment defaults rising slowly. Ms Thompson says that means more businesses going under. \"Which means there are certain suppliers out there and customers who cannot pay their bills on time, and when we see that data starting to rise we know that business failure rates are going to rise 6 to 12 months down the track.\"",
