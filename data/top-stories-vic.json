Russia's TASS news agency has identified the plane that crashed as a Brazilian Embraer jet known as the Legacy 600, one of the best private jets on the market. The following Embraer jet, registration number RA-02795, is identified by Flightradar24 as belonging to the Wagner group: The flight tracking website showed it dropped off the radar at 6:11pm local time (1:11am AEST). The Legacy 600 first entered service in 2002, according to International Aviation HQ, with almost 300 produced until production ceased in 2020. There is only one recorded accident involving a Legacy 600. In 2006, an Embraer Legacy 600 crashed midair into a Gol 737-800 on its way from the factory in Brazil to the United States. Despite damages to the aircraft, the pilot landed the plane and there were no deaths or injuries. A subsequent inquiry attributed blame to the crew rather than any mechanical failure.",

He won 16 singles titles, the biggest being the Miami Open crown in 2018, his most successful season. \"After 17+ years on the @atptour, it's time to say goodbye to professional tennis,\" Isner said on social media site X, formerly known as Twitter. \"This transition won't be easy but I'm looking forward to every second of it with my amazing family. The @usopen will be my final event. Time to lace 'em up one last time.\" The towering North Carolina native crushed an ATP-record 14,411 aces in his career and has the fastest serve ever officially recorded, a 253 kph bomb he unleashed in the first round of the 2016 Davis Cup. He came out on the winning side of the longest pro tennis match in history, which lasted 11 hours and 5 minutes and took place over three days at Wimbledon in 2010. After 183 games in that match, Isner defeated qualifier Nicolas Mahut in the first round. Wimbledon would later institute a rule change to ensure a similarly long match would not take place again.

They believe heat seeping up from the base of an extinct underwater volcano helps their eggs hatch faster. \"There are clear advantages of basically sitting in this natural hot tub,\" says Janet Voight, an octopus biologist at the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago. The researchers calculated that the heated nest location more than halves the time it takes for eggs laid there to hatch — reducing the risk of them being munched by snails, shrimp and other predators. The nesting site, which the scientists dubbed an \"octopus garden\", was first discovered in 2018 by researchers from the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary and other institutions. The team used an underwater remote vehicle to film the throng of nearly 6,000 octopus nesting 2 miles deep. \"It was completely incredible — we suddenly saw thousands of pearly-coloured octopus, all upside down, with their legs up in the air and moving around. They were pushing away potential predators and turning over their eggs,\" marine biologist Andrew DeVogelaere says.",

Its preferred underlying pre-tax profit measure figure is $2.5 billion, and comes after Qantas posted a $1.4 billion profit in its half-yearly results in February. It's the first time since 2019 that Qantas has reported an annual profit, after three years of sustained losses during the COVID-19 pandemic, which grounded the aviation industry. Today’s annual results for the airline are the last from Alan Joyce as CEO before he hands the reins to chief financial officer Vanessa Hudson in November.",

There's a lot of criticism of the airline, which in recent years has sacked thousands of workers, lost bags and been accused of running down the brand, to the extent that outgoing CEO Alan Joyce last year said it was \"routinely letting customers down\". How will shareholders feel later today? And central bankers will meet in the US resort of Jackson Hole. In winter it gets incredible snow and I'd really like to visit, so you're going to be subjected to GIFs like this until I can arrange a \"study tour\" to preview future meetings. US indicies closed up overnight, the Dow was +0.5% to 34,472.98 points, the broader S & P 500 +1.1% to 4,436.01 points and the tech-laden Nasdaq +1.59% to 13,721.03 points. More to come!
