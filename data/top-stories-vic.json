The benchmark stock index is on track to snap a four-day losing streak, with all major sub-indices in positive territory. The interest-rate sensitive financial sector advanced 1%, with the \"big four\" banks gaining between 0.5% and 1.4%. Meanwhile, traders awaited further economic stimulus from China - Australia's biggest trading partner - after data showed a slowing momentum in economic recovery with consumer spending also impacted. Mining giants BHP, Rio Tinto and Fortescue Metals rose over 1% each.

The Westpac-Melbourne Institute index of consumer sentiment rose 2.7% in July to 81.3 points, the biggest gain since April when rates were also kept on hold. However, any score below 100 points means the pessimists outnumbered optimists. The survey's measure of family finances compared to a year ago remained gloomy with a fall of 4.9%, reflecting cost of living pressures. \"The key message is that sentiment is probably not going to stage a sustained lift from current deeply pessimistic levels until inflation is much lower and interest rates are firmly on hold,\" said Westpac chief economist Bill Evans. The RBA held rates steady at 4.1% last week, in the middle of the survey period, but warned that it might have to hike again to bring inflation to heel. Monthly inflation data for May showed a welcome slowdown to 5.6%, but core price measures remained stubbornly high. In a positive sign for demand, the survey's measure of whether it was a good time to buy a major household item rose 3.1% in July, while its index buying dwellings jumped 6.2%.",
