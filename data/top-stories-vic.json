Even the Reserve Bank of New Zealand had forecast that the country's economy would fall into a recession later this year. New Zealand's current cash rate sits at 5.5%, and their central bank had been aggressively hiking rates, in stark contrast to what we've seen in Australia. And now figures from Stats NZ show that most parts of the economy slowed, with business services hitting the brakes the most, falling 3.5%. \"Management consulting, advertising, scientific, and engineering design services drove the fall in business services,\" said Stats NZ's Jason Attewell. The last time New Zealand experienced a recession was in September 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, when it experienced its worst quarterly GDP fall on record. But New Zealand's economy bounced back out of the recession in the following quarter. You can read more about New Zealand's race to recession from business editor Ian Verrender below:",

A commonly accepted technical definition of recession is two consecutive quarters of declining gross domestic product (GDP), which is the key measure of a country's economic activity. Stats NZ reported a 0.1% fall in GDP over the first three months of this year, backing up a downwardly revised 0.7% slump in economic activity during the final three months of last year. New Zealand's economy still grew 2.9% over the past year, due to strong growth in the June and September quarters, but a rapid string of interest rate rises has taken all the momentum away over more recent months. The Reserve Bank of New Zealand's (RBNZ) cash rate currently sits at 5.5% and it was amongst the first central banks to start raising rates to combat inflation. The RBNZ started raising rates from a record low of 0.25% in October 2021, more than half a year before the Reserve Bank of Australia started raising rates here in May 2022.",
