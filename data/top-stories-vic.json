The report found PwC engaged in a \"deliberate strategy over many years\" to cover up the breach, and has recommended PwC publicly disclose further details about those involved in the leaking of confidential tax documents. Speaking on RN Breakfast this morning, Treasurer Jim Chalmers said he wants to see more transparency and scrutiny of PwC. \"Certainly we want to see an element of transparency here, and the committee is capable of doing their work without my guidance necessarily,\" he said. \"We need to know more information certainly, we need to know much more about what's happened here as part of our efforts to make sure it doesn't happen again. \"There's a committee process doing a great job, there's the AFP referral, there's all of our other efforts, as well. \"We will get to the bottom of this, and we will make sure that it doesn't happen again. \"It is deeply, deeply disappointing, completely unacceptable, and the government and the parliament more broadly is acting decisively to deal with it.\"",
