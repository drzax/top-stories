The number of dwellings in the country has increased by 1.5 per cent, so there's a big gap there, and when demand is strong and supply's weak, prices go up. \"There's always a tendency to try and come up with short-term solutions, [but] there aren't short-term solutions here. \"The solution has to be putting in place a structure that makes the supply side of the housing market more flexible, and that means zoning and planning deregulation and it means state and local governments being part of the solution.\" You can watch his full response below:",

I've been involved in the interest rate setting process for a number of decades, and no politician has indirectly or directly put pressure on the bank during that period. \"It's one of the very positive things about Australia — is that the political class do not put pressure on the central bank.

Jean Carroll defamed him by accusing him of rape, after a jury awarded her $US5 million for defamation and sexual abuse but not rape. The former president has asked the federal appeals court in Manhattan to overturn an August 7 decision by US District Judge Lewis Kaplan that also rejected some of his defences in a second defamation lawsuit by Ms Carroll. Both cases stemmed from Mr Trump's denials that he raped Carroll in a Bergdorf Goodman department store dressing room in Manhattan in the mid-1990s. A trial in the second lawsuit is scheduled for January 15, 2024, but Mr Trump wants it put on hold during his separate appeal against Judge Kaplan's June 29 refusal to dismiss it. Ms Carroll's lawyers opposed that request, saying she had waited long enough, and the public would be \"poorly served\" by granting Mr Trump an \"effectively indefinite delay\".",
