There wasn't a sector that finished in positive territory, with academic and educational services shedding the most, down 4.1%. The technology sector was down 2.6%, while real estate dipped by 2.4%. That said, it wasn't all bad news — some companies finished the day with some modest gains. The top five performers for the day were: NRW Holdings +2.6% Telix Pharmaceuticals +1.8% Bellevue Gold +1.6% Collins Foods +1.5% Liontown Resources -1.4% The worst performers of the day were: Johns Lyng Group -11.9% Gold Road Resources -8.3% Megaport -8.2% Polynovo -6.2% Magellan Financial Group -6.2% That's it for today's markets blog — thanks for your company throughout what was a fairly muted day. Overnight, we'll find out what the Bank of England chooses to do with interest rates — although last night's inflation data suggests a 0.25 percentage point hike is pretty much confirmed. We'll have the roundup of the decision, and reaction from the markets overnight in tomorrow's blog.

As for miners, Gold Road is down 8.6%, and BHP has dipped by 2.1%, and BlueScope Steel has had a 2.9% decline.
