Jens Haaning, 58, was commissioned by the Kunsten Museum to reproduce two works using the cash — Danish kroner and euros — to represent the annual salary in Denmark and Austria. A Copenhagen court has ordered Haaning to refund the museum 492,549 kroner ($AU70,480), which is equivalent to the sum the museum had given him minus the artist's fee and the mounting cost. Museum director Lasse Andersson previously told AFP that he laughed out loud when he first saw the two blank canvasses in 2021, and decided to show the works anyway. He said they have a \"humouristic approach\" and were \"a reflection on how we value work\". But he said the museum would take Haaning to court if he didn't pay back the money, which he refused to do. Interviewed on TV2 Nord television, Haaning said the museum had made \"much, much more\" money than what it invested thanks to the publicity surrounding the affair.",

Local television station Fox 35 says more than a dozen popular rides at the Orlando theme park were closed after the bear was sighted in a tree, including the Haunted Mansion and Pirates of the Caribbean rides. Lisa Thompson, a spokesperson for the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, said in a statement that the bear was likely searching for food in the area. \"During the fall, bears are more active as they search for food to pack on fat reserves for the winter,\" she said. \"In most cases, it is best for bears to be given space and to move along on their own. \"But given this situation, staff have captured the animal and are relocating the bear out of the park to an area in or around the Ocala National Forest.\"",

It's a momentus time with Ms Bullock the first female governor in the central bank's history. The Reserve Bank review recommended a communications shakeup at the bank after former governor Philip Lowe's poorly chosen comments that interest rates were unlikely to rise until 2024. And the communications revolution has begun! First, soft questions from a junior reporter as Ms Bullock walked in the front door of RBA headquarters in Sydney yesterday, then a YouTube video where Ms Bullock explains how interest rates operate.

Around Australia's coastline there are around 1 million tonnes of pipelines, fixed rigs, and floating vessels. Much of the infrastructure is due to be decommissioned and operators are required to clean up the sites. Back in August 2009, the Montara wellhead platform owned by PTTP Australasia in the Timor Sea suffered a well head blowout that caused an uncontrolled leak of oil and gas. The spill was not contained until November2009, the worst oil spill in Australia's history. So could it happen again? As my colleague Linton Besser reports, while oil and gas firms are legally required to clean up their sites, some don't want to pay the cost, which is estimated at more than $60 billion.",
