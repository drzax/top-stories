Lithium miner Liontown (which is the subject of a takeover) saw some huge trades today - with about 92 million shares trading hands today. See my earlier post - but there are rumours Gina Rinehart might have something to do with it. It jumped up as much as 9.4 per cent during the day but pulled back ever so slightly to close out the session 9 per cent higher. Chalice Mining was runner up in the top ten today, closing 7.93 per cent higher. It's less clear why, but it might have something to do with a broker note from UBS - it's has taken its 'sell' rating off the mineral exploration company. At the other end of the table, Super Retail Group was the poorest performing stock today as 7 .56 per cent was wiped off its share price. It traded ex-dividend today. While it was it's biggest intraday drop sine May, the stock is up about 20 per cent this year. Finally I can't not mention BHP, which accounts for about 10 per cent of the value of the ASX. It lost 5.18 per cent off its share price as it also traded ex dividend today, posting its biggest intraday drop too. Poor trade data out of China probably also weighed on the iron ore miner today. China's exports fell 8.8 per cent in August, year on year, as imports contracted 7.3 per cent.",

You might remember that I travelled to the tiny town of Elliott (population just 287!) earlier this year to speak to locals there about the split between Sun Cable's two early backers, Mike Cannon-Brookes and Andrew Forrest. Elliott had been earmarked as the closest town to the site of the export project's massive solar farm. But locals there were getting fed up with project delays and Sun Cable's voluntary administration, that came after a split between the two billionaires over its vision to export solar to Singapore. I still remember one local's message to MCB and Forrest: \"Get your act together\". As of today, MCB formally controls Sun Cable through his venture Grok, with local partners including Quinbrook. And MCB reckons it is still very much possible to generate mass amounts of solar in central Australia, and send it through to Darwin and then onto Singapore via a sub-sea cable. \"I acknowledge some people might think it's too ambitious, we don't believe it is,\" MCB told journalists in a briefing this afternoon. \"Frankly, the technology exists to make this happen. \"The next commodities boom in this country will not be founded on coal. It will be founded on the generation and export of our renewable energy. \"Sun Cable is a world changing project and will be at the heart of Australia's drive to become a renewable energy superpower. \" However, a final investment decision still hasn't been made. MCB says it'll come after talks with Singapore. He also confirmed that while the project will still very much continue to be based on sun, that it may also locally encorporate wind power. And as for his message to Elliott? He didn't confirm if it is still the chosen site of Sun Cable's solar farm when asked by ABC News, but did say he though the town's frustration was \"totally understandable\". \"I wouldn't have wished this to be the path of the company and the project it has to take. I can understand the confusion and uncertainty.\" \"I'm hopeful that we're not just exiting from that process, right? We are relaunching the project with new vim and vigor and commitment.\"",
