The World Health Organization says it \"is not functioning as a hospital anymore\". But hundreds of patients and doctors are still there. \"It's my hope and expectation that there will be less intrusive action relative to the hospital,\" Biden told reporters here in Washington. \"The hospital must be protected,\" he added. The Gazan health ministry says 32 patients, including three babies, have died since the hospital lost power. It says 36 babies are among patients are at risk of dying because life-saving equipment, including incubators, can't function. The premature babies have been wrapped in foil and placed next to hot water to keep them alive, the director of the medical center, Dr Muhammad Abu Salmiya, has told CNN. \"There is no more water, food, milk for children and babies… the situation in the hospital is catastrophic.\" Israel has repeatedly claimed there is a Hamas command center under the hospital. Hamas and hospital officials say this is untrue. Reporting with AP",

He accused Israel of \"procrastinating and evading\" the price of the deal. Israel has previously rejected international calls for a ceasefire, which it says would only prolong the suffering by letting Hamas regroup. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has consistently said that there will be no ceasefire without the return of all of the more than 240 hostages captured by Hamas during its October 7 terrorist attack on southern Israel. US President Joe Biden's national security adviser Jake Sullivan said the White House would like to see longer humanitarian pauses for days in the context of a hostage release.

The Australian share market is likely to start its day with solid gains, with ASX futures up 0.9%. That’s despite Wall Street’s main stock indexes making very little progress in either direction (ie. flat) as investors await the latest US inflation figures (on Wednesday AEDT). This data will determine whether the US Federal Reserve will keep interest rates elevated, and its timing for a rate cut – which the market is betting will happen next year. Traders have priced in a nearly 86% chance that the Fed will hold interest rates in December, according to the CME Group's FedWatch tool. Meanwhile, the Australian dollar was slightly higher at 63.8 US cents (after rising 0.2% overnight). Later this morning, NAB and Westpac will release their business conditions and consumer sentiment reports, which provides a useful snapshot of how the economy is tracking. However, the key Australian data to look out for is the ABS’s Wage Price Index and Labour Force report (out on Wednesday and Thursday). Oil prices jumped overnight after the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) published a monthly report which eased worries about waning demand in the United States and China. Brent crude futures rose 1.2% to $US82.43 a barrel. In its report, OPEC said oil market fundamentals remained strong and blamed speculators for a recent drop in prices. OPEC made a slight increase to its 2023 forecast for global oil demand growth and stuck to its relatively high 2024 prediction.",
