The European Cave Rescue Association says Mark Dickey was in the cave in Turkiye's Taurus Mountains when he experienced gastrointestinal bleeding. In a video message from inside the cave and made available by Turkey’s communications directorate, Dickey thanked the caving community and the Turkish government for their efforts. \"The caving world is a really tight-knit group and it’s amazing to see how many people have responded on the surface,\" said Dickey. \"I do know that the quick response of the Turkish government to get the medical supplies that I need, in my opinion, saved my life. I was very close to the edge .\" Dickey, who is seen standing and moving around in the video, said that while he is alert and talking, he is not \" healed on the inside\" and will need a lot of help to get out of the cave. Experts said the rescue operation could take days or even weeks depending on conditions.",
