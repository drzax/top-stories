Unlike in federal and many other state cases, the names of those jurors are listed in the indictment, which has reportedly led to doxing. In a statement, the Fulton County Sheriff’s office says it \"is aware that personal information of members of the Fulton County Grand Jury is being shared on various platforms\". The Sheriff’s office says the matter is being taken \"very seriously\" and it’s working to track down the origins of the threats. Some online posts reportedly suggested jurors were harassed, but it’s not clear whether that has actually happened. It all adds to the tension around Fulton County, Atlanta, where Trump and his co-defendants have been given until the end of next week to appear at the Rice Street jail to be booked in the case, which is expected to involve the former president having his mugshot taken.",

AAP reports Football Australia is set to challenge Saudi Arabia for hosting rights to the 2026 Women's Asian Cup. The organisation has also been ambitious in its desire to bid for hosting rights to the men's World Cup in 2034 and the revamped Club World Cup in 2029. But the Women's Asian Cup in 2026 looms as a much more attainable proposition. Football Australia CEO James Johnson tells AAP: \"(A successful bid) would extend this window for a major growth in the Australian game which is really being turbocharged by the women's game. \"There's a lot of logic for that bid, it's calculated because women's football is growing rapidly around the world and in particular in Australia. \"We've seen the success of the Matildas at this World Cup and we know when we hosted the Asian Cup in 2015 that was a big success. \"We're taking it seriously and we're working with state and federal governments to make sure we have the right backing to get that over the line.\"",

Now the Wall Street Journal is reporting that SpaceX had $US373 million worth of Bitcoin in 2021 and 2022, but has since sold it — and it's this report that has caused the cryptocurrency to drop substantially this morning.

For the unfamiliar, \"doom loop\" or (\"urban doom loop\") was coined by a professor at Colombia University to describe the downward spiral some cities are facing — like San Francisco, which is in the midst of an opioid crisis, high housing costs, and tech boom all at once. In layman's terms, it's a cycle of one negative condition feeding another negative condition, which feeds another negative condition, and so it goes. But NAB's head of markets, Ray Attrill, has plagiarised the term (his words, not mine) to describe what's currently happening in currency markets. He explained that the \"ongoing appreciation\" of the US dollar and Japan yen — which hit a new high of ¥146.56 overnight — is causing an aversion from China when it comes to the Chinese yuan and Japanese yen exchange rate (which is especially relevant given China and Japan are competing over manufacturing high-end goods like electric vehicles). Comparatively, the US dollar and Chinese yuan exchange rate hit its highest level since November 3 overnight, and that's ricocheted throughout the Asia-Pacific. It's that flow on effect that caused the NZ dollar to plummet to 59.03 US cents overnight, and sending the Aussie dollar down to 63 US cents (the lowest for both currencies since early November). Given the additional uncertainties China's economy is facing, we can expect to see this loop to continue for a while yet.",

Back in March, the company disclosed it had been the target of a cyber attack that saw millions of Australians have their personal data compromised, and is considered to be one of the largest cyber breaches in Australian history. Latitude is reporting a statutory loss (after tax) of $98.2 million, which includes $76 million of \"pre-tax costs and provisions relating to the March cyber incident\". Its cash profit is also down 88% to $7 million. Compared to last year, cash net profit after tax came in at $86 million. In an investor presentation, Belan noted that the \"cyber disruption\" impacted their the volume of sales, but it is slowly picking back up. It noted that before the cyber attack in January and February, its volume was up 12.5%, and is down 3% year on year — but as of June this year, volume has returned to June 2022 levels. Latitude also notes that while it is now focused on safely restoring business operations, significant financial risks remain because of the cyber attack, including: Regulatory fines Legal claims and/or class actions Technology review The company has also told investors there will be no first-half dividend.",
