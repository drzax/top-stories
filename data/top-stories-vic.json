Disaster chaplains and community support are made available to residents and a space has been set up for people who want to pay their respects or need assistance. Williams says the island, which is home to about 3,500 people, is a very small and tight-knit community. \"Everybody knows everybody and, at the same time, they're all there to make sure that they support each other,\" she says. \"I just think they are still reeling at this whole event.

This event attracts thousands of people in and linked to the resources sector from Australia and around the globe. Deloitte has crunched some numbers about WA-listed companies on the ASX – finding the WA Index outperformed the broader ASX 200 through FY 23. It ended the financial year up 21 per cent, with a combined value of $363.3 billion. The vast majority of that comes down to the mining sector. Even though commodity prices broadly are off their peaks, there's still growth in some company spreadsheets. \"The index performance this year comes unphased by the broader commodity markets which did it tough,\" said Deloitte Western Australia Audit & Assurance partner Dave Andrews. \"Pockets of optimism in uranium, gold, lead and tin were outweighed by significant price retractions across many of the commodities surveyed. \" \"It is clear that battery-based solutions are critical to the electrification of vehicles and general mobility and it's no surprise battery technologies, EVs and lithium stocks are the talk around town, \" Mr Andrews added. Here are Deloitte's Top Three movers in the WA Index Top 20 for the year ended 30 June 2023: Liontown Resources – market capitalisation up 169.5% to $6.2bn Pilbara Minerals – market capitalisation up 115.1% to $14.7bn De Grey Mining – market capitalisation up 85.1% to $2.1bn I'll be here in Kalgoorlie all week. Tonight on The Business I sit down with Pilbara Minerals boss Dale Henderson. With the lithium price falling, and Pilbara Minerals announcing expansion plans, it'll make for an interesting conversation.",

The ANZ-Indeed job ads index rose 0.4% in July. That was after a downwardly revised 2.7% slump in June. However, despite the trend being in decline for job ads, Indeed's Asia-Pacific economist Callam Pickering says demand for labour remains robust. \"Despite a more challenging economic environment, job creation remains exceptionally strong,\" he wrote. \"ANZ-Indeed Job Ads are around 50% above pre-pandemic levels. \"Quite simply, there is still an incredible number of jobs available across the nation. Certainly enough to absorb high immigration and keep unemployment low.\" \"Australia's labour market remains tight with the unemployment rate 3.5% and just 1.2 unemployed people per job vacancy nationwide, compared to 3.1 unemployed people before the pandemic. \"Talent and skill-shortages remain widespread and recruitment challenges are among the biggest impediments for businesses looking to expand.\" The jobs market is one factor that is still keeping another potential interest rate rise on the table. Although some economists who worked through the last non-pandemic recession in Australia warn that the jobs market often looks fine early in an economic downturn, until it suddenly deteriorates. #ICYMI last week, Alicia Barry's interview with NAB chief economist Alan Oster is well worth watching.",

The FWO said 25 cleaners were underpaid a total of $99,637 between February and June 2017 due to being on \"unlawfully low flat rates\". The agency says Fair Work Inspectors attended the football ground (then known as Etihad Stadium) in Melbourne after a 2017 AFL match to speak with cleaners and gather evidence, following an anonymous tip-off. The cleaners have been back-paid in full, and now their former employers have been fined by the court. The FWO said that Quayclean Australia Pty Ltd, a national cleaning company that holds the principal contract to provide cleaning services at the stadium, has been penalised $174,420. Ranvel, a Melbourne-based company formerly subcontracted by Quayclean to provide some of the cleaning services at the stadium, has been penalised $114,480. Indika Udara Lokubalasuriya, owner-director of Ranvel, has been penalised $15,552. Harjot Singh, who was a director of Melbourne-based company Lionheart Workforce (which entered liquidation in September 2019 and was deregistered in October 2020), which was also formerly subcontracted by Quayclean to provide some cleaning services at the stadium, has been penalised $28,512. The FWO said Lionheart and Mr Singh paid 11 cleaners flat hourly rates ranging from $7 to $23, resulting in total underpayments of $75,138.26. Ranvel and Mr Lokubalasuriya paid 14 cleaners a flat rate of $16 per hour, resulting in total underpayments of $24,498.80. Judge Caroline Kirton found that all respondents had deliberately contravened workplace laws, noting that Quayclean had admitted knowing the funds it paid Lionheart and Ranvel were insufficient to enable the companies to comply with award rates of pay.",
