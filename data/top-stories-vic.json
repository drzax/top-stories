Australian Strategic Materials (ASM), which owns deposits in New South Wales (though is yet to mine anything and sources its rare earths ore from other miners in Asia), has signed a deal with USA Rare Earth. ASM owns a rare earths processing plant in South Korea - that arm of the business has signed a five-year deal with the US company to supply neodymium iron boron alloy from 2024. Neodymium is used to make permanent magnets for things like medical imaging machines, engines and communications technology. It's shares are up more than five per cent. Liontown Resources, which mines lithium (another critical component in batteries) in the Goldfields region of WA, announced today will export lithium direct shipping ore (DSO) (the least refined product) before it exports its first concentrate (ore that's been partly refined) as way to raise some cash. Liontown has so far stockpiled 70,000 tonnes of DSO and expects to sell up to 300,000 tonnes, likely starting by the end of this calendar year. Liontown's Managing Director and CEO, Tony Ottaviano, said: \"Progressing with the production of DSO not only provides early revenue potential, but also enables us to de-risk the project by field testing our ore sorting and logistics solutions on a smaller scale ahead of first concentrate production mid-2024.\" Liontown shares are up 0.2 per cent .",

While services spending had remained pretty strong as previously locked down Australians enjoyed their freedom to travel, and eat and drink out, JP Morgan economist Tom Kennedy said almost every retail category fell in the June quarter. \" Clothing/footwear sales (+1.1% q/q) were the only category to report an increase in sales volumes, a dynamic the ABS notes owes to additional discounting/promotional activity. \" Household goods (-1.5% q/q) and department store (-1.4% q/q) sales posted the largest declines, while cafes/restaurants (-0.1% q/q) and food (-0.5% q/q) sales also lost ground.\" The overall fall in sales volumes was 0.5% for the quarter, but Mr Kennedy doesn't think the fall in household consumption as measured by the economic growth figures will be quite as steep. \"This marks the third consecutive quarterly contraction, an outcome which has happened only once (GFC) in the series' forty year history. \"We have previously noted that household spending as measured in GDP is likely to outperform the retail data given the latter largely overlooks spending in the services economy. \"We retain this view, but note that the services components of the retail report (for example, cafes/restaurants) also posted declines last quarter which suggests consumption is slowing across the board .\" Most states and territories saw declines, although Tasmania and NSW were the standout falls.

              "plaintext": "If you were wondering why the Reserve Bank didn't hike interest rates on Tuesday — and many economists were — the detailed retail sales figures offer another strong clue. We had initial monthly retail figures on Friday last week, showing a 0.8% fall in June. But that was a 0.8% fall in the value of goods and services sold, and we all know that prices have generally been going up quite a bit, so the quantity of goods and services sold likely fell even further. Well, today the ABS has released data on the volume of retail sales for the June quarter — a key component of economic growth, as measured by gross domestic product. The news is bleak. Retails sales volumes fell 0.5% in the June quarter, backing up a 0.8% plunge in the March quarter and a 0.4% fall in the three months to December 31 last year. All up, the bureau's head of retail statistics Ben Dorber says the annual number is the worst in more than three decades, if you exclude the pandemic lockdowns. \"It's the first time since 2008 that retail sales volumes have recorded three consecutive quarterly falls,\" he noted in the report. \"Retail sales volumes are down 1.4 per cent compared to the June quarter last year. \"Outside of the pandemic period, this is the first time since 1991 that sales volumes have fallen compared to the previous year.\" What was happening in Australia in the early 90s? A very, very nasty recession mainly caused by surging interest rates. Sounds like a pretty good reason for the Reserve Bank to take a break on the rate hikes for now.",
