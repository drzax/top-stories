                  "headline": "Conservation groups say the budget doesn't do enough for the environment",
                  "articleBody": "By the Specialist Reporting Team's Loretta Florance: The government came into office with a mandate to improve Australia's environmental record, but conservation groups say while the budget has some promising measures on climate change, it doesn't provide nearly enough money to back the government's ambitious agenda to do more to protect the country's natural environment. The Australian Conservation Foundation's Kelly O'Shanassy welcomes investment in \"climate action, renewable energy and clean exports\", including $2 billion to speed up development of Australia's hydrogen industry and $1.3 billion towards energy efficiency in houses. \"That's really important because Australians are struggling with the cost of living and investing in energy efficiency in homes,\" she says. There was also $121 million over four years to make good on the government's promise to set up a new national body, Environment Protection Australia (EPA), as well as another $51.5 million over four years for a new environment information agency. Ms O'Shanassy says that's \"a good investment in forming a new agency\". But the public is yet to see legislation to establish a national EPA, and the Wilderness Society's Tim Beshara says the government needs to get on with it. \"The new EPA and a data collection agency is a good start for figuring out how we do address the problems that we're facing on the nature side,\" he says. \"[But] I think that's a patch-up for where we should have been. I think that should have been in last year's budget and we should have been well advanced from where we're at right now to the reform agenda.\" Both groups also say the government hasn't put any significant new money behind its ambitious goal of zero extinctions. \"There's nothing in this budget that is going to lead to additional species coming off the [endangered] list in the right way — that is not becoming extinct, but actually becoming more and more common, less and less rare,\" Beshara says. \"The Australian government has obligations for hundreds of species to have put in place a recovery plan and to fund that, and the backlog on writing those plans and implementing those plans and funding those plans is rising. \"So, until there is dedicated additional substantive funding put into endangered species recovery, things are going to continue to decline. It's hard not to see we're going to have more extinctions [under] the Albanese government.\""

Everywhere I read it says there will be a $500 relief for energy bills for eligible households but no information as to who is eligible. - John. Hi John. Here's the lowdown from political reporter, Jake Evans: The energy relief payment will be available to pensioners, veterans, seniors and other concession card holders, as well as recipients of Carer Allowance, Family Tax Benefit and anyone eligible for existing state and territory electricity concession schemes. However, the amount you receive will differ from state to state, as the money is jointly funded and the federal government has had to strike eight different deals with each state and territory. $500 will be offered in NSW, Victoria, Queensland, South Australia and Tasmania $350 in total relief will be available in Western Australia and the territories $650 will also be available to eligible small businesses in states that have matched the relief."

                  "articleBody": "Reporting by Tim Callanan Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews has taken a swipe at previous Liberal federal governments in his reaction to last night's federal budget. Andrews said there were positive signs in the budget for Victoria, declaring \"the decade of rip off is over.\" \"You can’t fix nine years of neglect in just one budget but there are good positive signs, but we’ll keep the pressure on, of course, because we want to get our fair share,\" he said. Mr Andrews said the health initiatives announced last night were \"a good first step\" in improving medical care across the country. \"National Cabinet agreed earlier this year that health is the number one issue and it was very pleasing to see significant investments – not everything – but a big next step in last night’s federal budget. \"Particularly, longer consultations, higher payments to GPs and higher rebates particularly for vulnerable people. This is all about a better primary care system.\" Andrews said he would discuss more moves to reform the health system at a health-only National Cabinet meeting before the end of the year. There was no money allocated last night towards the 2026 Commonwealth Games, which Victoria is hosting in regional centres, but the Premier said that doesn’t mean there won’t be a federal contribution. \"The Commonwealth Games is not happening next week so we do have time and we do have some optimism that the Albanese government will be a partner,\" he said."

But here's national technology reporter, Danny Tran: Artificial intelligence is getting a boost, with the federal government tipping in $101.2 million over the next five years to help businesses integrate AI and quantum technologies. That includes expanding the National AI Centre and its role in making sure the technology is responsible (I, Robot, anyone?) as well as setting up the Australian Centre for Quantum Growth. Misha Schubert from Science and Technology Australia says this type of investment is important: \"Every time anyone enters a prompt or an instruction into ChatGPT or a generative AI tool, it is hoovering that up and building a complex profile about us. \"So [it is] really important that we diligently deepen our investments in ethical and responsible use of AI and the sort of safeguards around privacy and copyright and security on generative AI tools.\" Simon Bush from the Australian Information Industry Association, the peak body for the information and communications technology sector, says we have a \"very limited\" opportunity to get this technology right. \"We are competing with our trading partners, both friendly and not so friendly, in relation to areas like AI and Quantum,\" he says. \"This funding enables smaller Australian innovative companies to access government support, to commercialise their IP and their technology, to really bring that to the market and also [retain] really smart people, so [we] don't lose them overseas. \"It’s a really good down payment on securing Australia’s future.\""

Julie: We know that many aspects of the cost of living are at near-record highs, including rental prices, petrol, groceries and other essentials, which makes it even less sustainable for a Jobseeker recipient to live a dignified life. We saw during the pandemic that increased payments reduced measures of poverty and housing stress, but a very modest increase of $2.80 per day will sadly make little difference to many. Our political leaders must create a fair social safety net that ensures all Jobseeker recipients can afford an adequate standard of living."

                  "articleBody": "Reporting by Thomas Oriti, Anna Pykett and Wing Kuang Nationals leader David Littleproud has slammed the federal government for introducing a new fresh food tax for farmers to cover biosecurity costs. The federal budget announced a 10 per cent increase in agricultural levies to fund biosecurity activities and organisations, expecting it to raise $153 million over three years. Littleproud told ABC NewsRadio this was an \"outrageous move\". \"They are going to tax farmers to pay for the biosecurity costs of their competitors to import product into this country, and that has to be passed on to the consumer,\" he said, adding it would not help address food price inflation. He also said regional Australians would have few benefits from Labor's cost-of-living package, stressing what was needed in regional Australia was infrastructure and new childcare places. He was also concerned that new Medicare boosts would lead to the closure of regional pharmacies, meaning regional Australians might face more accessibility issues in the future. \"We feel like the forgotten Australians,\" he said."

This year's budget includes a significant investment in more social housing around the country, an increase to rent assistance, and concessions for build to rent projects. But Aimee McVeigh from the Queensland Council of Social Service said research shows a significant number of Queenslanders are missing out on access to affordable housing. \"Our research shows that we have 300,000 Queenslanders with unmet housing needs … If we can see that federally the government is committing to 20,000 social houses across the country it is clear that the current plan bears no relationship to the need,\" she said. She said despite modest rises to welfare payments, there are many Queenslanders who will continue to live in poverty. \"There is in this federal budget an increase of less than $3 a day for that payment. \"Clearly it isn't enough to go anywhere near lifting those almost half a million Queenslanders out of poverty,\" Ms McVeigh said."

That includes an increase to the JobSeeker rate by $40 a fortnight and the government’s energy bill relief plan. Victorian Council of Social Service CEO Emma King said there were positive moves in the budget to help vulnerable people. “There's critical support in there for single parents, people on low incomes who need health care, and it kicked off really important investment to retrofit low-income homes to improve energy efficiency,” she said. However, Ms King had one eye on the upcoming state budget, which Premier Daniel Andrews has repeatedly warned will be “tough”. “We've got a real challenge on our hands in terms of what we've got to look forward to in looking at the Victorian budget and where those cuts might be,” she said."

McKenzie: This is a missed opportunity to permanently lower people’s power bills. To meet the climate challenge head on, Australia needs to urgently unlock the most affordable energy source available, renewables. Sure, this Budget provides renewables assistance to 170,000 households. But when you consider the critical challenge of electrifying everything with renewable power, backed with storage, for 10.8 million households, that barely gets us off the starting blocks. The Labor Government has demonstrated in this Budget that they want to support Australians who are struggling. Climate change makes every Australian vulnerable, so the scale of investment on climate action needs to match the task ahead of us."

                  "articleBody": "By state political reporter Keane Bourke There's little in the federal budget for WA, with one of the key pledges being $11.4 million dollars to extend a defence industry training program for the state's shipbuilding sector. Extra money has also been promised for roads in Northern WA, and $16.3 million dollars for Perth to host the World Masters Games, if Australia's bid is successful. Eligible Western Australians will only receive a $350 electricity credit … below the $500 going to those along the east coast. From next year the state's GST payments will be slightly higher than forecast last year, growing to more than $9 billion in the 2025-26 financial year."

This time around, NSW will get $362 million over eight years, including for safety upgrades on the Bells Line of Road and Nowra Bypass planning. There's also $3 million to look at the feasibility of an intermodal terminal in Forbes, as part of the Inland Rail program. The government has said the $120 billion in the pipeline of the Infrastructure Investment Program will be reviewed, working with the states and territories to determine priorities."

Have heard nothing on this since 21 May. Presumably it's an inflationary measure, but still a game changer for those lagging behind the housing market  - Josh. Hi Josh! Thanks for writing in. I've passed on your question to political reporter Jake Evans who says: The Help to Buy scheme was funded in the treasurer's first budget in October last year. The federal government committed in that budget to $324.6 million over four years to establish the scheme to help people on low to moderate incomes to purchase a new or existing home with an equity contribution from the government. The treasurer said in his budget speech last year that the scheme would assist up to 40,000 people."

They don't come in for more than a year now. They haven't actually been a focus of the deliberations for this budget at all.\""

Treasurer Jim Chalmers says \"it's a really important change.\" \"One of the most concerning parts of the community of Australians who can't find works is over-55s and particularly women over 55 ,\" he told News Breakfast. \"The advice that we receive from the expert committees we set up is that this is a big and growing challenge for us. It is harder and harder, particularly for women over 55, to get back into work. Big increases in homelessness and the like and we've tried to provide extra help there.\""

The Australian Conservation Foundation's Kelly O'Shanassy welcomes investment in \"climate action, renewable energy and clean exports\", including $2 billion to speed up development of Australia's hydrogen industry and $1.3 billion towards energy efficiency in houses. \"That's really important because Australians are struggling with the cost of living and investing in energy efficiency in homes,\" she says. There was also $121 million over four years to make good on the government's promise to set up a new national body, Environment Protection Australia (EPA), as well as another $51.5 million over four years for a new environment information agency. Ms O'Shanassy says that's \"a good investment in forming a new agency\". But the public is yet to see legislation to establish a national EPA, and the Wilderness Society's Tim Beshara says the government needs to get on with it. \"The new EPA and a data collection agency is a good start for figuring out how we do address the problems that we're facing on the nature side,\" he says. \"[But] I think that's a patch-up for where we should have been. I think that should have been in last year's budget and we should have been well advanced from where we're at right now to the reform agenda.\" Both groups also say the government hasn't put any significant new money behind its ambitious goal of zero extinctions. \"There's nothing in this budget that is going to lead to additional species coming off the [endangered] list in the right way — that is not becoming extinct, but actually becoming more and more common, less and less rare,\" Beshara says. \"The Australian government has obligations for hundreds of species to have put in place a recovery plan and to fund that, and the backlog on writing those plans and implementing those plans and funding those plans is rising. \"So, until there is dedicated additional substantive funding put into endangered species recovery, things are going to continue to decline. It's hard not to see we're going to have more extinctions [under] the Albanese government.\"",

Everywhere I read it says there will be a $500 relief for energy bills for eligible households but no information as to who is eligible. - John. Hi John. Here's the lowdown from political reporter, Jake Evans: The energy relief payment will be available to pensioners, veterans, seniors and other concession card holders, as well as recipients of Carer Allowance, Family Tax Benefit and anyone eligible for existing state and territory electricity concession schemes. However, the amount you receive will differ from state to state, as the money is jointly funded and the federal government has had to strike eight different deals with each state and territory. $500 will be offered in NSW, Victoria, Queensland, South Australia and Tasmania $350 in total relief will be available in Western Australia and the territories $650 will also be available to eligible small businesses in states that have matched the relief.",

Andrews said there were positive signs in the budget for Victoria, declaring \"the decade of rip off is over.\" \"You can’t fix nine years of neglect in just one budget but there are good positive signs, but we’ll keep the pressure on, of course, because we want to get our fair share,\" he said. Mr Andrews said the health initiatives announced last night were \"a good first step\" in improving medical care across the country. \"National Cabinet agreed earlier this year that health is the number one issue and it was very pleasing to see significant investments – not everything – but a big next step in last night’s federal budget. \"Particularly, longer consultations, higher payments to GPs and higher rebates particularly for vulnerable people. This is all about a better primary care system.\" Andrews said he would discuss more moves to reform the health system at a health-only National Cabinet meeting before the end of the year. There was no money allocated last night towards the 2026 Commonwealth Games, which Victoria is hosting in regional centres, but the Premier said that doesn’t mean there won’t be a federal contribution. \"The Commonwealth Games is not happening next week so we do have time and we do have some optimism that the Albanese government will be a partner,\" he said.",

That includes expanding the National AI Centre and its role in making sure the technology is responsible (I, Robot, anyone?) as well as setting up the Australian Centre for Quantum Growth. Misha Schubert from Science and Technology Australia says this type of investment is important: \"Every time anyone enters a prompt or an instruction into ChatGPT or a generative AI tool, it is hoovering that up and building a complex profile about us. \"So [it is] really important that we diligently deepen our investments in ethical and responsible use of AI and the sort of safeguards around privacy and copyright and security on generative AI tools.\" Simon Bush from the Australian Information Industry Association, the peak body for the information and communications technology sector, says we have a \"very limited\" opportunity to get this technology right. \"We are competing with our trading partners, both friendly and not so friendly, in relation to areas like AI and Quantum,\" he says. \"This funding enables smaller Australian innovative companies to access government support, to commercialise their IP and their technology, to really bring that to the market and also [retain] really smart people, so [we] don't lose them overseas. \"It’s a really good down payment on securing Australia’s future.\"",

She says while the budget includes some positive investments to tackle the cost of living, the increase to the Jobseeker payment will do little to lift vulnerable people out of poverty. Julie: We know that many aspects of the cost of living are at near-record highs, including rental prices, petrol, groceries and other essentials, which makes it even less sustainable for a Jobseeker recipient to live a dignified life. We saw during the pandemic that increased payments reduced measures of poverty and housing stress, but a very modest increase of $2.80 per day will sadly make little difference to many. Our political leaders must create a fair social safety net that ensures all Jobseeker recipients can afford an adequate standard of living.",

The federal budget announced a 10 per cent increase in agricultural levies to fund biosecurity activities and organisations, expecting it to raise $153 million over three years. Littleproud told ABC NewsRadio this was an \"outrageous move\". \"They are going to tax farmers to pay for the biosecurity costs of their competitors to import product into this country, and that has to be passed on to the consumer,\" he said, adding it would not help address food price inflation. He also said regional Australians would have few benefits from Labor's cost-of-living package, stressing what was needed in regional Australia was infrastructure and new childcare places. He was also concerned that new Medicare boosts would lead to the closure of regional pharmacies, meaning regional Australians might face more accessibility issues in the future. \"We feel like the forgotten Australians,\" he said.",

This year's budget includes a significant investment in more social housing around the country, an increase to rent assistance, and concessions for build to rent projects. But Aimee McVeigh from the Queensland Council of Social Service said research shows a significant number of Queenslanders are missing out on access to affordable housing. \"Our research shows that we have 300,000 Queenslanders with unmet housing needs … If we can see that federally the government is committing to 20,000 social houses across the country it is clear that the current plan bears no relationship to the need,\" she said. She said despite modest rises to welfare payments, there are many Queenslanders who will continue to live in poverty. \"There is in this federal budget an increase of less than $3 a day for that payment. \"Clearly it isn't enough to go anywhere near lifting those almost half a million Queenslanders out of poverty,\" Ms McVeigh said.",

Victorian Council of Social Service CEO Emma King said there were positive moves in the budget to help vulnerable people. “There's critical support in there for single parents, people on low incomes who need health care, and it kicked off really important investment to retrofit low-income homes to improve energy efficiency,” she said.

McKenzie: This is a missed opportunity to permanently lower people’s power bills. To meet the climate challenge head on, Australia needs to urgently unlock the most affordable energy source available, renewables. Sure, this Budget provides renewables assistance to 170,000 households. But when you consider the critical challenge of electrifying everything with renewable power, backed with storage, for 10.8 million households, that barely gets us off the starting blocks. The Labor Government has demonstrated in this Budget that they want to support Australians who are struggling. Climate change makes every Australian vulnerable, so the scale of investment on climate action needs to match the task ahead of us.",

Well, it's not on a par with the $1.4 billion allocated to NSW infrastructure projects in the Labor government's first budget last October or the $3.3 billion in the Coalition's pre-election budget in March last year. This time around, NSW will get $362 million over eight years, including for safety upgrades on the Bells Line of Road and Nowra Bypass planning. There's also $3 million to look at the feasibility of an intermodal terminal in Forbes, as part of the Inland Rail program. The government has said the $120 billion in the pipeline of the Infrastructure Investment Program will be reviewed, working with the states and territories to determine priorities.",

I've passed on your question to political reporter Jake Evans who says: The Help to Buy scheme was funded in the treasurer's first budget in October last year. The federal government committed in that budget to $324.6 million over four years to establish the scheme to help people on low to moderate incomes to purchase a new or existing home with an equity contribution from the government. The treasurer said in his budget speech last year that the scheme would assist up to 40,000 people.",
