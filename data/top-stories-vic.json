The streaming giant says that starting today, Australian members who are sharing their Netflix account with people outside of their household will begin receiving an email (which you can read below) about what's going to change. The gist of it is that if you want to share your Netflix account with someone who doesn't live with you, it's now going to cost $7.99 per month to add them to your account. Otherwise, they can transfer their profile to an entirely new account. The crackdown comes as the company says more than 100 million households have shared passwords with people they do not live with. Netflix says the changes it's bringing into place will allow it to continue investing in new content. You can read more about the crackdown and why it's happening in this earlier story.

I've never seen any TikTok, actually. I've not seen the ones related to me or the ones not related to me. And I've not seen any of the AI-type stuff related to me. AP: You could look at it as a new generation discovering your films. ANDERSON: The only reason I don't look at the stuff is because it probably takes the things that I do the same again and again. We're forced to accept when I make a movie, it's got to be made by me. But what I will say is anytime anyone's responding with enthusiasm to these movies I've made over these many years, that's a nice, lucky thing. So I'm happy to have it.

His family issued a statement late last night confirming his death. \"This is to confirm that Rolf Harris recently died peacefully surrounded by family and friends and has now been laid to rest,\" the statement reads. \"They ask that you respect their privacy. No further comment will be made.\" Harris, who had neck cancer, had been receiving 24-hour care. Once one of Australia's most famous celebrity exports — renowned as a television presenter, musician and painter — Harris was prosecuted in 2013 for indecent assault against girls and young women between 1968 and 1986. A year later, convicted at London's Southwark Crown Court over 12 offences, he was sentenced to five years and nine months in jail, and was released in May 2017 on parole.",
