The broader All Ordinaries index was also flat, closing up 0.2% to 7517 points. The worst performing sectors were energy (-2.1%), academic and educational services (-1.9%) and consumer non-cyclicals (-1.1%). Whitehaven Coal had a bad day, closing down -9.2% on trading ex-dividend. Qantas shares closed down -2.5% to $5.88. The airline's shares fell on news the Australian competition regulator has taken the Qantas to court, alleging the carrier kept selling tickets for more than 8000 cancelled flights in mid 2022. The best performing sectors were technology (+1.0%), consumer cyclicals (+0.6%) and utilities (+0.5%). Harvey Norman closed up +5.2% to $4.04. The retailer reported a 30 per cent drop in yearly profit, but it was a better result than the market had expected.

They've just published some findings from a survey they did of borrowers back in June. It reveals 69 per cent of borrowers with a fixed mortgage rate don't know what their new rate will be when it inevitably rolls over to variable. Some people fixed their interest rate (back when the Reserve Bank of Australia's cash rate was 0.1 per cent ) with their lender at extremely low levels - under or about 2 per cent. Now the RBA's official cash rate is 4.1 per cent, those fixed mortgages will are starting to expire and will be put on their lender's current variable rate - many of which start with a 5. That will be quite the shock to some borrowers. The AMP survey of 1,000 people also found a quarter didn't know when their fixed rate was due to expire. About 880,000 fixed rate mortgages are rolling off their rates this year. AMP says the research shows some people lack understanding of key aspects of their home loan. Sean O'Malley, Group Executive AMP Bank said: \"AMP Bank's latest research has found there are many Australian homeowners who could be more engaged with their mortgages. Not knowing about key aspects of their home loan or how it works, could be costing them in the long run. \"Your home loan is probably the biggest financial commitment you'll make in your lifetime. Making some simple changes, for example maximising the benefits of an offset account can help you pay off your home loan sooner. \"It's a reminder of the importance of checking in on your finances and making sure your home loan is fit for purpose. I encourage all homeowners take the time to understand key features and terminology of their loan, and to ask your broker or lender if you're not sure.\"",
