Residents say Israeli tanks have been moving mostly at night with Israeli forces largely relying on air and artillery strikes to clear a path for their ground advance. Gaza's interior ministry says 900,000 Palestinians are still sheltering in northern Gaza including Gaza City. \"The most dangerous trip in my life. We saw the tanks from point blank (range). We saw decomposed body parts. We saw death,\" resident Adam Fayez Zeyara posted with a selfie of himself on the road out of Gaza City. While Israel's military operation is focused on the northern half of Gaza, the south has also come under attack. Palestinian health officials said at least 23 people were killed in two separate Israeli air strikes early on Tuesday in the southern Gaza cities of Khan Younis and Rafah. More than 10,000 people, around 40 percent of them children, have been killed since fighting began according to counts by health officials there. \"We are civilians,\" said Ahmed Ayesh, who was rescued from the rubble of a house in Khan Younis where health officials said 11 people had been killed. \"This is the bravery of the so-called Israel — they show their might and power against civilians, babies inside, kids inside, and elderly.\" UN Human Rights Commissioner Volker Turk said it \"has been one full month of carnage, of incessant suffering, bloodshed, destruction, outrage and despair.\"",
