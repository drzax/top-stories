Figures from Roy Morgan reveal 1.5 million, or 29 per cent, of borrowers were at risk of mortgage stress in July 2023 — a number higher than during the global financial crisis. While the percentage of affected people is lower than in 2008, the number of Australians at risk is higher due to growth in the population and the number of people in the mortgage market. The report also shows the number of borrowers battling to pay off loans has steadily risen since the RBA began its aggressive run of interest rate rises in May last year. It comes ahead of a speech from incoming Reserve Bank governor Michele Bullock, who will speak in Canberra tomorrow evening before she takes up the job mid-next month.
