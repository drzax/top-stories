On arrival, the 47-year-old woman allegedly threatened police with the axe before barricading herself inside a unit. Specialist tactical officers, including negotiators, arrived before police gaining entry at about 9:45pm. Police used a taser along with a number of \"tactical options\" to take the woman into custody. She was then escorted from the scene to an ambulance, however, her condition deteriorated a short time later, and she was taken to John Hunter Hospital, where she later died.
