In response, Wall Street... dropped significantly. As it stands, it looks like the S & P 500 is headed for quite a correction. Showing you that good news is sometimes bad news. It appears investors think this latest set of strong economic data means the Fed will keep hiking rates. On the flip side, 10 year Treasury yields have dropped marginally. So who really knows? Over in Europe, the ECB has kept rates on hold for the first time in 10 months. That was widely expected and the markets didn't really react that much. The central bank's statement also all but confirmed that's the end of their tightening cycle, with economic conditions there remaining weak. And here in Australia, we are headed for a subdued open. We've had a lot of appearances by the RBA this week. Here is Nassim Khadem's wrap of their new governor in front of Senate Estimates yesterday. Grab a cup of coffee. It's Friday!",
