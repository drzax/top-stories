There wasn't a sector that finished in positive territory, with academic and educational services shedding the most, down 4.1%. The technology sector was down 2.6%, while real estate dipped by 2.4%. That said, it wasn't all bad news â some companies finished the day with some modest gains. The top five performers for the day were: NRW Holdings +2.6% Telix Pharmaceuticals +1.8% Bellevue Gold +1.6% Collins Foods +1.5% Liontown Resources -1.4% The worst performers of the day were: Johns Lyng Group -11.9% Gold Road Resources -8.3% Megaport -8.2% Polynovo -6.2% Magellan Financial Group -6.2% That's it for today's markets blog â thanks for your company throughout what was a fairly muted day. Overnight, we'll find out what the Bank of England chooses to do with interest rates â although last night's inflation data suggests a 0.25 percentage point hike is pretty much confirmed. We'll have the roundup of the decision, and reaction from the markets overnight in tomorrow's blog.
