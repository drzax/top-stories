We want humanitarian supplies of food, water, medicine, fuel to reach people in desperate need,\" she told reporters in Adelaide. Ms Wong said that while Israel has a right to defend itself, it also has an obligation to follow international law. \"I've said that, in affirming our view, that Israel has a right to defend itself, Israel's friends including Australia have emphasised that the way Israel does that matters\", she said. \"We know that Hamas is a terrorist group, we know that it has burrowed itself into civilian infrastructure, we know that it's using civilians as a shield. We know that terrorism must be confronted. \"All of these challenges do not lessen Israel's obligation to observe international law and the rules of war. Even in war, there are rules. \"The international community will not accept ongoing civilian deaths.\"",

They have been supported by a staff in Egypt, transborder to Cairo and travel arrangements are being made for them to get home free of charge,\" she said.

And he said yes, some of the Australian children who made it to Cairo today,\" Ms Wong said. \"They had a seven journey which is pretty tiring. I asked about the health of all the Australians, he said that people seemed in good health and were relieved but we are insuring anyone who needs medical attention will receive it. \" Ms Wong thanked DFAT staff and other Australian agencies for their work in Canberra and on the ground in Egypt and Israel in contributing to the outcome. She also thanked her counterparts in Egypt, Qatar Israel and the US for brokering the arrangement. The work continues to bring the remaining Australians, perfmanent residents and their families home, she said. \"I know how distressing the situation is for them and for their next of kin. Please be sure, we will continue to press for all of you to cross the border in Gaza, we will continue to do what we've been doing for the last few weeks which is to engage with all that we can to ensure safe passage.\"",

The indigenous group on the Tiwi Islands allege the pipeline would impact their cultural heritage. Santos says an independent anthropologist concluded there we no underwater cultural heritage places. You can read more about the issue in the article by colleague Emilia Terzon that I've posted below. The court will sit again on November 13 to determine whether to extend the injunction.

Today, it announced to the ASX it has found multiple high-grade lithium intercepts from a recent round of drilling at its North American Lithium (NAL) project in Quebec. Quick explainer for anyone who's not familiar with mining: When companies have a site of land they want to explore to find out what they have in the ground and how good it is, they send gigantic drills hundreds of metres — even up to a thousand — into the earth to retrieve drill or core samples. The drills churn out long poles of earth, that are then cut up into smaller pieces and assessed for their quality of whatever the mineral the company is looking for. So the team at Sayona have assessed the results of 57 drill holes (giving them 14.3km worth of sample to look at!) and they like what they see. The boss of Sayona, James Brown said in a statement to the stock exchange that the results mean a potential upgrade of what they have at their site. \"Some of the intercepts from this recent drilling program are thicker and higher grade than any previously encountered, increasing confidence in NAL's mine life.\" I'll just add here, the company's share price is significantly lower than the start of the year - it was about $0.30 at the end of January - so it's still a long way off that figure. Today it's worth about $0.08 a share.",

That's after a Brookfield and EIG-led consortium increased their offer to about $9.53 a share for the Australian energy producer. The bidders say it's an 8% increase on their previous offer of $8.81 and a 70% premium to Origin's share price a year ago, before the takeover speculation began. The bid was increased after some major shareholders had indicated they would reject the previous offer. Origin's board is recommending shareholders vote in favour of the deal. But Origin's largest shareholder, AustralianSuper, says the offer remains \"substantially below\" its estimate of Origin's long-term value. AustralianSuper manages $300bn in assets. Analysts say if AustralianSuper says no, the deal needs work. \"If Australian Super is rejecting it, the likelihood of the deal going ahead is very low,\" said Jamie Hannah, deputy head of investments and capital markets at VanEck, which owns a 0.3 per cent stake in Origin. \"I think the deal is back at the drawing board at the moment.\"",
