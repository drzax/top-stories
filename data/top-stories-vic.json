Mark leaves office as he led, on his own terms and as his own man. He has been a great Premier of his proud state, an extraordinary leader for WA Labor and a trusted friend. Above all, Mark will be remembered for seeing the people of Western Australian safely through one of the most challenging crises in our nation's history. In unprecedented times, Mark always held to his convictions and always sought to do the right thing by his state. While it's true the sheer scale of his final election victory earned him a place in Australian political history, I know Mark's definition of success has always been about delivering for people, improving lives and creating progress that endures. He has done all this in spades. I wish Mark, Sarah and their family all the very best for the next chapter of their lives.",

The buoyant finish is largely thanks to gains in real estate and financials, coupled with fresh optimism out of the US after a debt ceiling deal was reached. But it wasn't all rosy on the markets — especially for the academic and educational services sector, which was down 15.9% (yes, you read that correctly). That's because of IDP Education, which has spooked investors after changes in Canada that will mean it won't be the only provider for English language proficiency tests for student visa holders. The top five winners for Monday were: BrainChip Holdings +4.7% Charter Hall Social Infrastructure REIT +4.55 Syrah Resources +4.1% Lynas Rare Earth +3.8% Cromwell Property Group +3.7% And the bottom five worst performers for the day: IDP Education -15.9% Telix Pharmaceuticals -6.1% ALS -4.2% Polynovo -3.9% Megaport -3.8% Elsewhere, the Nikkei has continued its strong performance after hitting a three-decade high, while Bitcoin has continued to gain ground.

The All Ordinaries and the ASX 200 remain more than 1 per cent higher, with some strong gains from the major miners, including BHP (+1.6%), as well as a good session for the banks, led by NAB (+1.6%). Real estate is the best performing sector, with Charter Hall Social Infrastructure REIT (+3.5%), HMC Capital (+3.4%) and Charter Hall Group (+3.3%) among the top movers. 162 of the top 200 stocks are in positive territory. The optimism on the local market and around the region has been fueled by the in-principle agreement reached to raise the US debt ceiling. But UBS chief US economist Jonathan Pingle says \"it's not over, until it's over.\" Mr Pingle says the fact that 'X-date', or the date when the government will run out of measures to meet its debts and could potentially default, has been moved to June 5, from June 1, has substantially reduced the odds of the worst case scenario being realised. \"The later X-date and agreement  being reached significantly lower the odds of negative market and economic impact.\"",
