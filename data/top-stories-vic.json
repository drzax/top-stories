The country's economy minister Robert Habeck said Germany's previous high dependency on Russia for energy supply led to the recession, and growth forecasts were much bleaker.

He started by reaffirming that the US defaulting on debt is not an option, but said while progress has been made there are some sticking points in negotiations with Speaker Kevin McCarthy. Here's some of what he had to say: \"I want to be clear that the negotiations we're having with Speaker McCarthy is about the outlines of what the budget will look like, not about default. It's about competing visions for America. \"Under my administration, we've already cut the deficit by $1.7 trillion in our first two years. But Speaker McCarthy and I have a very different view of who should bear the burden of additional efforts to get our fiscal house in order. \"I don't believe the whole burden should fall on the backs of middle class and working class Americans.\" Biden said the Republicans \"disagree\" and are instead pushing for steep cuts, which would affect teachers, police, border patrol agents, and increase the wait times for social security claims. \"I won't agree to that. I put forward a proposal to cut spending by more than $1 trillion, that freezes spending for the next two years. That's on top of the nearly $3 trillion in deficit reduction I previously proposed through a combination of spending cuts and new revenue raisers. \"I propose making the wealthy begin to pay their fair share, which will reduce the deficit. But it won't cut programs for hardworking Americans depending on those funds in order to continue big tax returns for the wealthiest Americans.''",
