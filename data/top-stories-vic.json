I know the markets in the US were up on Friday but this is the day before the RBA meeting and for the past few months investors have been really cautious the day before the RBA meeting.  Is this a sign that they think rates will remain the same? Is this uptick because of the US markets?  Or is there some secret alchemy at work, like Mars is transversing Venus while the sea urchins mate in Turkey?  - Trying to find rhyme or reason. The ASX 200 is up 0.5% in morning trade, lifting 41 points to be 7,350.20 points. The broader All Ordinaries Index of the biggest 500 companies is up 0.5% too, rising 40.5 points to be 7,541.50 points But why? This is a good question. Our commentator makes some solids suggestions as to why. The real answer is: no-one knows. The market is composed of millions of transactions where people transfer the ownership of stocks. There aren't really 'more buyers than sellers' as you sometimes hear - one must meet the other to make the trade, so the number is the same. All of this leans towards the Mars/Venus/Turkish sea urchins theory being the best answer."

The biggest bank in the nation, the Commonwealth Bank, has put out its preview of next Tuesday's budget and it spells out some assumptions that will help you frame the size of the challenge facing the nation. Here's what the bank says the government is trying to do, at the same time: maintaining fiscal discipline to assist monetary policy in bringing inflation back to the 2%-3% target range providing some targeted relief to cost-of-living pressures putting in place new arrangements to reverse the projected blowout in spending on a number of large programs (ie. NDIS, Aged care) implementing the AUKUS defence policy priorities further developing climate change policies implementing some tax reform and moving the medium-term budget outlook onto a more sustainable footing And don't forget — win the next election so you can start working on the really hard stuff! That said, there's some good news for Treasurer Jim Chalmers. There was a budget last year — in October 2022 — to enact a lot of election promises. The 2022/23 budget deficit is expected to come in well below the estimate that was made then. Data to March shows the 2022/23 deficit running at $A11.2 billion \"a substantial $A23.3 billion lower than expectations\". If you roll it over 12 months like in this chart, the budget is back to a (very) small surplus — mainly thanks to the strong labour market and company profits."

Is this a sign that they think rates will remain the same? Is this uptick because of the US markets?  Or is there some secret alchemy at work, like Mars is transversing Venus while the sea urchins mate in Turkey?  - Trying to find rhyme or reason. The ASX 200 is up 0.5% in morning trade, lifting 41 points to be 7,350.20 points. The broader All Ordinaries Index of the biggest 500 companies is up 0.5% too, rising 40.5 points to be 7,541.50 points But why? This is a good question. Our commentator makes some solids suggestions as to why. The real answer is: no-one knows. The market is composed of millions of transactions where people transfer the ownership of stocks. There aren't really 'more buyers than sellers' as you sometimes hear - one must meet the other to make the trade, so the number is the same. All of this leans towards the Mars/Venus/Turkish sea urchins theory being the best answer.",

The biggest bank in the nation, the Commonwealth Bank, has put out its preview of next Tuesday's budget and it spells out some assumptions that will help you frame the size of the challenge facing the nation. Here's what the bank says the government is trying to do, at the same time: maintaining fiscal discipline to assist monetary policy in bringing inflation back to the 2%-3% target range providing some targeted relief to cost-of-living pressures putting in place new arrangements to reverse the projected blowout in spending on a number of large programs (ie. NDIS, Aged care) implementing the AUKUS defence policy priorities further developing climate change policies implementing some tax reform and moving the medium-term budget outlook onto a more sustainable footing And don't forget — win the next election so you can start working on the really hard stuff! That said, there's some good news for Treasurer Jim Chalmers. There was a budget last year — in October 2022 — to enact a lot of election promises. The 2022/23 budget deficit is expected to come in well below the estimate that was made then. Data to March shows the 2022/23 deficit running at $A11.2 billion \"a substantial $A23.3 billion lower than expectations\". If you roll it over 12 months like in this chart, the budget is back to a (very) small surplus — mainly thanks to the strong labour market and company profits.",
