              "plaintext": "Austal USA, the company's North American subsidiary, has won an initial $US114 million ($172 million) contract for detail design of the new Auxiliary General Ocean Surveillance Ship T-AGOS 25 Class for the US Navy. The contract includes options for the detail design and construction of up to seven of the ships which, if the US Navy exercises them, would bring the total value of the contract to $US3.195 billion ($4.8 billion). The ships are primarily used for anti-submarine warfare, using towed array sonar. The ASX-listed company originally specialised in aluminium hulled vessels, such as littoral combat and fast transport ships for the US Navy, but has since expanded into more conventional steel hulls. \"The T-AGOS contract is a clear acknowledgment of Austal's capabilities in steel naval shipbuilding, that includes the Navy's Towing, Salvage and Rescue (T-ATS) ships, an Auxiliary Floating Drydock Medium (AFDM), and the US Coast Guards' Offshore Patrol Cutters,\" said the company's CEO Paddy Gregg. \"These four steel naval shipbuilding projects, and our continuing successful delivery of the Independence-variant Littoral Combat Ship and Spearhead-class Expeditionary Fast Transport programs, are positioning Austal USA exceptionally well to meet the growing demands of the US Navy and Coast Guard.\" If successful, the company will build the ships at its facility in Mobile, Alabama. The company's shares were up 25.4% to $2.00 near the end of trade today.",

It says the network changes will see its international capacity grow to around 100% of pre-COVID levels by March 2024 (up from 44% a year ago, and 84% today). Here are some of the changes coming: More flights to key destinations including Tokyo, Los Angeles and New York Frequency between Australia and Japan to double with four daily flights to Tokyo Two new international routes to launch from Brisbane Two Airbus A330s to be leased from Finnair to meet demand It says an extra 300 workers (pilots and cabin crew) will be needed by the end of the year to support the extra flying. However, some of the extra flying will be achieved by an arrangement with Finnair (Finland's flag carrier and largest airline) to operate two Airbus A330 aircraft on two Qantas routes. Outgoing Qantas CEO Alan Joyce says the rebound in demand for international travel since borders reopened has been \"incredibly strong.\" “While airlines globally are working to restore capacity to meet demand, there is still a mismatch between supply and demand for international flying,\" he said. \"But with more of our aircraft back in the air, new 787s joining our fleet and our contract with Finnair, we’ve got more seats for our customers and more opportunity for Qantas crew as we increase our own flying. “We know our customers are looking for great value and this additional capacity will also put downward pressure on fares.\"",

Look at this graph: What it's showing you is that, even before this month's 0.25 percentage point rate rise, the interest charged on CBA customers' home loans had risen more than 50%. It also also showing you that their scheduled repayments — the money actually coming out of their account each month — had risen less than 20 per cent up to April. The scary thing? Over the next few months that blue line has to move much closer to the red line. This shows most mortgage customers are yet to feel anywhere near the full impact of the rate rises that have already happened. Why? Because there is roughly a three month lag between when an RBA rate rise happens and when the higher minimum repayment amount is passed through to the customer. And this is even before the full impact of the fixed rate mortgage cliff hits. CBA's internal data shows last month was the first big step up in fixed loans rolling off onto variable rates. All of these customers are facing interest rates that have more than doubled, in many cases tripled, since they took out their fixed loans. And CBA economist Stephen Wu says those customers will also have a lag between when their fixed loan expires until their scheduled repayments rise. \"At CBA there is generally a lag of around a few months between when a fixed term loan expires and when the required mortgage repayment steps up,\" he explained. It's a reality check as to why the RBA needs to be very careful in raising rates further until it sees the effect of the hikes it's already implemented. Yesterday's jobs data is being interpreted by many economists as a likely turning point in the labour market, where unemployment turns higher.",
