The reason for the gain is still in response to Russia and Saudi Arabia announcing it would be extending its production and export cuts last Tuesday. The countries extended the voluntary cuts by a combined 1.3 million barrels per day, through to the end of the year. Brent has risen by around 20% since July 1, and the pricing above $US90 a barrel is the highest the benchmark has been since mid-November. The high oil price comes as petrol prices remain around $2 a litre, if not higher, around Australia.",

Data analysed by Ownership Matters and provided to the ABC found one in three non-executive directors in Australia's biggest 300 companies are women, but they are substantially underrepresented as chairs and chief executives. It's the second time Ownership Matters has analysed the public company boards. It found only 33 companies have boards chaired by women, while only four companies have both female chairs and CEOs. There are also 15 company directors who received more than $1 million in the 2022 financial year, with Maxine Brenner the only woman in the mix. She's on the boards o f Qantas, Woolworths, Origin Energy and Orica, but has since left Orica and joined Telstra as a director. She is also the second-highest paid Qantas board member, behind chairman Richard Goyder — who is the second-highest-paid non-executive director in the country.
