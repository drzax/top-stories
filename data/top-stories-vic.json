Competitor airline Virgin Australia has slammed the government's call in recent days, with boss Jayne Hrdlicka criticising the move in a video released to staff. Today, the Australian Financial Review published comments from Assistant Treasurer Stephen Jones, explaining why the government decision to block the extra Qatar flights was in the national interest. “We can drive prices down but if we drive them down to a level where it's actually unsustainable to run an airline, instead of having two carriers we will design our markets in a way which will make it unsustainable for the existing Australian-based carrier,\" Mr Jones told the AFR in response to their questions. Asked about Mr Jones's comment this afternoon, Mr Joyce said granting traffic rights was a bilateral exercise. \"Various countries around the world protect the national interest and I think what the [assistant] treasurer was referring to is Australians should protect its own national interest, and that is making sure we get reciprocal or other arrangements when you grant traffic rights. \"I don't think anyone would say you should grant traffic rights that would mean that you are disadvantaged in the Australian national interest and I think the assistant treasurer was saying that in our mind and we would agree with that.\"",
