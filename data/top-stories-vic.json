Of course, lifting rates comes with consequences, with mortgage borrowers and small business owners just some of those feeling the pinch. But looking at this graph in isolation, it certainly appears that rising interest rates are working to curb inflation in the economy. That said, the RBA takes in far more indicators into account than just the relationship of inflation and interest rates. (One other thing to note in this graph — the latest monthly inflation data is for May this year, so the cash rate figure is capped at the May rate of 3.85% for purposes of showing the trend.)",

Thanks for the question Kara! Lovely to hear so many of your rescue dog stories. Here's Laura V 's advice: Laura V: 'Socialisation' is an interesting word. We often want our dogs to be happy to greet other dogs, but what do our dogs want? Dogs who are fearful or anxious want the threat to go away, so ultimately we need to reframe what other dogs mean. This is really complicated because there are so many things contributing to a reactive dog's behaviour - some of which are out of our control. I'd suggest engaging a behaviourist to help work out what the triggers are and what the causes are. Then you can work on managing your environment so your dog doesn't get stressed out. This is a long work in progress, but when you see your dog start to relax and trust you, it is well worth it. Try to set your dog up for success, and avoid letting your dog get past their comfort zone. This means a lot of u-turns, crossing roads and up driveways if you do decide to continue walking him on the streets. That can be very stressful for you both, so chat with your vet and then get some gentle guidance in person from a behaviourist.",

They need to walk to keep fitness and joint movement, but we don't want to force them. What should we do? Dr Karishma 's advice: Osteoarthritis is such a common ailment affecting many of our senior pets. Whilst it is true that we should still provide gentle exercise and enrichment to our geriatric pets, it is important not to over-do it or push them beyond their limits as this can hinder them more than help them. If you find that your dog's can only walk halfway around the block, then reduce their walks to this distance. This is their way of telling you that they are not physically capable of walking further than this without being in discomfort or pain. And as they continue to age, you will likely find that the length of these walks will reduce even further. A good alternative to walking outside if they are having trouble is spending more time in the garden with them so they still get the interaction and fresh air without pushing themselves. Another good alternative is swimming or hydrotherapy for our senior pets who enjoy the water, to keep their joints moving - although this is not for everyone! And finally getting them checked out at the vet is a great idea to get them on an osteoarthritis management plan and provide pain relief where needed. And if they are not at the stage of needing pain management, there are some fantastic natural injections and oral supplements these days that can greatly improve their quality of life and get them moving more freely again.",

She is well trained, has no notable history of abuse and has been a delight to welcome into our home. Thanks Stephen and Heidi for you questions! I've put this to both Dr Karishma and Laura V. Dr Karishma: Breaking habits, especially ones that are intermittent can be a challenging and lengthy process. The first step is trying to identify the trigger for this behaviour. Some common reasons include territorial spraying if they are not desexed, from urinary incontinence, old age, osteoarthritis, dementia, stress/fear/anxiety - even to noise outside, kidney disease, diabetes, cushing's disease, or urinary tract infections/stones in the bladder. It's important to get your pet checked at the vet to identify any of these underlying issues. Once a trigger has been identified, it usually will make things easier to treat, especially if there is an underlying medical issue. If these things have been ruled out, then re-training your dog may include things like increasing toilet breaks - especially after sleep and rewarding them for peeing in appropriate places. As well as ensuring area's where they have previously urinated are thoroughly cleaned with an enzymatic cleaner that eliminates the smell so they can't recognoise that smell.And considering pheromone collars and diffuser's in the house to help they feel comfortable in their environment if they are an anxious dog. And here's Laura V's take: Laura V: Dogs will wee inside the house for a number of reasons - they have not been trained properly to go outdoors, or they have an underlying anxiety, or they have an underlying medical problem. If it is occasional, try to identify the pattern. If you can predict it, then you can prevent it, by calling your dog outside to the toilet. Putting your dog on a lead can also help as you can manage their behaviour more consistently, preventing them from sneaking away to wee in another room. There is always the possibility that your dog has an underlying infection or disease that needs to be addressed by your vet, so a check up is well worth it. Punishing dogs for having accidents inside only makes them more anxious and can make them more likely to sneak away in another room when you're not looking.",
