              "plaintext": "Heavy rain in Gaza has brought new concerns and challenges for Palestinians, many of whom are homeless and living in makeshift tents after weeks of Israeli bombardment. The start of the rainy season and the possibility of flooding increased fears that the densely populated enclave's sewage system will be overwhelmed and disease will spread. At a UN shelter in Khan Younis in southern Gaza, the rain brought dismay for displaced people who woke to find the clothes they put out to dry the night before had been drenched by rain. \"We were in a house built of concrete and now we are in a tent,\" said Fayeza Srour, who fled to southern Gaza to escape bombardment in the north. \"The nylon tarps, the tent and the wood will not resist any flooding … People sleeping on the floor, what will they do? Where will they go?\" Winters can be wet and cold in Gaza, and the enclave is sometimes hit by flooding. The World Health Organization (WHO) said last week that Gaza faced an increased risk of disease spreading because Israeli air bombardments had disrupted the health system, limited access to clean water and caused people to crowd in shelters. There are already more than 30,000 cases of diarrhoea in a period where the WHO would normally expect 2,000 cases, WHO spokesperson Margaret Harris said in Geneva. \"We've got so much infrastructural damage. We've got a lack of clean water. We've got people very, very crowded together. This is another reason why we are begging for a ceasefire to happen now,\" she said. Ahmed Bayram, a spokesperson for the Norwegian Refugee Council, said the heavy rain would impede the movement of people and rescue teams. \"It will make it harder to save people stuck under the rubble, or to bury the dead, all of this amidst ceaseless bombardment and a fuel shortage catastrophe\", he said. Facing the daunting scale of the humanitarian needs of Gaza's 2.3 million people, aid organisations have been unable to plan for the challenges posed by rain and flooding. Juliette Touma, Director of Communications at the UN Palestinian refugee agency (UNRWA), said the organisation was focused on meeting the population's needs \"here and now.\" \"We're barely able to make it from one hour to the next ourselves, because the situation on the ground is so, so, so desperate,\" she said. The rain brought relief for some displaced Palestinians in the central Gaza Strip town of Deir Al-Balah who had not been able to drink clean and fresh water in the past weeks. Some placed plastic buckets outside their tents to gather rainwater to drink. \"We have been drinking salty water for 30 days. There has been no fresh water. I have just collected this from the rainwater,\" said Um Mohammad Shahin. Over 1.5 million people in Gaza are estimated to be internally displaced, including about 778,000 people who are staying in at least 154 UNRWA shelters, according to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.

A spokesperson told the ABC that third parties aren't usually named but they confirm the SingTel Internet exchange known as STiX is to blame for sending changes to routing information that triggered the Optus crash — a meltdown that badly damaged the Optus reputation and it's now drawn Singtel into the spotlight. It comes after a report from the Sydney Morning Herald quoting an unnamed insider that its parent company in Singapore might be responsible. Optus initially declined to comment.
