Only two sectors gained territory during trade, with technology and utilities sectors up 0.5% each, while energy stocks finished flat. Basic materials and resources were the biggest losers for the day, down 0.8%, while financials finished lower at 0.6%. The top five performers for the day were: Life360 +5.7% Lake Resources +5.3% Domain Holdings +2.6% United Malt Group +2.1% AGL Energy +1.9% At the other end, Incitec Pivot remained the worst performer, down -8%. Other losses went to: Core Lithium -5.4% Sandfire Resources -4.9% Imugene -4.2% Sayona Mining -3.3% Overall, it was a fairly flat day of trading, with today's wage price data from the ABS also not really having a major impact on markets. But that might all change tomorrow when unemployment figures are released at 11:30 — and regardless, we'll be back blogging all the developments bright and early.
