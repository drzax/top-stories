Mark Wood was glorious, bowling express pace, with accuracy, seam and swing. But he wasn't on his Pat Malone. Chris Woakes was brilliant in his recall to the team, with Stuart Broad and Ollie Robinson doing exactly what you expect of England medium-fast bowlers, now that they've finally been given some classic English bowling conditions. Australia, meanwhile, are in deep ... water. ,Warner (4), Khawaja (13), Labuschagne (21) and Smith (22) are all back in the sheds, and the feast-or-famine Travis Head and flighty Mitch Marsh are at the crease. If they get into their innings, they and Alex Carey have the batting class to dig their side out of trouble, but there are a lot ifs, buts and brilliant bowling between them and parity.",
