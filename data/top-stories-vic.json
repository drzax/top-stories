Ettie Ozel, the hospital's VP of Nursing told Reuters the two elderly women were in \"good condition\". \"I was happy to see two women who arrived back with us, all in all in good condition, very emotional, happy,\" Ms Ozel said. \"We took them to the ward where they met their families; great happiness, many tears, a lot of crying, amazing people.\" Hamas said it released Ms Lifshitz and Ms Cooper on health grounds. Ms Lifshitz is a peace activist who, together with her husband, helped sick Palestinians in Gaza get to hospital for years, her grandson told Reuters. She and her husband, who is still in Hamas captivity, were kidnapped from their home at the Nir Oz kibbutz, close to the border with Gaza in southern Israel, the Israeli prime minister's office said. The two women were the third and fourth hostages to be freed. Reuters",

From here you can see down into the northern strip of Gaza, where hundreds of thousands of people have been warned to evacuate. Lots of media are positioned here to capture images of the Israeli airstrikes, which I can hear continually. They're big, loud booms that reverberate across southern Israel and Gaza. I've also been hearing artillery fire from Israeli troops training. As I've been driving around I've been seeing dozens of troop carriers, trucks and soldiers who are amassed in the south. Interestingly there's been a massive decrease in the number of Hamas rockets being sent into Israel one the last two days. I've heard only one this morning so far.",
