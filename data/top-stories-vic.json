The French leader's Israel visit for talks with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was announced late on Sunday. Seven French citizens are still missing: one of them, a French woman, has been confirmed as among the hostages taken by Hamas. Macron says the others are also thought to be hostages, but there has not yet been confirmation. AFP",
