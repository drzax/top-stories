The ASX 200 lost 0.3% to close at 7,079 points, with the All Ords mirroring that performance to close at 7,264. Japan's Nikkei was off 0.3% at 32,699 points approaching the end of trade. Hong Kong's Hang Seng was a little weaker, while mainland China's two major indices in Shanghai and Shenzen saw bigger falls above 1.5%. Swissquote Bank senior analyst Ipek Ozkardeskaya said markets are likely to remain largely unaffected by developments in Russia until they signal a major shift in the war outlook. \"The Wagner incident will likely remain broadly ignored by investors, unless there are fresh developments that could change the course of the war in Ukraine,\" she wrote. \"Until then, markets will be back to business as usual.\" Locally, the biggest gainers were gold miners, led by a 4.9% jump for Capricorn Metals, amid some search for safe havens. Graincorp was also up 2.4%, with Ukraine critical to the global supply, and therefore price, of many grains. Grocery wholesaler and hardware store operator Metcash gained 4.7% on its annual profit result. Some of the biggest losers were Syrah Resources (-6%), Imugene (-4.5%), Star Entertainment (-3.8%) and Mineral Resources (-3.5%) .",

The bank says its services are recovering following \"intermittent issues\" today. It has thanked customers for their patience as it continues to bring services back online. The ABC understands the problems were caused by internal technology issues and are not the result of any external cyber attack or interference. It is also understood that the issues did not affect all CBA customers and the bank is still trying to ascertain how many customers were affected. Staff at the bank warn that it could still take some time for all systems to operate as normal for everyone and that affected customers should be on the lookout for the possibility of failed or duplicate payments. Commonwealth Bank group chief information officer Gavin Munro apologised to those affected. \"We sincerely apologise to customers who experienced disruption to their banking services today,\" he said in a statement. \"We know how much customers depend on us and are very sorry for the intermittent service issues experienced by many people today.\"",
