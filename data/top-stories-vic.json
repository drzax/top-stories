The spot price has climbed to a five-month high, thanks to improving sentiment and data from China - the world's biggest iron ore customer. There are signs China's property sector may be starting to turn around - new bank loans surged in August - up four times on July's figures. Import volumes in China (which buys 70 per cent of global seaborn iron ore - the vast majority of that from Western Australia) are also higher. It imported 106.42 metric tons in August - the biggest amount in almost two years. Our big miners are seeing their share prices climb today: FMG +3.7% to $20.33 BHP +1.0% to $44.26 Rio Tinto +2.4% to $116.10",

Our population grew by 2.2 per cent to 26.5 million people in the 12 months to March 31 this year. Beidar Cho, ABS head of demography, said: \"13 months after international borders were re-opened, net overseas migration accounted for 81 per cent of growth and added 454,400 people to the population in the year to March 2023.\" Net overseas migration was driven by a large increase in arrivals (681,000 people) and only a small increase in overseas migrant departures (226,600 people). But the ABS thinks this pattern will be temporary, saying the number of departures will increase as temporary students start departing in usual numbers. Natural increase was 108,800 people, but that's a decrease of 18.5 per cent from last year. There were 301,200 births and 192,300 deaths registered during this time, with deaths increasing 7.9 per cent and births decreasing 3.4 per cent. Western Australia is the fastest-growing state (+2.8 per cent) followed by Victoria (+2.4 per cent) and Queensland (+2.3 per cent). The largest increase in total population was Victoria with 161,700 people, slightly more than New South Wales with 156,300 people.",
