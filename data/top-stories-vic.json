Hi Ashleigh, you've asked the question that's on a lot of people's minds right now. If you're a borrower then it's good news (as long as you weren't one of the 4,300 people who lost their jobs last month). As discussed below, the RBA (and most economists) believe unemployment needs to rise for inflation to get back under control. This is only one month's number, and the RBA would want to see more evidence that labour demand is slowing before totally backing away from further rate increases, but this data would reassure them that the rate rises they've already implemented are having an effect. This is the view from Abhijit Surya from Capital Economics : \"The unemployment rate is now likely to overshoot the RBA's forecast of 3.6% in Q2 [the second quarter]. \"Taken together with yesterday's data showing that wage growth remained sluggish in Q1, that should suffice to keep the Bank from lifting rates any further .\" AMP's Diana Mousina agrees. \"Today's soft employment figures along with the wage price data yesterday which confirmed that there Australia does not face a wage breakout problem which means that there is no urgency for the RBA to lift the cash rate at its next meeting in June. \"The central bank has previously spoken about wanting to preserve the job gains it made during the pandemic, so if that remains the case then it should prefer to hold the cash rate steady for now and assess if further rate rises are necessary.\" However, economists who were forecasting further rate rises ahead of today's data generally still are, like Sean Langcake from Oxford Economics. \"At the margin, these data weaken the case for another rate hike. \" But the labour market remains very tight and is delivering strong wage growth, which means a June rate hike will still be very close call. \"",

Both major indexes here are making strong gains on open, with both the All Ords and ASX 200 surging 0.8% on open. The biggest gains are in mining, including iron ore and lithium. A note from ANZ this morning speaks to why those stocks in particular are gaining, and it includes China. Its analysts noted that new home prices in 70 cities across mainland China have risen slightly, according to its National Bureau of Statistics. \"Price gains for new homes in China (boosted) sentiment in the iron ore market. The market is hoping this is a harbinger to a pick-up in steel output,\" ANZ notes. \"Signs that the destocking cycle in China has passed has boosted sentiment across the lithium market. \"Lithium carbonate prices in China have jumped more than 15% this week amid signs of improvement in the electric vehicle (EV) sector. \"China will speed up the building of power charging facilities for EVs in rural areas so they will be available in every province. \"Tesla has also raised prices for some models in recent weeks, raising hopes the recent price war has ended.\" Meanwhile, we have losses on the ASX in the gas industry and some retail stocks, including Lovisa. This is all ahead of the jobs data set to be released by the ABS at 11:30am AEST. We know that the Reserve Bank will be closely watching this data for signs that its ploy to tackle inflation is working or not. Here's a take by our colleague Peter Ryan. We'll also have my colleague Michael Janda on deck as the ABS jobs data is being released to answer your questions. Start sending them through on the comments!",
