                  "articleBody": "US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has notified that country's Congress that it could default on its debt as early as June 1, if legislators do not raise or suspend the nation's borrowing authority before then and avert what could potentially become a global financial crisis. In a letter to House and Senate leaders, Yellen urges congressional leaders \"to protect the full faith and credit of the United States by acting as soon as possible\" to address the $US31.4 trillion ($47.4 trillion) limit on its legal borrowing authority. She says it is impossible to predict with certainty the exact date of when the US will run out of cash. \"We have learned from past debt limit impasses that waiting until the last minute to suspend or increase the debt limit can cause serious harm to business and consumer confidence, raise short-term borrowing costs for taxpayers, and negatively impact the credit rating of the United States,\" Yellen says in her letter. In January, Yellen sent a letter to congressional leaders stating that her department had begun resorting to \"extraordinary measures\" to avoid a federal government default. The US plans to borrow $1 trillion during the April to June quarter. That's more than projected in January, due to a lower beginning-of-quarter cash balance and projections of lower-than-expected income tax receipts and higher spending."

                  "articleBody": "Police in the US state of Illinois have provided an update on a series of crashes on a local highway during a duststorm, in which around 70-100 vehicles are said to have been hit. Illinois State Police say there are reports of six fatalities, with more than 30 people being transported to hospital for injuries ranging from minor to life-threatening. Those people in hospital range from two years old to 80 years old. \"The cause of the crash is due to excessive winds blowing dirt from farm fields across the highway, leading to zero visibility,\" police say. Around 30 commercial vehicles and 40 to 60 passenger cars are said to be involved in the accidents, including two semi-trailer trucks which caught fire."

The federal treasurer has refused to confirm whether JobSeeker payments for people over 55 will be lifted for the first time in a decade. Federal Treasurer Jim Chalmers said unemployed women over 55 were the most vulnerable cohort in Australian society and the government wanted to introduce specific measures to help them. But he did not rule out the change, saying instead those details would be confirmed next week. The federal government has been under pressure to lift JobSeeker, including from its own backbench.

A further $10.1 million will be put towards improving the communications network used by first responders. Emergency Services Minister Murray Watt tells ABC News Breakfast that people in disaster areas say they hadn't received emergency messages quickly enough in the past. \"In some case they're sent to the wrong area. They might have the wrong phone provider and then not receive a message,\" he says. \"So that's what this national messaging system is all about — having one system across the country that can effectively override a mobile phone system and deliver people very targetted, very quick messages.\" The government says the emergency messages will be easy to tell apart from scam messages. You can read more about the plan for the National Messaging System, below."

Permanent ADF members will supposedly be eligible to receive a $50,000 bonus payment near the end of their initial mandatory period of service, if they commit to the military for another three years. Under the scheme, 3,400 personnel will be able to benefit within the first three years.

The RBA kept the cash rate at 3.6 per cent in April after 10 hikes in a row to tame inflation. Consumer prices rose 7 per cent over the year to March, down from 7.8 per cent — but that's still higher than the RBA's 2 to 3 per cent target. RBA Governor Philip Lowe has not ruled out further rate hikes. The market is predicting that rates will likely remain on hold when the RBA board makes its announcement at 2:30pm today, but it's not official until it's official."

The social media platform appears to be working as normal for most people on their mobile devices, luckily. Are you having any issues with Twitter? Let me know in the comments."

US General Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said in November that Russia had suffered well over 100,000 killed or wounded in the first eight months of the war. The new figures suggest that Russian losses have dramatically accelerated in recent months. The fiercest recent battles in Ukraine have been in the eastern Donetsk region, where Russia is struggling to encircle the city of Bakhmut."

Perry believes the time to say goodbye is now, especially with every founding band member over the age of 70. Frontman Steven Tyler, 75, is the oldest in the group. \"It's kind of a chance to celebrate the 50 years we've been out here,\" Perry said. \"You never know how much longer everybody's going to be healthy to do this. … It's been a while since we've actually done a real tour. We did that run in Vegas, which was great. It was fun, but (we're) kind of anxious to get back on the road.\""

Under the changes, all general practitioners will be able to prescribe flavour-free, plain packaged vapes to patients working to quit smoking. Speaking on Q & A last night, Butler said easy access to vapes had created a new generation of nicotine addicts. \"This is now the number one behavioural issue in high schools and it's rapidly becoming a serious behavioural issue in primary schools,\" he said. \"This is a very serious problem we're facing and it has exploded over the last few years. While we were focused on the pandemic, it has utterly exploded and we've got to deal with it now.\" Butler is expected to further detail the government's plans during a speech at the National Press Club from 12:30pm today ."

On Monday, a heavy presence of police converged in an area where police had reported a possible sighting of the suspect, but later 38-year-old Francisco Oropeza wasn't found despite a search by officers, scent-tracking dogs and aerial police. The false alarm was one of the first times since Friday's shooting in the rural town of Cleveland that authorities had announced a possible sighting of Oropeza. By Sunday evening, authorities said more than 250 officers from multiple jurisdictions had joined the search, and Texas Governor Greg Abbott put up $US50,000 ($75,000) in reward money for tips leading to Oropeza's capture. \"I can tell you right now, we have zero leads,\" said James Smith, the FBI special agent in charge."

A number of props, sets and costumes from beloved television shows will be sold in early June — from the bar where Sam Malone greeted customers on Cheers, to the pink outfit Barbara Eden wore in I Dream of Jeannie, to props used on the set of Breaking Bad. Other items up for auction include a tunic worn by Superman in the 1950s TV series, barware from Mad Men, and costumes from Star Trek. Comisar had dreamed of creating a museum to house his collection, but when that failed to come together, he decided it was time the items leave the temperature-controlled warehouses where he's been caring for them. \"I just decided these pieces should go back to the fans and let them enjoy them and then when that good day comes when a TV museum is effectuated, these pieces will be well cared for in the hands of passionate fans and collectors,\" he said."

In a letter to House and Senate leaders, Yellen urges congressional leaders \"to protect the full faith and credit of the United States by acting as soon as possible\" to address the $US31.4 trillion ($47.4 trillion) limit on its legal borrowing authority. She says it is impossible to predict with certainty the exact date of when the US will run out of cash. \"We have learned from past debt limit impasses that waiting until the last minute to suspend or increase the debt limit can cause serious harm to business and consumer confidence, raise short-term borrowing costs for taxpayers, and negatively impact the credit rating of the United States,\" Yellen says in her letter. In January, Yellen sent a letter to congressional leaders stating that her department had begun resorting to \"extraordinary measures\" to avoid a federal government default. The US plans to borrow $1 trillion during the April to June quarter. That's more than projected in January, due to a lower beginning-of-quarter cash balance and projections of lower-than-expected income tax receipts and higher spending.",

Permanent ADF members will supposedly be eligible to receive a $50,000 bonus payment near the end of their initial mandatory period of service, if they commit to the military for another three years. Under the scheme, 3,400 personnel will be able to benefit within the first three years. The government has identified ­recruitment and retention of personnel as an immediate priority in response to the defence strategic review.",

US General Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said in November that Russia had suffered well over 100,000 killed or wounded in the first eight months of the war. The new figures suggest that Russian losses have dramatically accelerated in recent months. The fiercest recent battles in Ukraine have been in the eastern Donetsk region, where Russia is struggling to encircle the city of Bakhmut.",

The Rock & Roll Hall of Fame band have announced the dates for their Peace Out farewell tour, which begins in September and includes 40 shows across the US and Canada. \"I think it's about time,\" guitarist Joe Perry said in an interview with The Associated Press. Perry believes the time to say goodbye is now, especially with every founding band member over the age of 70. Frontman Steven Tyler, 75, is the oldest in the group. \"It's kind of a chance to celebrate the 50 years we've been out here,\" Perry said. \"You never know how much longer everybody's going to be healthy to do this. … It's been a while since we've actually done a real tour. We did that run in Vegas, which was great. It was fun, but (we're) kind of anxious to get back on the road.\"",

The Government will allocate $234 million in next week's budget to reduce harm caused by tobacco and vaping products, including to stop the importation of non-prescription vapes. Under the changes, all general practitioners will be able to prescribe flavour-free, plain packaged vapes to patients working to quit smoking. Speaking on Q & A last night, Butler said easy access to vapes had created a new generation of nicotine addicts. \"This is now the number one behavioural issue in high schools and it's rapidly becoming a serious behavioural issue in primary schools,\" he said. \"This is a very serious problem we're facing and it has exploded over the last few years. While we were focused on the pandemic, it has utterly exploded and we've got to deal with it now.\" Butler is expected to further detail the government's plans during a speech at the National Press Club from 12:30pm today .",

On Monday, a heavy presence of police converged in an area where police had reported a possible sighting of the suspect, but later 38-year-old Francisco Oropeza wasn't found despite a search by officers, scent-tracking dogs and aerial police. The false alarm was one of the first times since Friday's shooting in the rural town of Cleveland that authorities had announced a possible sighting of Oropeza. By Sunday evening, authorities said more than 250 officers from multiple jurisdictions had joined the search, and Texas Governor Greg Abbott put up $US50,000 ($75,000) in reward money for tips leading to Oropeza's capture. \"I can tell you right now, we have zero leads,\" said James Smith, the FBI special agent in charge.",

A number of props, sets and costumes from beloved television shows will be sold in early June — from the bar where Sam Malone greeted customers on Cheers, to the pink outfit Barbara Eden wore in I Dream of Jeannie, to props used on the set of Breaking Bad. Other items up for auction include a tunic worn by Superman in the 1950s TV series, barware from Mad Men, and costumes from Star Trek. Comisar had dreamed of creating a museum to house his collection, but when that failed to come together, he decided it was time the items leave the temperature-controlled warehouses where he's been caring for them. \"I just decided these pieces should go back to the fans and let them enjoy them and then when that good day comes when a TV museum is effectuated, these pieces will be well cared for in the hands of passionate fans and collectors,\" he said.",

So what do co-chairs actually do ? It's a mix of helping put together the exclusive guest list, working with top chefs to create a specific menu (often aligned with the annual theme) and creating an atmosphere inside the event by selecting specific decor. Plus, there's the traditional hosting element, with co-chairs often taking the stage to perform during the dinner portion of the evening. Phones are strictly off limits, so sadly we never get to see any performances or interior design choices."

                  "articleBody": "Since the Met is invite-only, it's only when guests walk the red carpet that we know who made the cut. This year, there will be roughly 400 guests — similar to recent years but still lower than pre-pandemic highs of 500-600. As always, Anna Wintour and her team still get to approve every guest. Back in March, gossip tabloid Page Six reported that in Wintour's bid to narrow the guest list, the entire Kardashian clan had been culled. But it looks like the rumours were false, as Kim Kardashian posted these photos with Karl Lagerfeld's cat, Choupette, after spending some time at his office to \"get inspiration\" ahead of the event. Personally, I predict we'll spot Kendall Jenner (she was featured on Vogue's May cover which paid tribute to Lagerfeld) and I hope and pray Kylie Jenner will debut her relationship with Timothée Chalamet because that would be INTERESTING."

He was also a self-proclaimed \"big mouth,\" publicly sounding off with fatphobia. He spoke against gay men who want to adopt children, migrants, sexual assault survivors, the #MeToo movement and \"ugly\" people, without apology. \"He offended people right and left, making as much of an art out of the cutting aside as the perfectly cut double-face gown,\" New York Times fashion critic Vanessa Friedman wrote soon after Lagerfeld's death. \"He judged,\" Friedman wrote, \"and knew he would be judged himself, but he didn't care. Rather, he embraced it.\" The choice of Lagerfeld for fashion's biggest night is not without critics. At the time of the announcement, actor and activist Jameela Jamil acknowledge his fashion genius but denounce his \"distinctly hateful\" remarks, often toward women. \"Why is THIS who we celebrate when there are so many AMAZING designers out there who aren't bigoted white men?\" Jamil wrote. According to the Met, Karl Lagerfeld: A Line of Beauty, will look at \"the designer's stylistic vocabulary as expressed in aesthetic themes that appear time and again in his fashions from the 1950s to his final collection in 2019.\" Lagerfeld died in 2019 at the age of 85."

So what do co-chairs actually do ? It's a mix of helping put together the exclusive guest list, working with top chefs to create a specific menu (often aligned with the annual theme) and creating an atmosphere inside the event by selecting specific decor. Plus, there's the traditional hosting element, with co-chairs often taking the stage to perform during the dinner portion of the evening. Phones are strictly off limits, so sadly we never get to see any performances or interior design choices.",

This year, there will be roughly 400 guests — similar to recent years but still lower than pre-pandemic highs of 500-600. As always, Anna Wintour and her team still get to approve every guest. Back in March, gossip tabloid Page Six reported that in Wintour's bid to narrow the guest list, the entire Kardashian clan had been culled. But it looks like the rumours were false, as Kim Kardashian posted these photos with Karl Lagerfeld's cat, Choupette, after spending some time at his office to \"get inspiration\" ahead of the event. Personally, I predict we'll spot Kendall Jenner (she was featured on Vogue's May cover which paid tribute to Lagerfeld) and I hope and pray Kylie Jenner will debut her relationship with Timothée Chalamet because that would be INTERESTING.",

He was also a self-proclaimed \"big mouth,\" publicly sounding off with fatphobia. He spoke against gay men who want to adopt children, migrants, sexual assault survivors, the #MeToo movement and \"ugly\" people, without apology. \"He offended people right and left, making as much of an art out of the cutting aside as the perfectly cut double-face gown,\" New York Times fashion critic Vanessa Friedman wrote soon after Lagerfeld's death. \"He judged,\" Friedman wrote, \"and knew he would be judged himself, but he didn't care. Rather, he embraced it.\" The choice of Lagerfeld for fashion's biggest night is not without critics. At the time of the announcement, actor and activist Jameela Jamil acknowledge his fashion genius but denounce his \"distinctly hateful\" remarks, often toward women. \"Why is THIS who we celebrate when there are so many AMAZING designers out there who aren't bigoted white men?\" Jamil wrote. According to the Met, Karl Lagerfeld: A Line of Beauty, will look at \"the designer's stylistic vocabulary as expressed in aesthetic themes that appear time and again in his fashions from the 1950s to his final collection in 2019.\" Lagerfeld died in 2019 at the age of 85.",

This year, there will be roughly 400 guests — similar to recent years but still lower than pre-pandemic highs of 500-600. As always, Anna Wintour and her team still get to approve every guest. Back in March, gossip tabloid Page Six reported that in Wintour's bid to narrow the guest list, the entire Kardashian clan had been culled. But it looks like the rumours were false, as Kim Kardashian posted these photos with Karl Lagerfeld's cat, Choupette, after spending some time at his office to \"get inspiration\" ahead of the event. Personally, I predict we'll spot Kendall Jenner (she was featured on Vogue's May cover which paid tribute to Lagerfeld) and I hope and pray Kylie Jenner will debut her relationship with Timothée Chalamet because that would be INTERESTING.",

                  "articleBody": "That's certainly the optimistic forecasts by some, including independent economist Chris Richardson. He believes there's a chance of seeing a \"wafer thin\" surplus over the year to March, which would put treasurer Jim Chalmers in sight of the first budget surplus Australia has seen in 15 years. What's behind this potential surplus? Commodity prices, in particular booming iron ore and thermal coal prices. But that's not to say deficits will be a thing of the past — as senior business correspondent Peter Ryan explains in the clip below 👇"

                  "headline": "ASX set to slip as Reserve Bank rates decision looms",
                  "articleBody": "Good morning, it's Tuesday May 2 and you've found yourself on the ABC's markets and business blog — and what a day we have in front of us. Let's get the elephant in the room out of the way first: it's rates day. The RBA is meeting today to decide what to do with the cash rate, after leaving rates on hold at 3.6% in April. But we know that was a lineball call — in the meeting minutes published a couple of weeks later, the RBA board had considered another rise of 0.25 percentage points. So what could today's decision look like? Major banks and investors are widely predicting the RBA will leave the cash rate unchanged at 3.6%, with data last week showing inflation is slowly coming down. I'll bring you the latest on that decision when it happens at 2:30pm AEST, and all the reaction that follows. On the markets front, the Australian share market is looking to open lower this morning after ASX futures were down -0.1% to 7,336 points as of 7:30am. It follows a mixed performance on Wall Street overnight, with US financial markets largely dominated by the news that regulators had seized First Republic, before selling its assets to JPMorgan Chase to fight off another global banking crisis. First Republic is the third US bank to collapse in just two months, after Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank folded earlier this year. All in all, there's a bit on — pour yourself a coffee and let's see where the day takes us."

Let's get the elephant in the room out of the way first: it's rates day. The RBA is meeting today to decide what to do with the cash rate, after leaving rates on hold at 3.6% in April. But we know that was a lineball call — in the meeting minutes published a couple of weeks later, the RBA board had considered another rise of 0.25 percentage points. So what could today's decision look like? Major banks and investors are widely predicting the RBA will leave the cash rate unchanged at 3.6%, with data last week showing inflation is slowly coming down. I'll bring you the latest on that decision when it happens at 2:30pm AEST, and all the reaction that follows. On the markets front, the Australian share market is looking to open lower this morning after ASX futures were down -0.1% to 7,336 points as of 7:30am. It follows a mixed performance on Wall Street overnight, with US financial markets largely dominated by the news that regulators had seized First Republic, before selling its assets to JPMorgan Chase to fight off another global banking crisis. First Republic is the third US bank to collapse in just two months, after Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank folded earlier this year. All in all, there's a bit on — pour yourself a coffee and let's see where the day takes us.",
