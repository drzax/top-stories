Rallies were held in Sydney and Melbourne over the last two nights in support of Palestinians. The president of the Zionist Federation of Australia, Jeremy Leibler, said some of the slogans being chanted at the Sydney demonstration were unacceptable. \"I'm terrified when I see these marches through the city that are not holding candles and calling for peace as we see from rallies in the Jewish community when things have flared up in the Middle East,\" he told ABC Radio Melbourne. \"What we're seeing is violent protests.\" Mr Leibler said the response from Australian political leaders so far had been heartening. \"I think we've had strong, very principled support – bipartisan support – both from the prime minister, from [opposition leader] Peter Dutton, and both at the state leadership levels as well,\" he said. \"So there should be. As there was after 9/11.\" President of the Palestine Advocacy Network, Nasser Mashni, said he was disappointed by some of the language used at the pro-Palestinian demonstrations. \"It's entirely unacceptable. There is no room in our movement for anti-Semitism, any level of racism, Islamophobia, whatever,\" he said. \"Our struggle is an anti-colonial struggle for self-determination for all peoples in the holy land.\" However, he said the move to project the Israeli flag on the Sydney Opera House was hurtful for Australians with a Palestinian background. \"I'm Australian too, why don't my children matter? When the [Sydney] Opera House is lit up in the Israeli flag there was an opportunity for Australia to have a moment of bringing together all peoples to say all children matter,\" he said. \"Both the flags could have been there.\" Meanwhile, Victoria Police is investigating reports of anti-Semitic threats made in South Yarra yesterday. Police said the occupants of a car threatened a man on Toorak Road about 4pm yesterday.",

Gumatj clan leader and former Australian of the Year Yunupiŋu died earlier this year aged 74, after a lifetime spent trying to better the outcomes of his Yolŋu people in north-east Arnhem Land. Yesterday, Opposition Leader Peter Dutton equated Yunupiŋu's work towards improving his Arnhem Land community with why a Voice to Parliament wasn't needed. \"They've got a logging company, they've got a building company, they've got housing, they've got a functioning society … because of the leadership demonstrated by Yunupiŋu and others around him over the course of a long period, and that's what we want to see replicated elsewhere,\" he said. Mr Dutton's comments in Adelaide did not account for the fact that the East Arnhem local government area (LGA) remains one of the 10 most disadvantaged LGAs in Australia. In reaction, Ms Burney says she was \"shocked at that statement\". \"Yunupiŋu spent his entire life fighting for his people, fighting for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people across this country and also advocating a Voice to Parliament,\" she said. \"Quite frankly, Peter Dutton should apologise for taking the name of Yunupiŋu in vain. \"The idea that there isn't disadvantage in north-east Arnhem Land is patently ridiculous. \"Peter Dutton has no right at all to use the name of Yunupiŋu in that way.\" NOTE: Yunupiŋu's surname and image is used as per the wishes of his family.",

Qantas shares gained 0.8% to $4.94, after the airline said its chairman Richard Goyder would retire in one year's time — resisting public pressure for him to step down immediately. On the flip side, shares of Bank of Queensland fell 3.6%. This was after the bank reported its statutory full-year profit plunged 70 per cent to $124 million. BoQ also cut its final dividend to 21 cents per shares (down from 24 cents last year). Shares of Life360 (-2.7%), Regis Resources (-1.9%) and Magellan Financial (-1.7%) also suffered heavy losses.",

Here's his full statement: \"As a board, we acknowledge the significant reputation and customer service issues facing the group and recognise that accountability is required to restore trust. \"Qantas has gone through an incredibly difficult period since our operation was grounded during the pandemic. \"The recovery has not been easy, and mistakes were made.
