The $750 million takeover will turn Wyloo into a major nickel producer with Mincor's Cassini nickel sulphide deposit in Kambalda in Western Australia's goldfields region. Wyloo now owns more than 90 per cent of Mincor, allowing it to buy the rest of the firm's shares. Nickel is used in the production of batteries for electric vehicles. Wyloo is looking at building a $1 billion battery materials processing plant with nickel miner IGO in Kwinana, south west of Perth. It's the latest acquisition in the renewable energy space for Mr Forrest. “Wyloo has targeted nickel sulphides as they are the greenest and cheapest option for battery manufacturing: they have the best economics, can be processed into battery grade nickel with the lowest environmental footprint and are fully recyclable,” Mr Forrest said. Wyloo chief executive Luca Giacovazzi said the company was also looking to increase spending on exploration in the Kambalda region. “The acquisition of Mincor turns Wyloo into a fully integrated nickel business that brings together high-grade nickel production from Kambalda with our planned downstream processing facility in Kwinana,” he said. “By adding Mincor to our portfolio, we’ve introduced a producing mine alongside our long-life development projects, with all our ore bodies located in the tier one jurisdictions of Australia and Canada.” Australia is seeking to build a critical minerals processing industry.",

              "plaintext": "Car park operator Secure Parking has been accused by the consumer regulator of misleading customers. The ACCC is taking Secure Parking to court for making misleading claims about its Secure a Spot service. It alleges that over a five year period from 2017 to 2022, the company told consumers that they could reserve a parking spot when they chose, but this was not the case. ACCC commissioner Liza Carvers says Secure Parking's car parks were sometimes full before people with a booking arrived, which meant they didn't get a spot. “Some of the consumers who were unable to access the parking space they’d booked complained that they were late to, or entirely missed, appointments, events, and work commitments,” Ms Carver said. “Anyone who has ever driven into a capital city CBD will know that pre-booking a parking space helps puts your mind at ease.\" “We have commenced these court proceedings because we allege Secure Parking was not providing the service it was representing to consumers, and did not reserve a parking space after consumers had pre-booked using the Secure-a-Spot service.” ACCC is seeking penalties, compliance orders and costs against the company. Secure Parking is majority owned by Japanese car park operator Park24, which has 881 car parks and 318,000 car spaces across five countries.",
