A fire at Briagolong tripled in size overnight as it continues to push towards the Princes Highway. There are three emergency warnings in place for the region. Country Fire Authority chief officer Jason Heffernan told News Breakfast the situation is continuing to change hour-by-hour. \"We're experiencing spot fires well ahead of the main fire front and firefighters and doing their best to try and contain that fire but it is very challenging, recorded peak wind gusts of 80 km per hour is serving to be very difficult for firefighters on the ground,\" he said.",

                "plaintext": "Good morning! David Chau here, with your latest finance updates. The Australian share market is set to fall sharply this morning, with ASX futures down 1.4%. It looks like markets are increasingly accepting the possibility that interest rates could still rise in the coming months (which is bad for \"riskier\" assets like shares). However, the Reserve Bank is widely expected to keep its cash rate target on hold this afternoon, which will also be the first policy meeting chaired by new governor Michele Bullock. The Australian dollar also suffered heavy losses â€” it's down 1.1% to 63.6 US cents (near its weakest levels since November last year). That's after the US dollar jumped to an 11-month high. And that's because of a sell-off in the bond market, which has led to the US government's borrowing costs jumping to its highest level since October 2007 (around the time of the Global Financial Crisis). In particular, the US 10-year government yield climbed as high as 4.72%. (That's the return you'll get from lending your money to Uncle Sam for a decade â€” similar to a term deposit). Spot gold has also dropped 1.1% to $US1,827 an ounce, its lowest level in almost seven months. (Gold tends to do poorly when the US dollar rises). On oil markets, Brent crude futures plunged 1.8% to a three-week low of $US90.56 a barrel, as traders took advantage of a recent surge and cashed out. European stock markets also did poorly, with the Stoxx 600 index down 1%. Meanwhile, Wall Street fared better than everything else, with the Dow Jones down 0.2%, while the S & P 500 was flat, and the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.7%. This promises to be a very interesting day on markets. Stay tuned!",
