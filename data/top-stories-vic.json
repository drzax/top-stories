Hey David, it's a fair question — and it certainly seems like an unusual thing for markets to get excited about, but let's break it down (and spoiler, it very likely won't impact the dollar). Apple is a technology mega caps (aka one of the largest tech companies), and has a market capitalisation of $US2.79 trillion ($4.35 trillion). The reason the new iPhone is getting hype in the market is because releasing a new product, or updating an existing one, is all about technological innovation — and Apple is in the unique position of being considered a market leader when it comes to smartphones. (If you need proof, look at the change mobile phones have gone through since the first-ever iPhone was launched in 2007.) So naturally, whenever Apple releases a new product that's seen as a big technological advance, investors are eager to see what the company has planned. This launch however comes at an interesting time, with Apple battling an industry-wide slowdown in demand for smartphones (which has led to a decline in sales), plus China restricting the use of iPhones in government agencies — and the market is very interested to see how that all affects Apple. But that's not to say that a new Apple device *always* sends its stocks booming. Earlier this year when the company released its virtual reality headset, Vision Pro, Apple's stocks went from hitting an all-time high during trade, before closing lower for the day after it failed to get investors excited. So, what will happen this time around when Apple unveils the iPhone 15 later this week? We're just going to have to wait and see. (Personally, I'm still getting on with my old' faithful Apple XS Max from 2019 — but if you're in the market for an upgrade, this new release might be right up your street.)",

The ASA says the Qantas board needs to provide answers to five major questions in relation to the ACCC investigation over ghost flights and the final payout owed to ex-CEO Alan Joyce. Those questions are: Was the Board appropriately oversighting organisational performance including risks? When did the Board become aware of the ACCC investigation and the prospective fine? What CEO pay decisions were made while this information was available to the Board? Did the CEO contract include the ability for clawback or malus if he breached legal obligations? Was the incoming CEO aware of the issues before starting in her new role? How will the new CEO ensure the right culture is in place to drive organisational performance, meet consumer expectations and lift staff morale? An email from ASA's CEO Rachel Waterhouse says the company clearly \" needs to restore trust in its brand with consumers, staff, and investors by providing operational excellence and ensuring strong customer service\". Mr Joyce's remuneration details are expected to be released in the Qantas annual report, which is due for release by the end of the month .",
