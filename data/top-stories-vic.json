The RBA is scheduled to give out its interest rate decision, with expectations that it will hold its key interest rate steady at 4.10 per cent on Tuesday but hike it to a peak of 4.35 per cent next quarter, a Reuters poll of economists shows. Separately, data in the US on Friday showed the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, excluding the volatile food and energy components, increased 3.9 per cent on an annual basis for August. The Federal Reserve tracks the PCE price indexes for its 2 per cent inflation target. Back home, financials descended 0.1 per cent with two of the \"big four\" banks trading in negative territory. A slump in oil prices took energy stocks lower by 0.7 per cent. Sector major Woodside Energy and Santos toppled over 0.1 per cent. On the other hand, gold stocks and technology stocks gained 0.8 per cent and 0.2 per cent, respectively. Export-reliant miners also rose 0.6 per cent, with behemoths BHP and Rio Tinto trading in the positive territory. Among individual stocks, Liontown Resources gained 0.7 per cent after Hancock Prospecting increased its stake to 12.4 per cent in the company.",
