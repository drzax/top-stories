The proud Larrakia man from Darwin is the co-founder of Something Wild Australia, an Indigenous owned company that supplies native ingredients like magpie goose, green ants, Kakadu plums and bush apples to restaurants and supermarkets across the nation. Motlop was emotional when he accepted the Innovation Award : \"That is a bit overwhelming. I didn't think I'd be standing here 10 years out of football and accepting an award for food ,\" he says. \"I'd like to thank the NAIDOC committee ... You run a business and obviously try to make profit and make money, and try to be better for your family. \"You don't want to just be seen as an Indigenous business, so I tried to really elevate that and become a mainstream business in what we do, whether it be a green ant in bush apple gin — things that are native to Australia — we put them in a commercial product so people can try them and take them and make them the norm .\"",
