Johnston was arrested on charges including civil disorder, which is a felony. The FBI says video footage shows Johnston pushing against police and helping rioters who attacked officers, by guarding an entrance to the Capitol in a tunnel on the Lower West Terrace. While the mob attacked police in the tunnel with pepper spray and other weapons, Johnston is said to have helped other rioters near the tunnel pour water on their faces and then joined in pushing against the line of officers. Three associates of Johnston identified him as a riot suspect from photos the FBI which had been published online. The FBI says one of the associates provided investigators with a text message in which Johnston acknowledged being at the Capitol on January 6.",

Geosciences Australia says the 4.3 magnitude quake hit at about a 10:15pm last night, about 125 kilometres off the coast. It has received reports from people feeling the quake in Cairns, Innisfail and Babinda. Sue Richards from Atherton says she'd just got into bed when her windows rattled. \"I thought it must be a bit of wind,\" Richards says. \"Then I thought it was earth-moving equipment but I now know what it was.\" Millaa Millaa resident Wilma tells ABC Local Radio she felt her home west of Cairns shake. \"I felt the ground shaking,\" she says. \"I live on the highway and there were no trucks going past at the time.\"",
