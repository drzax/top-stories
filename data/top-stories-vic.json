Australian Electoral Commissioner Tom Rogers told the ABC’s Afternoon Briefings that the figure was partly a reflection of the fact that there are more enrolled voters than ever before. \"We're nudging up towards about a third of the electorate [who] have already cast a vote or applied for a vote,\" he told the ABC's Greg Jennett. \"I just checked a couple of minutes ago — 3.3 million Australians have already had a pre-poll vote. About 2.1 million Australians have applied for a postal vote, many of those are now on their way.\" Rogers said the AEC's mobile teams had collected about 100,000 votes, including in remote communities, and that 20,000 votes had been cast overseas, including 7,000 at the High Commission in London.",

There was a lot of concern, and, frankly, fake news about what the consequences of it would be. There would be all these negative consequences. None of them were realised. \"We know that it was an uplifting moment, particularly, I think, for young Australians at that time. Every school in the whole country stopped to hear the apology. \"Brendan Nelson gave a fine speech as Liberal leader. It is unfortunate that Peter Dutton walked out on that speech. He found the consequences he was talking about, though, weren't realised. He has apologised for that but is committing exactly the same actions in being negative, saying No on this.\"",
