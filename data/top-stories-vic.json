The events of May 24, 2020, triggered a Senate inquiry, forced three Rio Tinto executives to resign including former chief executive Jean Sebastian-Jacques, and saw Western Australia update its cultural heritage law. In the wake of the incident, the Federal Government will draft new national heritage laws to increase protections for Indigenous sacred sites and review native title legislation. Rio Tinto is working with the Juukan Gorge traditional owners, the Puutu Kunti Kurrama people (PKKP) to rehabilitate the site. But traditional owner Burchell Hayes says that will never make up for the destruction. \"The destruction of our most significant cultural heritage site should not have happened, and to ensure that we will never experience this senseless feeling of loss and devastation in the future, we are driven towards achieving a co-management process of country with mining companies.\" \"We have already started to see minor aspects of the co-management model working at Juukan Gorge, though rehabilitation works of some of the surrounding areas.\" “Overall, we are pleased with the rehabilitation and remediation works that have since occurred  through the committee’s instructions and directions, but in saying this, nothing will make up for the  destruction at Juukan Gorge.\" Here's more on the fallout from the destruction of the Juukan Gorge caves from my colleagues in the ABC's Indigenous Reporting Team.",
