The union has rejected the federal government's revised pay offer of 11.2% over three years, saying it doesn't match cost-of-living pressures. \"There are very real cost-of-living pressures on workers right across the economy, and the public sector is no different, \" said CPSU national secretary Melissa Donnelly. \"The Albanese Labor government can and should do better on pay for its own workforce.\" Ms Donnelly said she expects the strike will impact services like Centrelink. \"It is unfortunately likely to have some impact on services across the Services Australia network ,\" she said. \"Be it customers contacting the smart centres, that is the call centres, or people attending in face in service centres.\" Services Australia is encouraging those who need to access their services and can't delay while the strike is taking place to use self-service: For more about the Services Australia strike, you can read the below analysis from the ABC's Markus Mannheim — he's taken a look at employment data and to try and assess just how much public servants are actually worth.",
