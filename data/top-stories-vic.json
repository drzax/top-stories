Colonel Jonathan Conricus, IDF's international spokesperson, confirmed they were behind a deadly air strike, which they claim has killed a top Hamas commander. \"There was no strike on a refugee camp,\" he told ABC's Patricia Karvelas. \"We targeted a Hamas battalion commander, a very important combatant who was leading combat operations against us. \"He was hiding together with many of his terrorists, his combatants in a tunnel complex underneath civilian houses, underneath the street.\" Earlier, we reported that an IDF statement said the strike on Jabalia, Gaza's largest refugee camp, had killed Ibrahim Biari. Hamas spokesperson Hazem Qassem has denied any senior commander was there and called the claim an Israeli pretext for killing civilians. \"I can confirm that he has been killed, and so have many terrorists. That was the aim of what we have done,\" Colonel Conricus told the ABC. \"I understand that there are reports of civilian casualties. I want to emphasise the civilians are not our targets – we focus on Hamas. \"And it is because of Hamas practices of using women and children and civilians as their human shields that there are casualties.\" The Hamas-run health ministry and a hospital director say at least 50 civilians were also killed. UN Special Rapporteur for the Palestinian Territories, Francesca Albanese, responded directly to the claim, saying the Israeli strike on Jabalia could constitute a crime against humanity. \"A refugee camp inhabited by 400 cannot be a legitimate military target, and this cannot be justified. If it is it might be an extermination, which constituted a crime against humanity under international law,\" she told RN Breakfast. Follow the link below to listen to the interview:",

Emergency crews were called to fires in grassland near Waltham Court, Bonogin Road and Brighton Lane between 2:45pm and 4:10pm yesterday. Initial investigations indicate the fires were deliberately lit. Anyone who was in the area or who has dashcam footage, is urged to contact police. The federal Emergency Services Minister Murray Watt says arsonists are putting people in danger. \"It is so unfortunate that every fire season we see absolute nongs going around deliberately lighting fires that put other people at risk, of course if these people are caught they will be charged.\"",
