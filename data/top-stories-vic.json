America is also bolstering its military presence in the broader region to deter other enemies of Israel from trying to widen the war. \"We moved the US carrier fleet to the eastern Mediterranean and we are sending more fighter jets to that region and made it clear to the Iranians — be careful,\" he said. Earlier, White House national security spokesman John Kirby said there was no evidence linking Iran directly to Saturday's attack. But he said security agencies would \"continue to look at the intelligence stream and see if it leads us to different conclusions\".",

Talkback callers asked how a potential federal Voice would interact with SA's own Voice to Parliament. Mr Malinauskas, in the Yes camp, said the two are \"completely separate propositions\". \"If there's a Yes outcome on the weekend, the state-based Voice and the federally-based Voice will be unique,\" he said. \"That is in many respects no different to countless other organisations that the parliament and government have set up to provide on any number of decisions.\" Mr Speirs, a No campaigner, was also asked by callers if he were to win the next election, would the Liberals change the state Voice. \"I've been very clear publicly that we would watch the state-based Voice as it unfolded and would be open to amending it or changing the way it worked, if it wasn't working effectively,\" he said. \"We'll have to see the outcome in South Australia on Saturday evening or Sunday when those results become apparent as to whether a No vote in South Australia can be read as a lack of support for the premier's legislated state-based voice.\"",

Senator Thorpe told ABC Radio National Breakfast that the prime minister's comments on the weekend he would abandon the Voice proposal if Australians vote it down was \"weak\". \"It's a weak response, it's like, 'I throw my bat and run away, I don't want to play no more,' attitude,\" she said. The independent senator said she was opposed to the Voice being used as \"window dressing\" for Indigenous recognition in the constitution, which she views as insufficient to address Australia's colonial history. But Senator Thorpe said there should still be a Voice to Parliament, saying she would support legislation if it was not tied to the constitution.",
