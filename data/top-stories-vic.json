He says councils weren't treated as partners and Geelong made official complaints about the pressure being applied and lack of time they were given to make high-level decisions. He says these included a two-day deadline for the council to provide input on the Games planning. \"That was the standard that was set going forward for communication for the state government and the City of Greater Geelong,\" he says. He says Geelong's concerns went unanswered and were proved to be founded when, weeks later, the Games were cancelled. He says he received a phone call from the government 10 minutes before the premier's press conference to announce the cancellation of the games. \"It was a blow and it still is a blow to me,\" Cr Sullivan says.

Senator Henderson points to a figure in the business case referring to $205 million to $215 million to be provided by the federal government. YATES: That was an assumption that was directly given to us (by the Department of Jobs, Precincts and Regions). HENDERSON: Did the assumption have any basis of fact? YATES: Well, you'd have to ask the department what was the basis of its information … HENDERSON: Well hang on a minute … you're the one preparing the business case, don't you scrutinise the assumptions to be given? Do you ask the question 'was this a committed amount' or 'on what basis are we assuming that we will receive $205 million as a worst case and $215 million as a best case from the federal government?' YATES: That assumption was an assumption that was given to us. HENDERSON: You just take that at face value? You don't query it, you don't question it, you don't say well what's the basis for it? WALKER: We can't answer that question because to do so we might reveal information that's part of cabinet in-confidence. HENDERSON: Oh that's just rubbish! … That is just an absolute cop out.

The biggest increases were in department store, clothing & footwear and cafes & restaurants. \"The rise in July is a partial reversal of last month's sharp decline in turnover. This was after weaker-than-usual end of financial year sales,\" ABS head of retail statistics Ben Dorber said. \"While there was a rise in July, underlying growth in retail turnover remained subdued. \"Cafes, restaurants and takeaway food services turnover grew considerably, despite an overall slowing down in food-related spending in recent months. \"The rise in July was boosted by additional spending at catering and takeaway food outlets linked to the 2023 FIFA Women's World Cup and school holidays.\" These figures also don't factor any change in prices.
