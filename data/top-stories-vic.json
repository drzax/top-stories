He says the diving community is small and that he had known French diver Paul-Henri Nargeolet for 25 years. \"For him to die tragically in this way is almost impossible for me to process.\" Cameron has completed 33 deep sea dives to the historic wreck, saying he's \"spent more time on the ship than the captain did.\" \"I also designed and built a sub to go to the deepest place in the ocean, three times deeper than the Titanic, so I understand the engineering and safety problems associated with building this type of vehicle,\" he adds.",
