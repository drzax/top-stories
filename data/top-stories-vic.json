At the end of Question Time, Peter Dutton told federal parliament Mr Albanese should be visiting Israel's leadership in Tel Aviv too, as a show of support in the ongoing Israel-Gaza war. He said it should take precedence above any other commitments. \"It would be in our country's best interest to go via Tel Aviv, and provide support to the Israeli leadership,\" he said. \"It is important for us to be able to stand with Israel at this time, as other world leaders have done. \"That should be the priority of any international travel at the moment, as we seek to be part of an alliance to keep the pressure down on those who seek to have a wider conflict in the region.\" President Biden visited Israel overnight, closely following a visit from German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, while UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak will visit soon.",
