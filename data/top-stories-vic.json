I'd really like to see the prime minister lean in on that.\" The Arrernte/Luritja woman from Central Australia, told ABC News that the next steps forward need to ensure Aboriginal people have agency in conversations and solutions made about them in an attempt to close the gap. \"The path we went down ahead of referendum clearly isn't going to be the one we walk together but we do need to sort this out, we do need to keep moving because the issues that brought us to the referendum exist with us today, those stats relating to closing the gap still exist and they need a different solution and [that needs] to be a solution that's defined by Aboriginal people who know what is happening with the underlying drivers who know how to solve that,\" she said. She said it was important these \"challenging\" conversations were had in a way that do not damage vulnerable children. \"I think that's about having kind conversations, that's about looking for hope, that's about looking for what comes next and charting that pathway,\" she said about protecting children post-referendum. \"Being honest and being really aware what you say in public and how you say it is heard by our children. \"And even when you look back at election night, children were watching, children were watching that result and they were watching how people responded.\"",

Geelong want more than the offered pick 24 Lachie Schultz to Collingwood. Pies have offered Freo pick 19, but the Dockers are looking at their future first round pick instead Liam Henry to St Kilda. Saints don't want to cough up pick 13 or pick 21 Brandon Zerk-Thatcher to Port Adelaide and Xavier Duursma to Essendon. Is a straight swap in the offing? Shane McAdam to Melbourne. Dees are offering a future second, Crows have been trying (and failing) to get a move for Harrison Petty going with it Jack Gunston to Hawthorn. Hawks have been clear this isn't their priority, but could still be done later in the week Mabior Chol to Hawthorn, Jacob Koschitzke to Richmond. Every chance these end up linked with the Suns getting involved in a three-way trade Paddy Dow to St Kilda, Nick Coffield to Western Bulldog s.

Shares slumped 13% on opening day and it's kept going from there. IFR News called it: \"One of the worst starts for a major US IPO and almost certainly the death knell for hopes of a significant rebound in new issues in the final three months of the year.\" (As in, 'Who on earth would be dumb enough to float a company between now and Christmas after this debacle?'). Shares dropped another 6.6% to US$37.55 in their second session on Thursday. \"A punchy valuation, poor timing, buyside skittishness and a vain effort to create scarcity in the stock marred the sandal-maker's NYSE offering, forcing sponsor L Catterton to accept a price in the lower half of the marketing range\". Who to blame? Private equity's system of buying something and then trying to sell it for way more is chief among the issues. Private equity firm L Catterton pitched Birkenstock as being worth US$10 billion. But that's more than twice what the private equity firm paid for the company in April 2021. The market now has the company valued at US$6.8 billion.",

The incoming boss of PwC Australia was criticised for bringing Ms Walsh, because she was so new in the role and couldn't answer questions about the historic allegations the committee is investigating - and the 'now and future' problems they've created. Asked about her status in the firm, she responded: \"I have been with the firm for three years and I've been in my current role as chief people officer since July.\" And today, she's gone! Ms Walsh will become Chief People Officer at Qantas, a press release has announced. \"In this new role, Ms Walsh will help drive a stronger relationship between Qantas and its 25,000 employees, as well as with the unions that represent them. This function will also help lead the recruitment of thousands of new roles across the Group in coming years as it takes delivery of new aircraft and returns to growth.\" The airline has a bit of work to do in the 'HR space'... it fought it's own employees all the way to the appeals court of the High Court, losing all the way, after it sacked 1700 of them illegally. As was reported at the time: Qantas maintained it made the decision for sound commercial reasons after its business plummeted by more than 90 per cent. But the Transport Workers' Union (TWU) told the High Court the airline had also been motivated to head off industrial action when things returned to normal. The union said the sackings were in breach of the Fair Work Act, which prohibited actions that interfered with a worker's rights. Ms Walsh will start in January 2024.",
