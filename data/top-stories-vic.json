Ben Dorber, ABS head of retail statistics, says the modest increase in retail spending shows consumers \"continued to restrain their retail spending\" last month. In fact, in trend terms, retail turnover rose 0.1 per cent, and was up only 1.3 per cent compared to August 2022 — the smallest trend growth over 12 months in the history of the series. \"Considering how high inflation and strong population growth has added to retail turnover in the past year, the historically low trend growth highlights just how much consumers have pulled back in response to cost-of-living pressures,\" he said. Clothing, footwear and personal accessory retailing (+1.3 per cent) recorded the largest rise, followed by cafes, restaurants and takeaway food services (+0.7 per cent), other retailing (+0.7 per cent), and department stores (+0.4 per cent). Spending was again boosted by the 2023 FIFA Women's World Cup with strong demand for fan gear and increased spending across cafes, restaurants and takeaway food outlets as large crowds attended matches and live sites across the country.",
