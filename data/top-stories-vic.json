The warehouse, located in the small town of Romano di Lombardia near Bergamo, contained a total of 25,000 wheels of Grana Padano.",

If you were following the news last week, you'd know Trump was indicted on conspiracy charges related to efforts to overturn the 2020 election result. After last week's court appearance, Trump posted on his Truth Social platform: \"IF YOU GO AFTER ME, I'M COMING AFTER YOU!\" That threatening post prompted prosecutors to respond with a late-night court application to have the former president prevented from going too far with his social posts. In particular, prosecutors raised concerns Trump could publicly reveal confidential material that they will need to give his legal team as part of the court process. They asked the court to issue a \"protective order\" that would restrict any sharing of that material to a select group of people with a direct stake in the case. A short time ago, Trump's legal team formally responded to the prosecution's request, asking the court to narrow the proposed order \"to shield only genuinely sensitive materials from public view\". It says the prosecutors' request represents an attempt by the government to limit Trump's First Amendment free speech rights. \"Worse, it does this against this administration's primary political opponent, during an election season in which the administration, prominent party members, and media allies have campaigned on the indictment,\" the response lodged with the court says. The court is yet to decide on the application.",
