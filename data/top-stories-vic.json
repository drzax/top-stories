Our North America bureau chief, Jade Macmillan told News Breakfast residents allege that the company failed to shut off powerlines, despite warnings that strong winds could bring them down and spark fast moving fires. Here's what she told the show: Hawaiian Electric says that the cause of these fires still hasn't been determined, and that it will work with state and local officials as they investigate. But its share price has plummeted today amid these new questions in the aftermath of this tragedy. There is so much pain on Maui, but there's also growing frustration. People asking, for example, what caused these fires? People also still wondering — why residents in the worst affected areas weren't warned of the dangers sooner? Why the emergency sirens, for example, in particular areas, didn't go off? People also frustrated in some areas about the level of Government assistance that is being provided. They are reporting a really remarkable effort by locals, by volunteers who are doing whatever they can to help one another out. She reported specialist teams with cadavar dogs are still making their way through what is left of Lahaina and the death toll is still expected to rise.",

In a joint statement, Dutton and Ruston say the Coalition will instead commit $250 million in funding over four years for community sporting infrastructure, if re-elected. \"The prime minister's proposal of a one-off public holiday to celebrate the incredible success of the Matildas comes at a potential cost to the economy of $2 billion; not to mention sidelining the recent triumphs of other female teams in the Netball World Cup and the Ashes. It is a stunt which will have no legacy impact,\" they say. \"The prime minister has tried to make the Matildas' success all about him. But we think there is a better way. We are opposed to Mr Albanese's public holiday and today we are announcing a policy that will instead make a lasting difference to the community and the lives of our young people. \"This is a better and more lasting proposal than the Prime Minister's public holiday ego trip. It will mean better outcomes over the decades ahead for millions of young girls and boys across the country.\" Dutton and Ruston say the Liberal Party's investment wouldn't be contingent on state or territory government investment, but they would be encouraged \"to match our investment to bring the total to $500 million\". They say they are committed to the proposal, even if the Matildas don't win the World Cup.",

It has reported a 3.3% decline in net profit after tax to $254.5 million on a 2.2% fall in sales revenue. However, its earnings before tax, interest and material one-offs climbed 11.4% to $583.5 million, with underlying net profit (excluding those one-offs) rising 16.6% to $376.1 million. The company says its strategy of \"premiumisation\" is working to improve profit margins on the wine it is selling, with its margin jumping 2.9 percentage points to 24.1%. It is targeting a margin of around 25%. TWE said demand for its luxury and premium wines remains solid, especially its flagship Penfolds brand, which saw both sales and profits rise more than 14%. The company says it expects demand for its luxury wines to continue being strong, while premium wine demand is expected to remain \"consistent\". However, \"commercial\" wine demand is expected to \"remain challenged\" with TWE predicting further volume decreases for the mass market segment. The company has declared a final dividend of 17 cents per share, which leaves the full-year payout for shareholders at 35 cents per share.",
