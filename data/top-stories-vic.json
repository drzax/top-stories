But since the start of 2023, virtually all opinion polls have shown a steady decline in support. It's clear that backers of change are starting this sprint to the finish on the back foot. Rather than careening from poll to poll, we're keeping an eye on all the polls together, using a mathematical model that averages the polls into a single trendline. This is not a prediction of the outcome of the referendum, just our best effort at understanding what the polls are collectively saying! According to that model, the Yes case has, on average, 45.3 per cent support. If the referendum were held today, the polls would have to be out by significantly more than they were in the 2019 election for Yes to come out ahead nationally. Just note that our uncertainty interval is really quite wide at the moment (between 41.8 per cent and 49 per cent). That's partly because there haven't been any national polls published in more than a fortnight! It doesn't mean this referendum is done and dusted already. Today is clearly a big reset for both sides. And it seems that groups like Yes23 have been building up a significant campaign fund for a push in the final weeks. But things have clearly been trending in the direction of No. A significant number of people have flipped from Yes to No this year. The big question is: Can the Yes campaign make the most of this campaign period and flip enough of them back to their side? Oh, and one more thing. Winning the national vote is just one of the conditions for the referendum to pass. A majority of states need to vote yes too, and it is entirely possible for at least three states to vote no while the nation votes yes.",
