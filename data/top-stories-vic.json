Figures from the AEC reveal almost 98 per cent of eligible Australians have registered to vote in the Indigenous Voice to Parliament referendum next month. A Voice to Parliament would act as an independent advisory body for First Nations people. Australian Electoral Commissioner, Tom Rogers, says the registration figures are a great result. \"It's criticial that all Australians have their chance to have their say,\" he says. \"Youth enrolment is at the highest rate its ever been for an electoral event and the same for estimated indigenous enrolment so it's a great outcome for all Australians and it means that it will be a solid event and a solid outcome.\" Rogers says the referendum vote is a huge logistical event. \"We'll be visiting well over 750 remote communities. I think last week we dispatched 160,000 ballot papers to our overseas missions - the largest in-person overseas vote that we've seen. \"Big postal process is underway. I think as of yesterday we've had something like about 1.2 million applications for postal votes.\"",

Festival organisers say they hope the \"period of renewal\" will set it up for a \"full return\" in 2025. Dark Mofo's new artistic director Chris Twite made the announcement on Hobart's waterfront this morning. He says two staples of the festival — the Winter Fest and Nude Solstice Swim — will still go ahead next year, but without the rest of the festival, after reaching an agreement with the state government. Next year was to be Twite's first Dark Mofo, after long-time artistic director Leigh Carmichael stepped down from the role following this year's festival. \"Whilst it's a tough decision, it allows us the time to ensure we have a festival for another decade of darkness,\" Twite said. \"It allows us to face, head-on, rising costs and changing conditions to ensure that future for a full return in 2025, and to lay the foundation for the festival for another decade.\"",

It's the last Commonwealth budget surplus since Peter Costello’s 2007-08 budget and the last Labor government surplus since Paul Keating in 1989-90. That dramatic improvement is a result of strong commodity prices, and higher than expected income and company tax revenue, but the government says the surplus is also down to responsible economic management. Federal Treasurer Jim Chalmers says the government \"delivered this surplus at the same time as providing billions of dollars in cost-of-living relief and making vital investments in the long-term growth of our economy\".
