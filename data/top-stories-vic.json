Disaster chaplains and community support are made available to residents and a space has been set up for people who want to pay their respects or need assistance. Williams says the island, which is home to about 3,500 people, is a very small and tight-knit community. \"Everybody knows everybody and, at the same time, they're all there to make sure that they support each other,\" she says. \"I just think they are still reeling at this whole event. It's so tragic.\"",

The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that 187,000 jobs were added to the US economy in July. That might sound like a lot, but it's pretty small in a country with around 335 million people. Combined with a downwardly revised jobs gain in June, which was even smaller, it is the weakest jobs growth in two and a half years. Economists were generally expecting around 200,000 jobs to be created. Despite the fall in jobs, unemployment fell from 3.6 to 3.5% and wages growth continued at an annual pace of 4.4% â down from recent peaks around 5%, but above expectations. \"US Treasuries [bond prices] rallied immediately following the non-farm payroll headlines, from 4.20% to 4.10% in the first 90 minutes, and to below 4.05% during the afternoon to end the week at 4.034%, a fall of just 8bps on the week,\" wrote NAB's Ray Attrill. \"The 2yr [yield] slumped from 4.945% quickly down to 4.80% with falls extended to 4.764% by the close to be 12bps down on the week. Pricing for a further 25bps Fed rate hike in September reduced from 17% to 13% .\" However, Westpac's Imre Speizer said the data was not a major shock to the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee (which sets US central bank interest rates). \"FOMC member Goolsbee said the jobs report was 'pretty much what we expected', the labour market cooling a little but still 'extremely strong'. He was not concerned about the sticky wage data, stressing wages are a backward looking indicator,\" Speizer observed.",
