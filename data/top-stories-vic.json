Federal Transport Ministe r Catherine King denied a request from the Gulf state carrier to double its 28 weekly services to Australia, amid Qantas opposition. The airline's chief executive, Akbar Al Baker, broke his silence on Saturday, telling CNN he was \"very surprised\" the rights were blocked. \" We found it to be very unfair, our legitimate request to be not granted, especially at a time when we were so supportive of Australia ,\" he said. Some had praised Qatar for maintaining flights into and out of Australia during the pandemic, even when domestic carriers stopped flying. \"[We were] repatriating stranded citizens from around the world to and out of Australia, helping them receiving medical supplies and spare parts, et cetera, during the COVID period when the national carrier and their partners completely stopped operating in Australia,\" Mr Al Baker said. \"We were there for the people of Australia.\" You can continue reading this story below:",

Brent crude prices are up 0.3% to $US94.23 a barrel, while West Texas Intermediate crude is around $US90.78 a barrel. \"China's stimulus policy, resilient US economic data, and OPEC+'s ongoing output cuts are the bullish factors that support the oil market's upside movement,\" CMC Markets analyst Tina Teng said, referring to a reserve ratio cut by China's central bank last week to boost liquidity and support its economy. Brent and WTI have climbed for three consecutive weeks to touch their highest levels since November after Saudi Arabia and Russia extended supply cuts to the end of the year as part of the OPEC+ group's plans and as Chinese refineries ramped up output, driven by strong export margins. Both contracts are also on track for their biggest quarterly increase since Russia's invasion of Ukraine in the first quarter of 2022. \"Production cuts, led by Saudi Arabia, stabilised the market in July but are now likely to push the market into a 2 million bpd (barrels per day) deficit in Q4 ,\" ANZ analysts said in a note. Global oil demand growth, on the other hand, is on track to hit 2.1 million bpd, they added, in line with forecasts from the International Energy Agency and the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). \"The subsequent drawdown in inventories in Q4 leaves the market exposed to further price spikes in 2024 ,\" ANZ said. — with Reuters",
