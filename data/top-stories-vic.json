Hamas has spent years expanding its extensive underground warren of tunnels so that a second city thrives underneath the Gaza Strip. The stuffy, narrow passages can run low on oxygen, and at their deepest, the tunnels reach 70 metres below the Earth's surface. It's believed this is where Hamas leadership, fighters, headquarters, communication, weapons, and supplies like water, food and ammunition are hidden. More than 200 hostages kidnapped on October 7 are also trapped somewhere in this labyrinth, hoping for rescue. Dr Daphné Richemond-Barak, an expert on underground warfare who teaches at Reichman University in Israel, has been inside these tunnels from the Israel side (once they'd been cleared by the Israel Defense Forces of course). This is what she said it feels like to be down there: \"When you go into these tunnels, they seem completely endless, and you don't even see the arteries on the side. \"You might see a segment that comes on the right or an artery on the left, but once you're in it, it all looks very, very dark. And literally, you have no idea what is at the end of the tunnel. \"It's claustrophobic and it's narrow, and you lose your sense of direction immediately. You lose complete sense of time. \" Dr Richemond-Barak said she imagines the hostages are being held in one of the larger rooms built into the tunnel network: \"Maybe there is some level of electricity, maybe they are being told what time it is, and what day it is. But if you don't have this information, you would lose track very quickly. \"They are humid and suffocating and they are incredibly scary. So when you walk in them, you'd be disoriented for sure, but also incredibly afraid. \"There's no way to determine in which direction you're walking. Have you crossed the border? Are you in a different country? The hostages are likely to feel exactly the same kind of feelings. The tunnels, they elicit this really kind of existential fear and you don't know how deep you are.\"",

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office played down the report compiled by the Intelligence Ministry as a hypothetical exercise — a \"concept paper\". The document is dated October 13 and was first published by Sicha Mekomit, a local news site. In its report, the Intelligence Ministry — a junior ministry that conducts research but does not set policy — offered three alternatives \"to effect a significant change in the civilian reality in the Gaza Strip in light of the Hamas crimes that led to the Sword of Iron war\". The document's authors deem this alternative to be the most desirable for Israel's security. The document proposes moving Gaza's civilian population to tent cities in northern Sinai, then building permanent cities and an undefined humanitarian corridor. A security zone would be established inside Israel to block the displaced Palestinians from entering. The report did not say what would become of Gaza once its population is cleared out. AP",
