              "plaintext": "Overnight Australian families were reunited with loved ones, after the second repatriation flight out of Israel touched down in Sydney. Elderly grandmother Shosh Edelshtein says she came to visit her grandsons, and \"run away from the bombs\". \"Here is quiet,\" she told a reporter at Sydney airport. While she resides in the north of Israel, away from the border near Gaza, she said it was still \"not quiet\" where she had been living. \"People love to fight,\" she says, agreeing that she had fled a scary situation. Schlomo Diveroni, along with many others who had been repatriated back to Australia from Israel, expressed immense gratitude for the Australian government. \"It's exceptional what they did,\" he told a reporter at Sydney airport. From the free and expedited flight, courtesy buses, accommodation and food, Mr Schlomo says he appreciated being safe and well after the family tragedy he left behind in Israel. A family member had been \"murdered\" in the fighting, he says, while three of his daughters chose to remain behind. \"They are on razor's edge constantly under threat, missiles coming through, you have to run to shelters, it's a precarious situation over there.\"",

Brent crude is currently trading at around $US90.92 a barrel, and has seen even higher prices in recent days in response to the war between Israel and Hamas. Mr Chalmers says initial oil price shocks will be part of the inflation picture, but it won't encompass the full impact of the war. \"We are already seeing global oil prices come up in recent months, and the conflict in the Middle East risks making that worse,\" he said. \"[RBA] governor Michele Bullock made a very similar point yesterday. \"The inflation numbers that we see next week, which predate the escalation of the conflict in the Middle East, we think will capture some of those early impacts of the elevated global oil price as a consequence of the way that supply was ramped back, even before we've seen the developments in Israel and on the Gaza Strip in recent days.\"",

You see it in the hours worked, participation has come off a bit, but still near record highs, and we also know that job ads have been a bit weaker as well. \"So we're seeing some of that softening as a consequence of the combined economic challenges from around the world, and here at home. \"We know that the interest rate rises, which are already in the system, are biting consumption hard in particular. \"We know that retail turnover has been soft, and we know that people are under pressure.\"",

Brody Viney, a senior economist at NAB, says it is their expectation that there will be one more rate hike before the end of the year. \"Most likely at the November meeting, after that [quarterly] inflation figure we get next week,\" he told News Channel. He said NAB is expecting a \"strong print\" in the inflation data for the trim mean and headline rates, and that would put pressure on the RBA to raise rates at its November meeting. \"For the RBA, they are still looking at a very high inflation rate and a very tight labour market as we've seen today,\" he said. \"For them, it's really a matter of can they be confident they've done enough to bring inflation back down to target in the way they're currently expecting? \"We think [next week's inflation figures] will likely challenge their forecast around the rate of improvement in inflation. \"We know they've stated in the recent minutes from the October meeting that they have a very low tolerance for inflation not coming down as fast as they're expecting. \"If we do get that upside surprise on inflation next week that we're expecting, we think that should be enough to push them to do one more rate rise .\"",
