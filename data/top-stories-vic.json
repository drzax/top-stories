As we reported earlier, seven United Nations special rapporteurs have warned that Palestinian people in Gaza are facing a “grave risk of genocide”. \"We are worried as well, but the question should be directed at Hamas, not at us,\" Lapid said on ABC News Breakfast. \"We didn't initiate this, we didn't want this war. \"We are protecting our own people against a murderous terrorist organisation that is killing the innocent and we have no other choice. \"Yes, I think the people of Gaza are in peril, the same as the people of Israel, we are all being threatened and killed by a terror organisation.\" The Hamas-run Palestinian health ministry estimates 9,061 people, including 3,760 children, have been killed in Gaza. Lapid said as Israel was fighting Hamas in a densely populated area there was \"going to be casualities\". \"Of course we are sorry,\" he said. \"We have no fight with babies, we have no fight with civilians. We are doing our best to avoid hurting the civilians, this is exactly the difference between a terror organisation and a law-abiding democratic country. \"I am acknowledging the fact that the innocent are suffering and I am urging you to direct your questions about it to Hamas.\" The United Nations human rights office said on Wednesday that it was concerned that Israeli air strikes on Gaza's Jabalia refugee camp could amount to war crimes. When asked if Israel was heeding international concerns about the growing civilian death toll in Gaza, Lapid said \"yes\". \"But I am not sure we need this because we are concerned to begin with,\" he said. \"This is not something we want to do. \"This is not a war we wanted to be engaged in, this was forced upon us. Part of the problem we have going into this war is that we want to do our best to avoid hurting the civilians. \"Right now both Israelis and the people of Gaza are victims of Hamas.\" Watch the full interview from ABC News Breakfast below:",

To catch you up, Hezbollah is a militant Shia Muslim group and a major political party based in Lebanon. Like Hamas in Gaza, the group is backed by Iran, but it's way bigger, better trained, and more powerful. Hezbollah has been firing rockets across Lebanon's shared border with Israel, raising fears here that it could escalate into war with a far more formidable opponent. So with Nasrallah due to speak at 3pm Friday Jerusalem time (midnight Saturday AEDT), some people in the Middle East are nervous about what he's going to announce. Eyal Hulata, Israel's former national security advisor, says he's not expecting a declaration of war. \"I have no intel but … I think he will use this opportunity to say he was always right, Israel is fragile, like a spiderweb, look how easy it was for Hamas to infiltrate,\" he said. \"But I don't expect him to announce that he's going to escalate … I might be wrong, he does hold the keys to real escalation of the situation. If he decides to act differently, this can still inflame into a regional conflict.\"",

The surgeon has a very successful practice in the UK. But when he saw the news, he immediately booked his flights and began his journey towards Gaza. The British-Palestinian doctor knew the attack would likely lead to a ground incursion of the coastal enclave. Fearing a crisis would befall Gaza's hospitals, he wanted to be there to treat patients with critical conditions. \"I studied in London but did my internship during the conflict in Lebanon in 1996,\" he told the ABC. \"I have a long experience of working in conflict zones — Iraq, Syria, Lebanon and Gaza.\" He says the health system in the region is falling apart, with patients sleeping in corridors. He also says conditions in the hospitals in Gaza are so bad he's resorted to using vinegar as disinfectant.",
