Police allege the man hit another man on the head with a frying pan about 2:40pm on Monday at Fellows Oval. The man then allegedly stabbed a female student multiple times before chasing and stabbing a second female student. Police allege the man then approached a second male student and punched him in the face. The two 20-year-old female students were taken to hospital, where one remains in a serious but stable condition, and the other in a stable condition. The two male victims did not need hospital treatment. The 24-year-old man was taken into custody and charged with attempted murder, two counts of assault and one count of possessing an object to be used to kill. Police said no motive for the incident had been identified and they did not believe the victims knew the accused. You can read more about this story below:",

That's after weeks of controversy over anti-Semitic content on X. \"I hope you find within the confines of the First Amendment, the ability to not only stop anti-Semitism ... but any collective hatred of a people,\" Mr Netanyahu said. \"I know you're committed to that … but I encourage and urge you to find a balance.\" Earlier this month, Mr Musk attacked the Anti-Defamation League, a non governmental organisation which fights anti-Semitism, extremism, and bigotry, for causing a 60 per cent decrease in US advertising revenue at X, without providing evidence. Mr Musk previously joined a conversation on X with the hashtag #BantheADL, and engaged with users who express white supremacist views like Keith Woods. He also asked followers whether he should poll the platform about banning the ADL. Mr Woods is a white nationalist from Ireland who has previously called himself a “raging anti-Semite” in a since-deleted tweet. Mr Musk told Mr Netanyahu during the roundtable that he was against anti-Semitism and against anything that \"promotes hate and conflict \", repeating his previous statements that X would not promote hate speech. Researchers have found an increase in hate speech and anti-Semitic content on the platform since Mr Musk took over. Here's more from Reuters.",
