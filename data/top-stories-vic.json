The government's current plan is to invest in clean energy projects through what's known as \"Rewiring the Nation\" at a cost of $20 billion. But the Opposition has argued nuclear is cheaper and more reliable. Energy Minister Chris Bowen says new analysis shows introducing nuclear power to replace retiring coal-fired power stations would cost $387 billion. \"The opposition is proposing small modular reactors, which are 300 mega watts each which means you need a lot of them to replace the retiring coal fired power,\" he said. \"In fact, you need 71 of these reactors to r eplace 21 gigawatts of coal fire power we have in the system. \"Its a unicorn and a fantasy.\"",

The $50 million settlement sum is in line with what CBA announced on November 14 last year. The CCI class action related to consumer credit insurance for credit cards and personal loans sold between January 1, 2010 and March 7, 2018. According to Slater and Gordon, which was behind the class action, claimed CBA: caused customers to make payments as a result of a mis,taken belief their policy was compulsory or provided value to them engaged in misleading or deceptive conduct in relation to the sale of the policies to customers, engaged in unconscionable conduct in relation to the sale and issue of the policies to customers by, among other things, selling or issuing policies with no or little value, unlawfully provided personal advice to some customers who purchased the policies in a bank branch or over the telephone.",

She's officially taken over from Philip Lowe, who left the central bank at the end of last week after a seven-year term as governor himself, on top of decades spent working there in various roles. As for how the RBA will see its new dawn, it'll be a pretty muted affair. We're still two weeks away from the RBA's next meeting on interest rates (October 3, if you haven't got it in the diary). But the RBA will release the minutes from its most recent meeting earlier this month, when the central bank barely shifted the dial from its monetary policy stance in its August meeting. As for who is set to replace Michele Bullock as deputy governor ? There's no word yet, although the search is thought to be continuing.",

Just like an election, all Australian citizens aged 18 and over must vote in a referendum. Since the announcement of the Voice referendum, the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) says there have been more than 270,000 enrolment transactions. The AEC says this referendum \"will have the most complete roll of any national election or referendum in history\". \"If you’ve turned 18, become an Australian citizen or moved house since the 2022 federal election then don’t forget to take action,\" the AEC says. The vote will be held less than a month from now on October 14 .",

Kim reportedly spent two days in the city, visiting a university, an aquarium and an animal food plant, among other facilities. It wrapped up his unusually lengthy, week-long trip to Russia, during which he pledged to step up military and economic cooperation with President Vladimir Putin. The visit will serve as \"an opportunity to further solidify the traditional bond of good-neighbourhood cooperation between the two countries, which are rooted in comradely friendship and military unity, and to open a new chapter in the development of relations\", KCNA said. The rare summit between Kim and Putin has prompted the United States and South Korea to warn against any weapons trade.
