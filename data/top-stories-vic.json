Anthony Albanese announced yesterday that he would visit Beijing in November, the first Australian prime minister to do so since Malcolm Turnbull in 2016. Earlier this week, Scott Morrison warned the government's \"keenness\" to restore relations with China would be interpreted in Beijing as Australia being \"concessional and acquiescent\". Peter Dutton told RN Breakfast it's appropriate for the prime minister to go to China. \"It's appropriate for the prime minister to go because he's got an invitation and he's also got a list of issue to raise,\" Dutton said. \"He obviously believes he can get some way in relation to the relief around the tariffs which have been imposed, human rights issues obviously.\"",
