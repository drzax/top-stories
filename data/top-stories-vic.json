              "plaintext": "Deputy Prime Minister Richard Marles spoke to RN Breakfast host Patricia Karvelas this morning and called the comments left on some news sites about Stan Grant \"revolting\". Here's their exchange: PK: Stan Grant is stepping away from journalism, hopefully temporarily, due to the relentless racist attacks he’s faced. Yesterday the ABC News Director Justin Stevens said these attacks were fuelled by what he described as a \"relentless campaign\" from News Corporation. Have you seen the relentless campaign from News Corporation? RM : Well, without commenting on that specifically, what I would say in relation to Stan Grant's decision is firstly, Stan Grant is a wonderful Australian who has made a huge contribution to our public debate but also to our broadcasting landscape. I think it is of enormous heartache to me and almost every Australian that Stan Grant finds that this is the place that he's at. We all wish Stan well. I hope it's a temporary decision on his part. To see someone of his calibre, to see someone taking the steps he has, has got to give us all pause for thought about the public debate and the environment in which we live today in Australia. PK: Have you ever read the comments on those stories from The Australian? RM: To be honest I try not to read those comments, partly that's because when you read some you can see how loathsome they are. PK: Should those newspapers be dealing with the consequences and the commentary? I've read some of them I've read some of them about myself, too. They're revolting. RM: Look, I mean, they are revolting. It's an area in an age of social media where there are comments that are posted, well – anyone who engages in social media, I think we all need to do much better. The answer to the question about why I haven't read all them is precisely because of the impact which one has when you do read them all. You know, I do find it very troubling, is the short answer to the question. And I think this is a moment in Stan Grant's decision for us all to have a long think about it.",

Earlier this month a jury in New York found Trump sexually abused Carroll and then defamed her by calling her a liar, but did not rape her. The jury awarded Carroll about $US5 million ($7.4 million) in compensatory and punitive damages. Carroll's lawyers have pointed to Trump's posts on Truth Social calling the verdict a \"disgrace\", and his criticism of Carroll on CNN on May 10 in arguing that she should be allowed to amend her earlier lawsuit. The lawsuit alleges Trump defamed her by denying the incident in 2019, while he was president. \"Trump's defamatory statements post-verdict show the depth of his malice toward Carroll since it is hard to imagine defamatory conduct that could possibly be more motivated by hatred, ill will or spite,\" Carroll's lawyers say. \"This conduct supports a very substantial punitive damages award.\" Carroll's proposed amended complaint seeks at least $US10 million ($15 million) in compensatory damages against Trump, plus punitive damages. Trump has already launched an appeal to the jury's findings.",

The US economy is at risk of crashing if no deal is reached in 10 days. The Democratic president and the top congressional Republican have struggled to make progress on an agreement, as McCarthy is pressuring the White House to agree to spending cuts in the federal budget that Biden has called \"extreme\". They have until June 1 to increase the government's self-borrowing limit or trigger an unprecedented debt default that economists warn could bring on a recession. Biden told reporters as the meeting started that he was \"optimistic\" they could make some progress. Both sides need a bipartisan agreement to \"sell it\" to their constituencies, he said, adding there may still be some disagreements. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen on Monday offered a sobering reminder of how little time is left, saying the earliest estimated default date remains June 1 and that it is \"highly likely\" that Treasury will no longer be able to pay all government obligations by early June if the debt ceiling is not raised. White House aides met with Republican negotiators on Capitol Hill for two hours on Monday, and early indications were that the talks had gone well. \"I firmly believe what we're negotiating right now, a majority of Republicans will see that it is a right place to put us on the right path,\" McCarthy told reporters. Any deal to raise the limit must pass both chambers of Congress, and therefore hinges on bipartisan support. McCarthy's Republicans control the House 222-213, while Biden's Democrats hold the Senate 51-49. A failure to lift the debt ceiling would trigger a default that would shake financial markets and drive interest rates higher on everything from car payments to credit cards.",
