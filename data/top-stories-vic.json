It is supported by every patient group I can think of and every doctor's group.\" Butler says he does not agree with the coalition that it's been rushed. \"I've read the motion that the Coalition is moving this morning and it doesn't seek to delay it by six months. The motion is to disallow the measure and it would go altogether,\" he says. He says he doesn't believe it will negatively impact the pharmacy sector. \"I said first of all we would reinvest every single dollar the Commonwealth saves from this measure which is about $1.2 billion, every single dollar back into the pharmacy sector and we would talk to pharmacies and crossbenchers and others about the best way to invest that money.\"",

The move, which could see 6 million Australians able to collect two months' worth of medicine for the price of one, is set to take effect from September 1. Health Minister Mark Butler says it's one of the government's key cost-of-living measures. He said many Australians were having to make difficult choices between paying their rent, mortgages, putting food on the table and considering when they could afford the medication they need. The Pharmacy Guild, is heavily against the move with concerns it could mean community pharmacies go under. The Coalition says the government hasn't properly consulted the sector on the proposal. The opposition is set to move a disallowance motion in the Senate today, trying to use the upper house to block the proposal from occurring. This will happen unless the government agrees to renegotiate a funding agreement with the community pharmacy sector. ABC Political reporter Matt Doran told News Breakfast the debate would come down to the cross bench, after the Greens took Labor's side. This is the final day that such a parliamentary manoeuvre can be used before parliament breaks for three weeks.",
