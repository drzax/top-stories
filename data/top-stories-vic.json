Los Angeles Superior Court Judge David Herrifor handed down the sentence to the 31-year-old who was convicted on three felonies in December. Herriford said it was “difficult to reconcile” the kind, charitable person and good father many people described Lanez as being during the sentencing hearing with the person who fired the gun at Megan. “Sometimes good people do bad things,” he said. “Actions have consequences, and there are no winners in this case.” Megan Thee Stallion said Lanez fired the gun at the back of her feet and shouted for her to dance as she walked away from an SUV in which they had been riding in July 2020, after leaving a pool party at Kylie Jenner’s Hollywood Hills home. She had to have surgery to remove bullet fragments. “Since I was viciously shot by the defendant, I have not experienced a single day of peace,” Megan said in a statement read by a prosecutor on Monday. “Slowly but surely, I’m healing and coming back, but I will never be the same.” Lanez asked the judge for mercy before his sentencing. “If I could turn back the series of events that night and change them I would,\" he said. “The victim was my friend, the victim is someone I still care for to this day. “Everything I did wrong that night, I take full responsibility for.”",

Perry was diagnosed with cancer in 2016, and his wife confirmed his death in a statement. \"Casper was a fun-loving, giving person,\" she says. \"He was a genuine, family oriented man. He loved Chicago with all his heart. He will be greatly missed.\" His Cha-Cha Slide continues to be a favorite at weddings, clubs and many other events about two decades after it became popular. Participants typically dance in lines and rows, following commands to a funky beat on when and where to step, stomp, hop and slide. In a May interview, he said that the Cha-Cha Slide initially was an aerobic exercise for his nephew who worked at a fitness club. It would go on to become popular in many countries. \"From there, it just took off,\" he said. \"I have one of the biggest songs that's played at all stadiums: hockey, basketball, football, baseball, they played it at the Olympics. \"It was something that everybody could do.\"",

              "plaintext": "A record cash profit reported by the Commonwealth Bank this morning — let's have a look behind the headline result at some of the interesting insights. CBA has access to the financial data of millions of Australians, and as we've reported previously, it shows the uneven impact of rising interest rates on different households : As you can see in the charts above, households between 25 and 54 years old hold the greatest portion of CBA home loan debt, whereas those over 55, and particularly the over 65-year-old bracket, have the biggest chunk in deposits. Looking at the middle chart, the change in savings over the year tells a similar story — older Australians are saving more, while the youngest age brackets, from 18 to 34, are saving less than a year ago. And finally, spending (right-hand-side chart) — unsurprisingly, it follows a similar trend. With inflation pushing prices higher, all age brackets have been spending more than they were a year ago over the past three months, simply because stuff costs more. However, over the past four weeks, 18 to 34-year-olds have pulled back and are actually spending less — which means they are cutting back quite significantly on purchasing, given prices are still up compared top a year ago. In contrast, those 55+ have actually increased spending further over the past few weeks. You can find out more on this trend here: The result also provides an insight into how many people are falling behind on their home loans : Less than half a per cent of borrowers are behind on their home loan by more than 90 days, which is when things start to get serious. But there has been a small uptick in the percentage of borrowers behind by more than 30 days — still under 1 per cent but edging higher as the impact of higher rates continues to flow through. And there's more impact to come, with CBA estimating around a third of the impact of cash rate changes is yet to be felt by households.",

It was driven by improved margins, a significant turnaround in investment returns, and strong top-line growth across the group's Insurance Australia and banking arm for the year ended June 30. Net gain from yields and investment markets was $724 million (a big improvement over the $190 million loss in the previous year). Last week, the $4.9 billion sale of Suncorp's banking arm to ANZ was blocked by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. Suncorp now expects the separation (and other costs related to the deal) to increase from $500 million to between $575 million and $600 million. The company also declared a final dividend of 27 cents per share (a significant increase over last year's 17 cents per share).",
