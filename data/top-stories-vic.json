We are yet to find anything high value enough for her to to      give up a good ball. Thanks for that query Ben! Here's Dr Karishma's take: Dr Karishma: Each and every dog has      their 'driver's'. For some dogs/breeds such as labradors - food will      forever be their motivator and they can be easily trained with      treats! And not much else will ever be closer to their hearts! For      other dog's, especially our working breed dogs such as Kelpie's and Border      Collie's, play and activity are typically their motivators. And it      probably means that they are a high energy dog that needs plenty of      exercise and thrives off that time spent with you in the park too. Playing      in the park is great exercise and also important bonding time, but to stop      them becoming ball obsessed (as sometimes they can get tunnel vision and knock anything/anyone out of the way as well as disregard commands or      even get ball aggression) there are a few substitutes to mix things up. This includes trying alternative games in the park such as Tug-Of-War,      setting a finish time and winding down her high arousal by gently rolling      the ball along the ground at the end of this time to give them a cue that      playtime is coming to an end, swimming, and encouraging alternative toys      in the absence of balls. It's not an easy one as she will likely always be      a lover of a good ball, but encouraging different forms of exercise      and play is important.",

Is this allergies? Here's Dr Karishma 's advice: Dr Karishma: It sounds that there may be 2 things going on - both anxious behaviour and an aversion to the noise of the sizzling steak or pitter patter of the gecko's. As well as allergies from chewing at his feet! Chewing and licking at paws can initially start as a contact allergy from walking on something itchy or irritant such as grass or certain plants, then turn into a behavioural displacement behavior or habit. And they use this behaviour to help calm or soothe themselves - kind of like children sucking their thumb. It's best to get his little feet checked at the vet to ensure there is not an underlying allergy for which he needs medication prior to attributing it to behavior. Sometimes a simple cream or course of tablets can rectify the itchy feet.",

That dogs can tell when women get pregnant and get protective. But is there any science behind it? This is what Dr Karishma says: Dr Karishma: Dogs are incredibly intuitive and in tune with our sounds, smells, visual cues and emotions. It is not uncommon for them to pick up on how we are feeling and alter their behaviour when they sense that we are sad, stressed, happy, angry or excited. They can display this by trying to comfort us more through nuzzling up, trying to be close to us or simply putting a paw on our lap when upset. Or barking, doing 'zoomies' and vocalising or even singing along with us when they detect we are excited. Not all dog's will pick up on scent changes, but certainly we have been training dog's for some time to assist us with detection of drugs, weapons and more recently even in healthcare to detect onset of epileptic fits or changes in blood sugar levels. So no doubt they have the capability of detecting alterations in some of our hormones.",

OPEC+ (which groups the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and allies led by Russia) has already been cutting supply to boost prices since November last year due to weaker Chinese demand and rising US supply. Despite that, it has failed to move oil prices outside a range of $US70 - $US80 a barrel. Saudi Arabia said it would extend its voluntary oil output cut of 1 million barrels per day (bpd) for another month to include August, adding that the cut could be extended beyond that month. Shortly after the Saudi announcement, Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak said Moscow would cut its oil exports by 500,000 barrels per day in August. The cuts amount to 1.5% of global supply and bring the total pledged by OPEC+ to 5.16 million bpd. OPEC+, which pumps around 40% of the world's crude oil, already has in place cuts of 3.66 million bpd. This amounts to 3.6% of global demand (including 2 million bpd agreed last year and voluntary cuts of 1.66 million bpd agreed in April and extended to December 2024). Brent crude futures were up 0.4% to $US75 a barrel.",

However, the gains were limited by looming uncertainty on whether the Reserve Bank will further lift interest rates today. By 12:05pm AEST, the ASX 200 index was flat at 7,251 points, close to its highest level in two weeks. The RBA is widely expected to hike interest rates by 25 basis points to 4.35%, though a Reuters poll of economists highlighted a divided outlook. While the latest monthly measure of consumer prices showed inflation slowed to 5.6% in May (from 6.8% in April), it was still well above the RBA's 2 - 3% target range, suggesting more monetary tightening may be required. Shares of Costa Group jumped 12.2% after the horticulture firm said it had received a $1.4 billion takeover proposal from US private equity firm Paine Schwartz Partners LLC for shares it does not already own. General insurer Suncorp slipped 0.9%. This was after it forecast a 12% jump in costs associated with catastrophe reinsurance premiums and natural hazards in the 2024 fiscal year.",
