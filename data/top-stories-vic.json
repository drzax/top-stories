From November 9, businesses will be prohibited from proposing, using, or relying on unfair contract terms in standard form contracts with consumers and small businesses, under changes to the Australian Consumer Law. The changes mean businesses and individuals could face \"substantial\" penalties by the courts, instead of just having courts declare specific terms of a contract unfair and void. The ACCC's deputy chair Mick Keogh says the changes should motivate businesses to correct their contracts before the new penalties are enforced. \"There was previously little motivation for businesses to comply with the law, despite the ACCC's compliance and enforcement actions. We s trongly urge businesses to review their contracts now to ensure they comply ,\" he said. \"The test for whether a contract term is unfair has not changed. However, businesses now could potentially face substantial penalties for contravening the law. This will better protect consumers and small businesses who have limited bargaining power, expertise, and ability to negotiate or assess standard form contracts. \"While some of the changes won't apply to contracts until they are renewed, or a new contract is entered into, businesses should be proactive in reviewing their standard form contracts now .\"",

On Friday, they warned some market players not to hype up prices for the steelmaking ingredient in response to another price rally, and its state planner also pledged to step up its regulatory oversight of the market. China is the world's biggest producer of steel, and buys about two-thirds of global seaborne iron ore. \"Iron ore edged lower as Beijing targets market exuberance,\" ANZ commodity strategists said in a note. \"Regulators told futures companies in a recent meeting to not deliberately exaggerate the atmosphere of iron ore price rallies and to analyse the market objectively.\" China's iron ore imports in August climbed 13.8% from July, fuelled by growing demand from steel mills ramping up production ahead of peak construction months. Their excitement was also bolstered by Beijing's policy support for the domestic economy amid a stalling recovery. However, the outlook for iron ore demand beyond China's traditional September-October peak season is clouded by likely steel production cuts intended to curb carbon emissions. — with Reuters.",
