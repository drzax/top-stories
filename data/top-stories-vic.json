Communications regulator the Australian Communications and Media Authority says the bank sent more than 65 million unlawful marketing emails between November 2021 and November 2022. Around 61 million of the emails unlawfully required customers to log-in to unsubscribe. ACMA also accepted a three year court enforceable undertaking from CBA which requires the bank to improve its practices and carry out an independent review of its e-marketing. ACMA chair Nerida O'Loughlin says it's important that companies make it easy to unsubscribe from marketing materials. \"The scale and duration of the breaches by the CBA is alarming, especially when the ACMA gave it early warnings it might have some issues and the steps it took were ineffective,\" she said. \"The failure to fix the issues shows a complete disregard for the spam rules and the rights of customers.\" \"We sending a strong message that the ACMA will continue to look very closely at the telemarketing practices of large businesses and we will hold them account against the spam rules where we find non compliance.\" The Commonwealth Bank says the vast majority of the breaches occurred when it updated its electronic banking customer terms and conditions in November 2021. “We acknowledge and accept the findings of ACMA’s investigation into CBA’s compliance with certain provisions of the Spam Act,\" said CBA head of marketing and corporate affairs, Monique Macleod. \"We apologise to all customers impacted by these issues which should not have occurred.\" \"We’ve fixed the problem and are making changes to ensure it doesn’t happen in the future.\"",
