Up to $30 million will be spent on accelerating mining projects in the area over the next 5 years. Up to $20 million, which will be matched dollar-for-dollar by Glencore, will be spent on an 'economic structural adjustment' package for Mount Isa. The Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk says North West Queensland will remain at the heart of the state's mining future. \"Our number one priority is to protect jobs and retain skilled workers in this important region. I understand many workers and their families will find Glencore's decision a difficult one to accept. But we will always do what we can to support workers and their families to find new good, secure jobs,\" she said.

At least 1,200 employees will be affected. Australian Workers' Union Queensland secretary Stacey Schinnerl says it's a sad day for the entire Mount Isa community. \"Now is the time for the government to cut through the green tape and fast-track approvals for new mines in the region to provide a suitable transition for affected workers. We are calling on Glencore to provide redeployment opportunities to local workers who will be affected by these closures,\" she said. In a statement, Glencore's chief operating officer, Sam Strohmayr says studies revealed the remaining mineral resources were not economically viable due to low ore grades, a lack of safe extraction areas and ageing infrastructure. \"The reality of mining is that mines have a beginning, middle and end. And unfortunately after 60 years of operation, Mount Isa's underground copper operations have now reached that end.\" He says the focus over the next few months will be providing support to employees, contractors, suppliers and the Mount Isa community. \"It's too early to put a figure on how many people may receive redundancies until we work through a process of speaking to each worker and discuss options around retention, redeployment, and retaining. Redundancies are the last resort and will be offered only when other options have been exhausted.\" The company says its other metal assets, including the copper smelter, George Fisher mine, zinc-lead concentrator and lead smelter, will all continue operating in Mount Isa.",

The energy, healthcare and basic materials sectors are up, while the utilities and technology sectors are leading the losses. The big shock today has been Credit Corp Group's massive meltdown after it announced a write-down on its US ledger assets. It's currently d own -31% to $11.89. AMP shares touched a two-month low today, after it flagged lower growth expectations for the rest of the year. High interest rates are hurting the wealth manager's earnings.
