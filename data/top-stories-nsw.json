HIA Senior Economist Tom Devitt said new home sales remain at \"depressed levels.\" \"This indicates that the slowdown in home building that is underway will continue for at least the next year,\" Mr Devitt said. “The most significant contraction in sales is in New South Wales where customers are more sensitive to rises in the cash rate. “Cancellations also remain elevated at a rate of 25 per cent in the last quarter. This means, for every four new projects a builder is recording, a previous project is being cancelled. “The RBA’s rate increases will continue to hold down new sales and cause further cancellations as finance becomes unobtainable for an increasing number of buyers. “The significant increase in the cost of land and construction across all jurisdictions over the past two years is compounding the impact of higher interest rates. \" Mr Devitt also blamed the National Construction Code which came into effect this year (which means houses need to be more energy efficient) for driving up construction costs and dampening demand. “This combination of factors will see home building continuing to contract for at least the next 12 months to its lowest level in more than a decade,” Mr Devitt said. He said sales of new homes in the three months to May 2023 compared to the same time last year are still down in most large states, led by New South Wales (-63.6 per cent), and followed by Queensland (-52.9 per cent), Victoria (-46.6 per cent) and South Australia (-29.5 per cent). Western Australia saw the only increase over the year, up by 19.4 per cent.",

The Victorian Gambling and Casino Control Commission (VGCCC) has also taken disciplinary action against Crown Melbourne.

Casino operator Crown has been fined $20 million for failing to pay enough tax. The Royal Commission into the Casino Operator and Licence found that Crown claimed tax deductions by including the costs of certain promotional activities as amounts paid out as winnings. Crown deliberately concealed the deductions from the VGCCC’s predecessor, the Victorian Commission for Gambling and Liquor Regulation. Crown has been forced to pay $61.5 million to the Victorian government for the unpaid casino tax of about $37.4 million and penalty interest of about $24.1 million. “Crown and other gaming licensees have important obligations to pay gaming taxes to the State. Not only did Crown breach its obligations by claiming tax deductions to which it was not entitled, Crown also made significant efforts at concealment,” VGCC Chairperson Fran Thorn said. \"The VGCCC will not tolerate this behaviour. We expect licensees to comply with their tax obligations and to be transparent in their dealings with us. \"We have today imposed a significant fine of $20 million on Crown to send a clear message that this type of conduct will be met with strong disciplinary action. \"This fine also sends an important message to other gambling operators about the importance of complying with their obligations to pay gambling taxes and the need for frank and open dealings with the regulator.” Crown's been fined $250 million by the VGCC.",

The findings of the liquidators mean sub-contractors and other unsecured creditors won't get the money they're owed, because most of the $147.2 million are unlikely to be recovered. \"Please note, at this stage, it appears unlikely that sufficient funds will be recovered in the liquidations to  enable a dividend to be paid to ordinary unsecured creditors,\" the report said. \"This would require all amounts owing to  secured creditors, and priority employee creditors, to be paid in full prior to any distribution to ordinary  unsecured creditors. \"Further updates regarding the progress of the liquidation and the likelihood of any  dividends will be communicated in future reports.\" Grant Thornton said customers who signed contracts at the pre-site stage of their builds might be able to claim a refund of their deposit under state warranty or compensation schemes, to mitigate losses. However, the ABC has reported Porter Davis customers who s igned tender agreements are ineligible for the Victorian government compensation scheme. However, the liquidators said the Commonwealth Bank is expected to get back most of the $33 million it's owed. \"At this stage, we anticipate the sufficient recoveries will be made in the liquidators to discharge CBA's in full,\" the report said. The liquidators' preliminary findings are that there is no compelling evidence Porter Davis companies were insolvent before February 2023. The report also noted directors could have protection from insolvency claims after February using a safe harbour defence. “Our investigations are ongoing in this regard,” the report said. Porter Davis collapsed in March, with an estimated 1,700 unfinished homes reported to be caught up in the collapse. The construction company has since made more than 400 staff redundant and has ceased work on building sites across Victoria and Queensland. The next meeting of creditors will be in Melbourne on June 28.",
