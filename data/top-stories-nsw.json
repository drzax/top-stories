Core or underlying inflation strips out volatile items like fruit, vegetables and petrol. While headline prices are coming down, core inflation came in at 6.4 per cent over the year to May according to the Bureau of Statistics. That was a tiny decline from the 6.5 per cent over the year to April. Core inflation remains high because of strong services inflation including rent and energy prices. The market is expecting one of the measures of core inflation, the Trimmed Mean CPI, to rise by 1.1 per cent over the June quarter and by 6 per cent over the year to June, which would be a pull back from the 6.6 per cent annual rate over the March quarter. National Australia Bank says that would be in line with the RBA's latest economic forecasts. However NAB's head of foreign exchange strategy Ray Attrill warns: \"We are fearful that the underlying details on services dominated by wages, rent and energy - which we expect to show no signs of moderation - could reduce the RBA's confidence in CPI falling back to the top of the target band (3 per cent) in a reasonable time frame.\" \"Hence we see the need for further RBA tightening, including next week if this is indeed the message from today's figures.\"",

The IMF slightly upgraded its global growth forecasts in its latest World Economic Outlook, but chief economist Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas says \"yet many challenges still cloud the horizon, and it is too early to celebrate\". Mr Gourinchas says the global economy continues to gradually recover from the pandemic and the signs of progress are undeniable. However, he says interest rate rises by central banks are slowing economies and core inflation remains well above central bank targets. The IMF's World Economic Outlook predicts that global inflation is expected to fall from 8.7 per cent in 2022 to 6.8 per cent in 2023 and 5.2 per cent in 2024. But it said the threat of higher inflation due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine and extreme weather could lead central banks to hike interest rates or cause world leaders to enact more restrictive economic policies. And the IMF warned that China's slow recovery following the reopening of its economy after the pandemic \"shows signs of losing steam\", and a deeper contraction in the real estate sector remained a risk. It left its forecasts for Chinese growth at 5.2 per cent this year and 4.5 per cent in 2024. with AP/Reuters",
