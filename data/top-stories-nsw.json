After signing a peace treaty 30 years ago, Jordan and Israel have had a good political relationship, however with the current escalation the government has faced pressure to not only express their solidarity with Palestinians, but to take action. The King and Queen have criticised Israel's actions in Gaza and called for an immediate cease fire and Jordan's ambassador was recalled while the Israeli ambassador was told to stay away.
