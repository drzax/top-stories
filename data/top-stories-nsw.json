Juliette Touma told Reuters in Gaza by phone from Amman that there were a total of around 19 trucks in Sunday's convoy carrying medical and food supplies. A first convoy of 20 trucks of badly needed supplies had entered Gaza on Saturday through Rafah, which had previously been out of operation after bombardments hit on the Gaza side of the border and amid wrangling over conditions for delivering aid. Distribution of those supplies began on Sunday, but aid officials are still warning of a humanitarian disaster as supplies of food, water and fuel run low. UN officials say at least 100 trucks a day would be required in Gaza to cover urgent needs. Before the outbreak of the most recent conflict, several hundred trucks had been arriving in the enclave daily. Reuters",

The benchmark indices are down around 0.8% in early trade, with the ASX 200 at 6,845 points. Mining and energy are dominating the early falls, with real estate and consumer cyclical stocks also down on fears of an economic slowdown due to higher interest rates persisting for longer. In a clearly 'risk-off' day, the sectors posting solid gains are the more 'defensive' ones of consumer non-cyclicals and healthcare — the kinds of businesses we can't avoid when we're cutting spending. Treasury Wine Estates is one of the ASX 200's top gainers, up 3% to $12.12, after the Australian Government said China is undertaking a five month review into punitive wine tariffs, with a widespread expectation they will be removed early next year. The other top rises around 10:20am AEDT were: Weebit Nano +4% to $3.91 Bellevue Gold +3.7% to $1.555 BlueScope Steel +1.8% to $18.23 ARB Corp +1.8% to $30.81 The biggest falls were for: New Hope Corporation -7.7% to $5.97 Liontown Resources -3.7% to $1.83 Champion Iron -3.5% to $6.06 Pilbara Minerals -3.5% to $3.725 South32 -3% to $3.27",

              "plaintext": "The Chinese ambassador dropped a strong hint last Wednesday, and now the Australian government is saying it is hopeful the tariffs will be gone by next year. China has told Australia it intends to take five months to review its wine tariff policy on Australian exports. Treasury Wine Estates jumped around 5% last Wednesday before giving back nearly 4% over the subsequent couple of days. Treasury was up 2.6% today to $12.07 by 10:43am AEDT. UBS analyst Shaun Cousins has reiterated his buy recommendation on the stock with a price target of $13.75 after the latest news. \"A removal of duties imposed by China on Australian wine would be a positive for TWE: (1) Existing Australian Penfolds volumes to be reallocated from other markets (as well as multi-country of origin & One by Penfolds, which are both sold into China & other markets), plus Premium Brands (e.g. Rawson's Retreat) volumes as TWE noted. (2) New TWE-owned & grower volumes to be accessed over time (3-5yr wine cycle). (3) NSR/case to be higher as a modest (less than 10%) premium price in China & stronger global demand drives scarcity, which enables further global pricing growth. (4) P/E multiple re-rating (UBSe ~2-3pts) as TWE would have access to a large luxury wine market.\" In short, the removal of tariffs will be a modest positive for TWE if it happens, even if it's taking a bit longer than the removal of barley tariffs. If China doesn't drop the tariffs at the end of the five-month review, then Australia would need to resume its case at the World Trade Organisation, which would be a negative for TWE and other wine producers as it would be a lengthy process.

This week we have two public appearances from the new RBA governor Michele Bullock, who has already spoken strongly about the need to contain inflation expectations, raising market odds of at least one more cash rate rise. The first is a speech tomorrow night at a conference hosted by the Commonwealth Bank. The second is an appearance before the Senate in Canberra on Thursday morning. That second appearance is particularly important as it comes the day after the Australian Bureau of Statistics releases its latest inflation data for both the month and quarter of September. My colleague David Taylor from The Drum has written a handy primer on why this week's Consumer Price Index release is being so closely watched by economic and interest rate forecasters.",
