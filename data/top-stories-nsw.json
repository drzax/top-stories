Priscilla, directed by Sofia Coppola and based on Priscilla Presley 's 1985 autobiography, Elvis and Me, has just premiered at the Venice Film Festival. The film, depicting Priscilla's roller-coaster life with one of the most famous figures of the 20th century, stars Cailee Spaeny in the title role and Australian actor Jacob Elordi as Elvis. At the premiere, Priscilla said the legendary rock star had been the love of her life, despite eventually leaving him. \"It wasn't that I didn't love him. He was the love of my life, but it was the lifestyle that was so difficult for me,\" Priscilla told reporters. Priscilla met Elvis in 1959 when she was just 14 and he was deeply homesick, stationed with the US army in West Germany. The film is set to be released in the US on October 27, and hopefully, Australia isn't too far behind.",
