It comes as Kim Jong Un and Vladimir Putin are expected to hold talks on the issue. Sanctions-hit Russia is reportedly eager to secure more military supplies from its ally to bolster its forces as Kyiv pushes a highly scrutinised counteroffensive to take back its territory. US President Joe Biden's national security advisor Jake Sullivan says Pyongyang and Moscow are eyeing \"leader-level discussions, perhaps even in person\" on Russia's arms needs. Sullivan says Russia could use weapons from North Korea to attack food supplies and heating infrastructure heading into winter to \"try to conquer territory that belongs to another sovereign nation\". \"This is not going to reflect well on North Korea and they will pay a price for this in the international community,\" he says. \"[It] says a lot that Russia is having to turn to a country like North Korea.\" \"We have continued to squeeze Russia's defence industrial base,\" he says, and Moscow is now \"looking to whatever source they can find\" for goods like ammunition .",

Dressed in an orange jumpsuit, the 39 year-old was in court in Washington, DC to hear the sentence, the longest handed down so far in the criminal cases resulting from January 6. Tarrio addressed the court ahead of sentencing, describing what happened on January 6 as \"national embarrassment\" and apologised to members of Congress, the police officers who defended the Capitol and the citizens of Washington, DC. The defendant pleaded with the judge to show him mercy and broke down when talking of his family, saying he had failed them. The prosecution argued Tarrio organised street violence on a national scale, bringing together the group that entered the Capitol, instructing and leading them. In handing down the sentence Judge Timothy Kelly said what happened on January 6 damaged a precious American tradition of the peaceful transfer of power and it was going to take time to fix it.",
