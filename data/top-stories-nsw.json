Hodder Watt says a lack of signage, translators and low foot traffic at some of the booths meant many community members weren't aware that voting was underway. \"It really was left up to community members and organisations on the day to make people aware,\" he said. \"There is a risk there that some people would have missed out.\"",

She joined federal Liberal colleagues at the Marden polling booth and held an impromptu press conference, saying she believes exit polls are under-representing No votes. \"There are those that are reluctant to express a public vote for No. \"Really, if we were to take people's true measure of how they actually voted, we would probably find that there were more people voting No than actually those who have come out to say publicly.\" Senator Jacinta Nampijinpa Price plans to cast her ballot in her home town next week. The Marden polling booth is in the federal electorate of Sturt and the local Liberal MP James Stevens says how people vote there will be crucial. \"If Sturt votes No, South Australia will vote No and if South Australia votes No the referendum will be defeated, so we take our responsibility here on the ground very seriously.\"",

You can find an early polling location near you using the AEC's 'Where Can I Vote?' tool. Below are the reasons why you can vote early in the Voice referendum: You are outside the electorate where you are enrolled to vote You are more than 8km from a polling place You are travelling You can't leave your workplace to vote You are seriously ill, infirm or due to give birth shortly (or are caring for someone who is) You are a patient in hospital and can't vote at the hospital You have religious beliefs that prevent you from attending a polling place You are in prison serving a sentence of less than three years or otherwise detained You are a silent elector You have a reasonable fear for your safety You can read more about whether you are eligible to vote early here.",
