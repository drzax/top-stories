Speaking at a press conference, Ms Finocchiaro says her party, the Country Liberals, is preparing policies for the 2024 NT election to help \"re-empower\" the NT's remote communities, through \"restoring community control of local government\". \"A CLP government that I lead is very committed to Aboriginal people living in the bush, in restoring, literally, their voice to our parliament,\" she said. \"Local government reform is critical, and so we're out engaging … about how we can reshape local government to give back that decision-making and that voice in our remote communities.\" At a Yes campaign on Wednesday in Alice Springs, Chief Minister Natasha Fyles criticised Ms Finocchiaro's council plan, and said she was \"simply making excuses\" for voting against a Voice.",

He was told to go home and change clothes if he wanted to cast his ballot. \"We were just going around peacefully, doing our business to vote,\" Mr Brown said. In a statement, a spokesperson encouraged voters to not wear campaign clothing, as the law states people cannot campaign within 6 metres of a polling station. \"If a voter simply wears campaign material (ie a pin or shirt) into the polling place, casts their vote and leaves, it likely won't contravene the act,\" the AEC spokesperson said. \"However, if the voter wears that material into a polling place and is then seen talking with someone inside about it … that could be construed as campaigning.\"",

While friends had been kidnapped or killed, he was lucky to escape with his life. \"I found a large tree with a bush attached to it, I went under it and started digging myself a hole. I thought 'what can I do to conceal myself … as best as I could', and after about two hours that I was in the hole, I heard the sound of leaves and twigs cracking under someone's boot,\" he said. '\"I told myself 'Omri don't move, breathe as little as you can', just hope he doesn’t see you and after a long 60 second silence I heard the sound of him approaching me and the sounds of twigs moving. \"I was closing my eyes and I thanked everyone for the incredible life I had and I hoped that my mum and my family will be able to live a happy and fulfilling life without me.\" Fortunately, he wasn’t found. It wasn't until around five hours later that he emerged from his hiding spot once the shooting stopped and managed to find police back at the festival site. \"I saw horrific stuff, I've seen cars burned, bodies burned, people that were shot at … the scene was horrific,\" he said. \"It was not a battlefield … it was a bunch of innocent people that came to a party to have fun and celebrate life and were attacked by people who came to celebrate death.\"",

Speaking to ABC's Michael Rowland from Tel Aviv, Mark Regev said Saturday's attack was a declaration of war. \"The way they invaded, they butchered our people, killing innocent people in their homes, murdering children, what they did was a strategic attack on my country and they started this war and we will finish it,\" he said. Mr Ragev said while civilian casualties should be avoided at any cost, there was no way of avoiding it in this case. \"There hasn't been a war in recent history which hasn't involved collateral damage and civilians, unfortunately, getting killed,\" he said. \"If we can't hit them back, why would they stop?\" He added that Israel authorities were urging the civilian population of Gaza to move away from Hamas strongholds. \"They aren't our target, it is the Hamas military leadership and political structure,\" he said. \"That is the target. It is going to be a war and wars are messy and we will lose people ourselves.\" He said the sort of barbarism that was committed by Hamas on Saturday morning was \"reminiscent of ISIS-type terrorism\". \"We can no longer have our civilian population exposed to the sorts of barbarism violence that Hamas is capable of,\" he said.",

London-based hedge fund Bell Rock Capital Management this morning has launched a campaign to thwart Whitehaven Coal from purchasing the two Queensland operations for a reputed $US5 billion. It will attempt to mobilise shareholders to protest the purchase by voting against the executive pay deals up before the Whitehaven annual meeting in a fortnight. BHP has been steadily reducing its coal exposure with a view to a complete exit and in recent months has been in negotiations with Whitehaven to purchase the Daunia and Blackwater mines in central Queensland. Both mines are jointly owned by BHP and Mitsubishi and have been on the market since February. The London-based investor has kicked off the campaign this morning with letters to all Whitehaven shareholders and an advertising blitz in major newspapers. Bell Rock, which owns close to 5 per cent of Whitehaven, is incensed that a key hurdle for executive bonuses has been removed from this year’s AGM agenda which it claims will encourage Whitehaven executives to pursue growth via acquisitions at the expense of shareholder returns. The proposed mine purchases are likely to cost Whitehaven almost as much as the company is worth and will need to be funded by a massive increase in debt. While the Daunia mine produces metallurgical coal for steelmaking, a large portion of Blackwater’s output is thermal coal, the demand for which is declining as efforts to battle climate change escalate.",
