The first Australian assisted flight is scheduled to depart from Tel Aviv to London in the coming hours, carrying 220 passengers. Global affairs editor John Lyons has just spoken on News Channel about the plans forAustralians who want to get out and return home. \"I'm here at Ben-Gurion Airport in Tel Aviv, where in a few hours time 220 Australians are going to turn up for the first of the assisted flights out of Israel,\" he said. \"These flights are operated by Qantas and are free to Australian citizens who want to flee this war zone. But those people lucky enough to get on these flights are certainly more fortunate than the 1 million or so people who live in Gaza City. \"The Israeli army has given them 24 hours to evacuate, to move to the south of the Gaza Strip in a clear sign that a ground invasion is imminent. For the elderly, the frail, the disabled, those unable to leave quickly, they could be facing the full wrath of the most powerful army in the Middle East.\"",
