              "plaintext": "US President Joe Biden said on Wednesday that Washington would provide Israel with everything it needed to defend itself as it wages war against the Palestinian militant group Hamas. Biden, who landed in Israel and met Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu early on Wednesday, said Hamas was worse than Islamic State for its killings of Israeli civilians in a surprise attack on October 7 which sparked the latest Israel-Palestinian violence. Biden said he was \"saddened and outraged\" by an explosion at a hospital in the Gaza Strip on Tuesday which Hamas said killed hundreds of people, but added that it seemed the \"other team\" was responsible, in reference to Palestinian militants. \"Based on what I've seen, it appears as though it was done by the other team, not you,\" Biden told Netanyahu during a meeting. But the US president said there were \"a lot of people out there\" who weren't sure what caused the blast. Biden said 31 Americans were among the more than 1,300 Israelis killed in Hamas's October 7 attack. \"Americans are grieving, they really are,\" Biden said. Biden had been scheduled to visit Jordan after the stop in Israel, but meetings there with Arab leaders were called off after the hospital explosion. Netanyahu thanked Biden for coming to Israel, telling him the visit was \"deeply, deeply moving.\" \"I know I speak for all the people of Israel when I say thank you Mr President, thank you for standing with Israel today, tomorrow and always.\" Reuters/AP",
