              "plaintext": "Iron ore futures rebounded on Tuesday after hitting nearly two-week lows in the previous session, as Beijing was seen preparing an additional sovereign debt issuance as part of efforts to spur economic growth. The steelmaking ingredient, however, was confined in tight price ranges, with its gains capped by persistent worries about a deepening crisis in China's property sector. The most-traded January iron ore on China's Dalian Commodity Exchange ended morning trade 1.1 per cent higher at 842 yuan  ($US115.31) per metric ton, after a three-session slump. On the Singapore Exchange, the benchmark November contract rose 0.9 per cent to $US113.80 per ton. China, the world's top steel producer, is set to approve slightly more than 1 trillion yuan ($US137 billion) in additional sovereign debt issuance on Tuesday as Beijing steps up its efforts to spur infrastructure spending, three sources told Reuters. \"We expect the situation in China's property market will stabilise in the latter part of the year and China's steel demand will record slight positive growth thanks to government measures,\" said Máximo Vedoya, chairman of the World Steel Association's economic committee, in the Brussels-based group's latest outlook issued on October 17. Moody's, however, warned on Tuesday that weak fundamentals would further weigh on Chinese developers' credit quality over the next 12 to 18 months. Iron ore prices are likely to fluctuate this week with a downward bias, said data and consultancy provider Mysteel, citing weak Chinese demand. \"Chinese steelmakers have experienced a continuous decline in their profitability for eleven consecutive weeks, with only 19.05% of the 247 steel mills surveyed reported being profitable,\" Mysteel said in its weekly outlook. Dalian coking coal and Dalian coke rose 2.1 per cent and 1.6 per cent, respectively. Chinese steel benchmarks rose, with rebar up by 0.2 per cent, hot-rolled coil by 0.4 per cent, wire rod by 0.4 per cent, and stainless steel by 0.6 per cent.",

The Australian Council of Trade Unions says its members, including the CFMEU, which represents Stonemasons, and the Maritime Union of Australia, will band together to prevent the product from being brought through ports or transported by union members to construction sites across the country next year. Engineered stone contains high levels of silica which can cause incurable lung disease if workers inhale dust while cutting the material. The ACTU says as many as 1 in 4 stonemasons that work with engineered stone have been diagnosed with silicosis. Federal, State and Territory Work Health and Safety Ministers will meet on Friday to discuss a report by Safe Work Australia which has investigated banning the product. A spokesperson for the Federal Workplace Relations Minister Tony Burke says the Commonwealth will be asking the meeting to agree to publicly release the report. “The Albanese Government believes no one should ever contract a terminal illness simply because they’ve turned up to work” the spokesperson added.",

Shares in the company rose to $0.33, the highest price since mid-September. Zip, Australia's biggest standalone BNPL service provider, said it returned to cash earnings before taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBTDA) profitability in the first quarter of fiscal 2024, ahead of its prior guidance for the first half. Owing to the strong performance of its domestic and New Zealand businesses and continued strength in the US total transaction volumes, Zip upgraded its forecast with an aim to touch cash EBTDA profitability for FY24 from a prior projection for the second half of fiscal 2024. \"Zip continues to expect to achieve a positive Group cash EBTDA result for 2H24 and following a particularly strong start to the year, Zip now expects to achieve a positive Group cash EBTDA result for FY24,\" CEO and Managing Director Cynthia Scott said. The company logged a total transaction volume (TTV) of $2.3 billion for the first quarter, an increase of 11 per cent over last year. Group revenue came in at $204.4 million, up 31.9 per cent from a year earlier. US bad debts continued to perform well with monthly cohort loss rates of about 1.3 per cent of TTV, below the target range of 1.5-2.0 per cent, Zip added.",
