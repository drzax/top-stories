It's in response to Shadow Indigenous Australians Minister Jacinta Nampijinpa Price telling the National Press Club yesterday that she believed Indigenous Australians were not being negatively affected by colonisation. Ms Burney says what Senator Price said was \"shocking\", \"offensive\" and \" a betrayal of many families living with the consequences of the Stolen Generations\". \"The idea that colonisation, in any country where there's been a colonisation process, doesn't have long and far-reaching effects is simply wrong,\" she says Attorney-General Mark Dreyfus told Radio National the No campaign strategy was to \"ignore the proposal that is on the ballot paper\". \"She is doing what the No campaign has done for many, many months, which is to talk about anything other than this referendum,\" he says. Federal Opposition Leader Peter Dutton was asked by Channel Nine if he agreed with her views. \"Firstly, she's a brave Indigenous woman, and we either accept that people have views, a broad range of views, or we don't,\" he said.",
