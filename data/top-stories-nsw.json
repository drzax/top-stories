There are some reports it could total up to $500 per household. One thing to watch out for is an indication from the government about how this relief will be delivered. Experts such as Nicola Willand, a researcher in housing and sustainability at RMIT University, say the most effective form of delivery will be direct payments from the government into retail energy accounts. Dr Willand also hopes any energy payment isn’t limited to those receiving pensions and Centrelink benefits, “as low-income families just above welfare may miss out”. But while bill relief may be welcome short-term help, it’s not a long-term fix to high energy prices. “It’s going to help a lot, but it’s not going to be a sustainable solution,” Dr Willand said. She believes future spending initiatives should be focused on retrofitting homes to make them more energy efficient. “Homes are not well insulated, they’re not draft-proof, heaters are not efficient. Retrofitting offers continued relief.”"

We haven't heard much about major infrastructure projects yet, but there's one big one that you've probably heard about: a new stadium in Hobart. Last weekend Prime Minister Anthony Albanese confirmed the federal government would chip in $240 million towards the $715 million fixed-roof stadium to be built at Macquarie Point, which was the final hurdle for Tasmania to get their own AFL team. I'd say we can expect a few more major infrastructure projects being funded — alas, I have not been locked up with the mountains of budget papers this afternoon so I cannot say for sure.

                  "articleBody": "By social affairs correspondent Norman Hermant and the Specialist Reporting Team’s Leonie Thorne Two hours before the budget drops, the government has come out and confirmed something we basically already knew: JobSeeker payments will be getting a boost. What we didn’t know was which job seekers would benefit and by how much exactly their payments would increase. The 5:00pm announcement has done virtually nothing to clarify that, beyond saying the JobSeeker base rate will increase. About a week ago, we started seeing reports that job seekers over 55 were set to get a boost to their weekly payments. Treasurer Jim Chalmers did not deny those reports. More recently, there have also been leaks suggesting that JobSeeker recipients under 55 could receive modest increases too — about $20 extra per week. The 5pm pre-budget announcement has not confirmed this either. Some advocates, such as Kristin O’Connell from the Antipoverty Centre, believe the later leaks came about after the government was criticised for considering limiting increases to those aged over 55. “The 20 bucks [per week] is a thought bubble,” Ms O’Connell said. “Everything they’ve done in the last week around social security is them being totally taken aback by the reaction.” Advocates also point out that even if these boosts to JobSeeker do materialise, the payment will remain well below the poverty line. Currently, the JobSeeker payment for a single person is $693 a fortnight."

                  "articleBody": "It's a reasonable question to ask — and if you're anything like me (read: an economics fanatic) you'll have heard plenty of questions being thrown around whether this year's budget is inflationary. Unfortunately it's a bit *too* complicated to answer in short, but let's unpack why you're going to be hearing this phrase and what it means. We know the budget lays out the government's spending intentions for the year (and beyond) and they are hyper-focused on providing cost of living relief because as the name suggests, it's costing us more to live, thanks to higher than average inflation and higher interest rates. The Reserve Bank is using higher interest rates to tackle inflation by deterring us from spending — because the more we spend, the more we add to inflation — but the problem is that the prices of things we need (think housing, energy, food) are also going up. That's partly due to inflation and interest rates, but it's also due to supply shocks thanks to COVID and the Ukraine war, and the price of imported goods being high thanks to the price of our Aussie dollar. Add to that a growing population and housing shortage, and you start to get a sense of how many factors the government is contending with in preparing the budget. Obviously this is a highly simplified version, but it gives us an idea of just how complicated it is. Now when you factor in government spending to keep things ticking over, and how broad a range that is, you can see why the concerns start to mount about an inflationary budget. (Bear in mind, the government also needs to *borrow* money to make all of this happen — and that money needs to be paid back at higher interest rates.) Of course, these things are necessary to keep our country going, and plenty of people argue that the cost of living measures are needed to help people survive — which is why you're hearing Treasurer Jim Chalmers say that they have been carefully considering every measure in the budget to make sure it's not going to make inflation worse. As for how they've reached that balance? We'll hear the justification in less than an hour from now — and we'll also be getting economic experts to unpack it all too."

The ABC's Patricia Karvelas dropped by the blog a little earlier with some of the things she'll be keeping an eye on: Patricia : A federal budget is a big marketing exercise for any government - a chance to make key decisions and choices that demonstrate values and priorities. Journalists are locked up to pore over papers for hours and the government attempts to spin and sell their decisions. And so as we enter Jim Chalmer’s second budget the two political narratives the government has sought to run are that it will engage in fiscal discipline — trying to rewrite the script that Labor is reckless with money — and targeted cost-of-living relief to help the country’s most desperate people. But it’s the things we don’t yet know that will fascinate me. One element will be just how targeted the support for those on welfare will be? Another is housing — it’s the number one water cooler topic in this country. How much will the government invest in tackling some of the entrenched issues. And finally, I will be studying budget paper number 2. That’s the budget paper where you find all the cuts! Finance Minister Katy Gallagher has announced $17.8 billion in “savings” that will contribute to the substantial cost-of-living package, I want to know what will be slashed. That tells a story too — about the things the new government doesn’t value. Looking for more? Patricia Karvelas will be interviewing Anthony Albanese tomorrow at 7:35am on ABC RN Patricia: At 7.35am I’ll be interviewing the Prime Minister which really is a key interview for me - and him. How does he handle some of the curly questions on how all this money being pushed out the door will impact on inflation? And what story about him and his government does he want to tell?"

A media lock-up is essentially when a group of journalists are given sensitive information early for the purpose of reporting, but they're locked in a restricted space with no internet to stop any information from leaking early. In the case of the federal budget, there are strict processes where the Treasury approves your attendance ahead of time and officials are there on the day to monitor your activity. We're given the budget papers so that when Treasurer Jim Chalmers reveals this year's budget, we can quickly report on what it means for you. They also take our phones away from us so it's also a bit of an unintentional digital detox."

The ABC's social affairs correspondent Norman Hermant joins us with more: Norman: The government confirmed tonight that rent assistance would increase, so we’re just waiting to see more details. About 1.5 million households receive the Commonwealth Rent Assistance payment. Most of those households are on pensions and benefits. It currently pays a maximum of $157 a fortnight for singles whose rent is between $140 and $350 per week. The Australian Council of Social Service (ACOSS) has recommended that payment be doubled. In a recent report, ACOSS noted 93 per cent of people renting privately were in rental stress, spending more than 30 per cent of their income on rent. If it is boosted, it could be considered a win for beleaguered renters."

They're are also going to be watching very closely tonight — they're being squeezed from all sides when it comes to inflation, rising interest rates, high energy prices, supply chain blockages and staff shortages. One major policy coming out of the budget that we already know about that's been targeted towards a million small business owners is the energy rebate, that makes up part of the government's $14.6 billion cost of living package, unveiled yesterday. That will be welcome relief for many small business owners, according to MYOB's chief employee experience officer and government policy lead Helen Lea, who says small businesses are battling a \"perfect storm\" in the wake of COVID. She's eager for the budget to contain measures that encourage digital innovation — \"because we know digital businesses are moer productive,\" she told RN Breakfast host Patricia Karvelas. As for what other measures there might be for small business owners? We'll have to wait for all to be revealed at 7:30pm. In the meantime, you can hear Ms Lea's full chat below:"

Not only are under 30s contending with the same spiralling cost of living pressures as the rest of the country, young Australians are hard hit by issues around housing. Aside from the often completely out of reach task of buying a home, getting access to rent assistance isn't as straightforward when you're living in a sharehouse — something that isn't confined to under 30's but is certainly more common. And the rising price of pretty much everything hits even harder when you've barely had a chance to establish any savings if you've made it into the workforce. The federal government says they're going to be prioritising the most vulnerable if this budget, at 7:30pm tonight under 30s get to find out whether that includes them."

Advocates hope tonight's budget will shed more light on what that \"work\" involves. The government has already announced a new growth target, which would save more than $50 billion from the NDIS over the next decade. Spending on the scheme was projected to grow about 14 per cent annually over the next decade. The new target will limit that to 8 per cent by 2026. We also know the government is planning to crack down on price-gouging NDIS providerswho overcharge people with disability. \"If you have a business model where you are mining someone's supported independent living package for your own interests … sell your business now, because it's not going to be worth much by the time we're finished with you,\" Mr Shorten told reporters a few weeks ago. The government is also allocating more than $720 million over four years to overhaul the NDIA — the agency which runs the NDIS. What we DON'T know is how the government plans to limit the NDIS's growth, and what changes participants can expect. Disability advocates were shocked and “disappointed” by the growth target, saying they were blindsided by the announcement. Many people in the disability sector are also tired of discourse around reining in the cost of the NDIS, saying it should instead be seen as an investment that has changed the lives of thousands of Australians for the better."

Tahlia: It is slated to take effect from September 20 and will see an additional 57,000 single parents able to access more than $900 per fortnight. In 2006, the Howard Coalition government changed the eligibility requirements for the payment, lowering the age limit from 16 to eight years old. The decision was grandfathered, so people already on the scheme could remain on it. The Gillard Labor government in 2012 scrapped the grandfathering, moving people with a child older than 8 but younger than 16 onto an unemployment benefit."

                  "headline": "Expected budget surplus not expected to last, economist says",
                  "articleBody": "The federal government is forecasting a small budget surplus of about $4 billion this financial year, the first in 15 years. The dramatic turnaround from the $36.9 billion deficit projected in October has been driven by high commodity prices, a strong jobs market and a boost in net migration. But Stephen Koukoulas of Market Economics says the federal budget surplus is not expected to last. Stephen: Key commodities that delivered that surging company profit tax have already started to weaken. So that's going to put a hole in future government revenue. And of course, the government is delivering on its election promises from last year. Things like the childcare payments, the increase in the Jobseeker amounts of funding."

Bailey : So that's when you're considered independent from your parents, and it's a bit weird, because when you're 18 you can drink, you can drive, you can legally be arrested, you're basically considered an adult except for Centrelink. So over 450,000 students are locked out from Youth Allowance and Austudy payments because of the age of independence."

If the government wants to halt the extinction crisis — as it said it did during the election — that needs to change. For context, Australia currently holds the crowning achievement of having more mammal extinctions than any other continent. With that in mind, here are some things we’re keeping an eye out for in tonight’s budget: Environment law reform : This was a central part of the government’s election platform, so we’re looking to see what money goes towards the promised new federal Environmental Protection Authority, and what funding there is to get the environmental laws rewritten Water policy: We’re expecting to see some money for water market reform, and also looking out for funding for a promised review of the Murray Darling Basin Plan Local waterways: Speaking of water, Labor also promised to help clean up local waterways through a new “Urban Rivers and Catchments Program”. We’re looking out for funding for that too Threatened species : Last October, Labor announced a zero extinctions target – so we might see a little bit of extra money go towards some threatened species programs Nature markets: The government also has the big “Nature Repair Market” program, which aims to entice businesses to invest in nature ( read more about the debate here ). We’re expecting to see some funding for that"

Political reporter Nour Haydar has more: Nour: Anthony Albanese went to the last election with a pledge to “make childcare cheaper” and the changes Labor promised will soon kick in. From July 2023, more than 1.2 million families will be able to access higher childcare subsidies. Under legislation that has already been passed by the parliament, families earning $80,000 or less will get 90 percent of the childcare fees subsidised. Higher subsidy rates will also apply for families earning under $530,000. The government says the changes will benefit 96 per cent of families with a child in early childhood education and care and will cost $55 billion over the next four years to 2026-27."

                  "articleBody": "In healthcare, one of the big things to watch for tonight will be Medicare. The specialist reporting team's Penny Timms is here to help sort through it all: Penny: You might remember that last year, the federal government asked a team of experts to put their heads together and come up with recommendations on how to improve access to primary care and reduce the load on hospitals. Their Strengthening Medicare report, released in February, called for a rethink of how Australia funds primary care and GPs – but did not result in any immediate announcements. At the time, medical experts criticised the report for not including enough detail. So, a lot of people in healthcare will be looking out for the Strengthening Medicare Taskforce’s suggested reforms, and detail on how they will actually happen. The government has talked a big game, and if it doesn't do much, that is likely to be a talking point. During the election, Labor promised close to $1 billion for Medicare and GPs. Of that cash, $750 million was earmarked for the Strengthening Medicare scheme. Now the healthcare sector is waiting to see how it’s spent. One other area to watch is whether this budget will include funding for the promised Centre for Disease Control (CDC), which would better prepare Australia for national health emergencies. Last year’s October “mini-budget” included $3.2 million for “preparations to establish” the CDC. The government and health advocates have already flagged such a centre would require significant additional funding."

So, you know, you'll see different measures as part of that cost of living package. But I think what it shows is that, that really has been front and center our thinking as we finalise the budget... How to provide that sensible and affordable cost of living relief against, you know, an environment of high inflation and that's been certainly a challenge as we've been making our decisions, but people will see the full details of that."

It’s expected tonight’s package will see roughly 5 million households, and 1 million businesses, receive up to $500 in relief from their power bills. The support is expected to primarily be targeted at pensioners, others on government payments and small businesses. It’s also likely that rather than being paid directly to households, the relief will come as subsidies on energy bills. But the arrangements could become quite complex, as the federal government coordinates its package with various state and territory governments, and energy retailers."

He says 5.5 million households that are receiving pensions and other government payments, as well as around a million small businesses, will be eligible. There are some reports it could total up to $500 per household. One thing to watch out for is an indication from the government about how this relief will be delivered. Experts such as Nicola Willand, a researcher in housing and sustainability at RMIT University, say the most effective form of delivery will be direct payments from the government into retail energy accounts. Dr Willand also hopes any energy payment isn’t limited to those receiving pensions and Centrelink benefits, “as low-income families just above welfare may miss out”. But while bill relief may be welcome short-term help, it’s not a long-term fix to high energy prices. “It’s going to help a lot, but it’s not going to be a sustainable solution,” Dr Willand said. She believes future spending initiatives should be focused on retrofitting homes to make them more energy efficient. “Homes are not well insulated, they’re not draft-proof, heaters are not efficient. Retrofitting offers continued relief.”",

We haven't heard much about major infrastructure projects yet, but there's one big one that you've probably heard about: a new stadium in Hobart. Last weekend Prime Minister Anthony Albanese confirmed the federal government would chip in $240 million towards the $715 million fixed-roof stadium to be built at Macquarie Point, which was the final hurdle for Tasmania to get their own AFL team. I'd say we can expect a few more major infrastructure projects being funded — alas, I have not been locked up with the mountains of budget papers this afternoon so I cannot say for sure.

What we didn’t know was which job seekers would benefit and by how much exactly their payments would increase. The 5:00pm announcement has done virtually nothing to clarify that, beyond saying the JobSeeker base rate will increase. About a week ago, we started seeing reports that job seekers over 55 were set to get a boost to their weekly payments. Treasurer Jim Chalmers did not deny those reports. More recently, there have also been leaks suggesting that JobSeeker recipients under 55 could receive modest increases too — about $20 extra per week. The 5pm pre-budget announcement has not confirmed this either. Some advocates, such as Kristin O’Connell from the Antipoverty Centre, believe the later leaks came about after the government was criticised for considering limiting increases to those aged over 55. “The 20 bucks [per week] is a thought bubble,” Ms O’Connell said. “Everything they’ve done in the last week around social security is them being totally taken aback by the reaction.” Advocates also point out that even if these boosts to JobSeeker do materialise, the payment will remain well below the poverty line. Currently, the JobSeeker payment for a single person is $693 a fortnight.",

Unfortunately it's a bit *too* complicated to answer in short, but let's unpack why you're going to be hearing this phrase and what it means. We know the budget lays out the government's spending intentions for the year (and beyond) and they are hyper-focused on providing cost of living relief because as the name suggests, it's costing us more to live, thanks to higher than average inflation and higher interest rates. The Reserve Bank is using higher interest rates to tackle inflation by deterring us from spending — because the more we spend, the more we add to inflation — but the problem is that the prices of things we need (think housing, energy, food) are also going up. That's partly due to inflation and interest rates, but it's also due to supply shocks thanks to COVID and the Ukraine war, and the price of imported goods being high thanks to the price of our Aussie dollar. Add to that a growing population and housing shortage, and you start to get a sense of how many factors the government is contending with in preparing the budget. Obviously this is a highly simplified version, but it gives us an idea of just how complicated it is. Now when you factor in government spending to keep things ticking over, and how broad a range that is, you can see why the concerns start to mount about an inflationary budget. (Bear in mind, the government also needs to *borrow* money to make all of this happen — and that money needs to be paid back at higher interest rates.) Of course, these things are necessary to keep our country going, and plenty of people argue that the cost of living measures are needed to help people survive — which is why you're hearing Treasurer Jim Chalmers say that they have been carefully considering every measure in the budget to make sure it's not going to make inflation worse. As for how they've reached that balance? We'll hear the justification in less than an hour from now — and we'll also be getting economic experts to unpack it all too.",

The ABC's Patricia Karvelas dropped by the blog a little earlier with some of the things she'll be keeping an eye on: Patricia : A federal budget is a big marketing exercise for any government - a chance to make key decisions and choices that demonstrate values and priorities. Journalists are locked up to pore over papers for hours and the government attempts to spin and sell their decisions. And so as we enter Jim Chalmer’s second budget the two political narratives the government has sought to run are that it will engage in fiscal discipline — trying to rewrite the script that Labor is reckless with money — and targeted cost-of-living relief to help the country’s most desperate people. But it’s the things we don’t yet know that will fascinate me. One element will be just how targeted the support for those on welfare will be? Another is housing — it’s the number one water cooler topic in this country. How much will the government invest in tackling some of the entrenched issues. And finally, I will be studying budget paper number 2. That’s the budget paper where you find all the cuts! Finance Minister Katy Gallagher has announced $17.8 billion in “savings” that will contribute to the substantial cost-of-living package, I want to know what will be slashed. That tells a story too — about the things the new government doesn’t value. Looking for more? Patricia Karvelas will be interviewing Anthony Albanese tomorrow at 7:35am on ABC RN Patricia: At 7.35am I’ll be interviewing the Prime Minister which really is a key interview for me - and him. How does he handle some of the curly questions on how all this money being pushed out the door will impact on inflation? And what story about him and his government does he want to tell?",

The ABC's social affairs correspondent Norman Hermant joins us with more: Norman: The government confirmed tonight that rent assistance would increase, so we’re just waiting to see more details. About 1.5 million households receive the Commonwealth Rent Assistance payment. Most of those households are on pensions and benefits. It currently pays a maximum of $157 a fortnight for singles whose rent is between $140 and $350 per week. The Australian Council of Social Service (ACOSS) has recommended that payment be doubled. In a recent report, ACOSS noted 93 per cent of people renting privately were in rental stress, spending more than 30 per cent of their income on rent. If it is boosted, it could be considered a win for beleaguered renters.",

They're are also going to be watching very closely tonight — they're being squeezed from all sides when it comes to inflation, rising interest rates, high energy prices, supply chain blockages and staff shortages. One major policy coming out of the budget that we already know about that's been targeted towards a million small business owners is the energy rebate, that makes up part of the government's $14.6 billion cost of living package, unveiled yesterday. That will be welcome relief for many small business owners, according to MYOB's chief employee experience officer and government policy lead Helen Lea, who says small businesses are battling a \"perfect storm\" in the wake of COVID. She's eager for the budget to contain measures that encourage digital innovation — \"because we know digital businesses are moer productive,\" she told RN Breakfast host Patricia Karvelas. As for what other measures there might be for small business owners? We'll have to wait for all to be revealed at 7:30pm. In the meantime, you can hear Ms Lea's full chat below:",

The ABC's political reporter Claudia Long dropped by the blog a little earlier this afternoon to help unpack it all: Claudia: The federal government has its work cut out for it if they plan to use this budget to show young people they're important to Labor. Not only are under 30s contending with the same spiralling cost of living pressures as the rest of the country, young Australians are hard hit by issues around housing. Aside from the often completely out of reach task of buying a home, getting access to rent assistance isn't as straightforward when you're living in a sharehouse — something that isn't confined to under 30's but is certainly more common. And the rising price of pretty much everything hits even harder when you've barely had a chance to establish any savings if you've made it into the workforce. The federal government says they're going to be prioritising the most vulnerable if this budget, at 7:30pm tonight under 30s get to find out whether that includes them.",

Advocates hope tonight's budget will shed more light on what that \"work\" involves. The government has already announced a new growth target, which would save more than $50 billion from the NDIS over the next decade. Spending on the scheme was projected to grow about 14 per cent annually over the next decade. The new target will limit that to 8 per cent by 2026. We also know the government is planning to crack down on price-gouging NDIS providerswho overcharge people with disability. \"If you have a business model where you are mining someone's supported independent living package for your own interests … sell your business now, because it's not going to be worth much by the time we're finished with you,\" Mr Shorten told reporters a few weeks ago. The government is also allocating more than $720 million over four years to overhaul the NDIA — the agency which runs the NDIS. What we DON'T know is how the government plans to limit the NDIS's growth, and what changes participants can expect. Disability advocates were shocked and “disappointed” by the growth target, saying they were blindsided by the announcement. Many people in the disability sector are also tired of discourse around reining in the cost of the NDIS, saying it should instead be seen as an investment that has changed the lives of thousands of Australians for the better.",

The ABC's political reporter Tahlia Roy joins us, and says the budget measure will see single parents supported until their youngest dependent turns 14. Tahlia: It is slated to take effect from September 20 and will see an additional 57,000 single parents able to access more than $900 per fortnight. In 2006, the Howard Coalition government changed the eligibility requirements for the payment, lowering the age limit from 16 to eight years old. The decision was grandfathered, so people already on the scheme could remain on it. The Gillard Labor government in 2012 scrapped the grandfathering, moving people with a child older than 8 but younger than 16 onto an unemployment benefit.",

The dramatic turnaround from the $36.9 billion deficit projected in October has been driven by high commodity prices, a strong jobs market and a boost in net migration. But Stephen Koukoulas of Market Economics says the federal budget surplus is not expected to last. Stephen: Key commodities that delivered that surging company profit tax have already started to weaken. So that's going to put a hole in future government revenue. And of course, the government is delivering on its election promises from last year. Things like the childcare payments, the increase in the Jobseeker amounts of funding.",

If the government wants to halt the extinction crisis — as it said it did during the election — that needs to change. For context, Australia currently holds the crowning achievement of having more mammal extinctions than any other continent. With that in mind, here are some things we’re keeping an eye out for in tonight’s budget: Environment law reform : This was a central part of the government’s election platform, so we’re looking to see what money goes towards the promised new federal Environmental Protection Authority, and what funding there is to get the environmental laws rewritten Water policy: We’re expecting to see some money for water market reform, and also looking out for funding for a promised review of the Murray Darling Basin Plan Local waterways: Speaking of water, Labor also promised to help clean up local waterways through a new “Urban Rivers and Catchments Program”. We’re looking out for funding for that too Threatened species : Last October, Labor announced a zero extinctions target – so we might see a little bit of extra money go towards some threatened species programs Nature markets: The government also has the big “Nature Repair Market” program, which aims to entice businesses to invest in nature ( read more about the debate here ). We’re expecting to see some funding for that",

Political reporter Nour Haydar has more: Nour: Anthony Albanese went to the last election with a pledge to “make childcare cheaper” and the changes Labor promised will soon kick in. From July 2023, more than 1.2 million families will be able to access higher childcare subsidies. Under legislation that has already been passed by the parliament, families earning $80,000 or less will get 90 percent of the childcare fees subsidised. Higher subsidy rates will also apply for families earning under $530,000. The government says the changes will benefit 96 per cent of families with a child in early childhood education and care and will cost $55 billion over the next four years to 2026-27.",

The specialist reporting team's Penny Timms is here to help sort through it all: Penny: You might remember that last year, the federal government asked a team of experts to put their heads together and come up with recommendations on how to improve access to primary care and reduce the load on hospitals. Their Strengthening Medicare report, released in February, called for a rethink of how Australia funds primary care and GPs – but did not result in any immediate announcements. At the time, medical experts criticised the report for not including enough detail. So, a lot of people in healthcare will be looking out for the Strengthening Medicare Taskforce’s suggested reforms, and detail on how they will actually happen. The government has talked a big game, and if it doesn't do much, that is likely to be a talking point. During the election, Labor promised close to $1 billion for Medicare and GPs. Of that cash, $750 million was earmarked for the Strengthening Medicare scheme. Now the healthcare sector is waiting to see how it’s spent. One other area to watch is whether this budget will include funding for the promised Centre for Disease Control (CDC), which would better prepare Australia for national health emergencies. Last year’s October “mini-budget” included $3.2 million for “preparations to establish” the CDC. The government and health advocates have already flagged such a centre would require significant additional funding.",

Speaking to ABC News Breakfast, Finance Minister Katy Gallagher said it's a \"significant package\". Kate Gallagher : Not just in the scale, but in the reach that we're trying to have with it. So, you know, you'll see different measures as part of that cost of living package. But I think what it shows is that, that really has been front and center our thinking as we finalise the budget... How to provide that sensible and affordable cost of living relief against, you know, an environment of high inflation and that's been certainly a challenge as we've been making our decisions, but people will see the full details of that.",

The ABC's political reporter Tom Lowrey joins us, and says it's likely the relief will come in the form of subsidies on energy bills, as opposed to direct payments to households: Tom: For months the federal government has been talking up energy price relief as a “centrepiece” of the budget, and tonight they will finally put some detail to the rhetoric. $1.5bn was pledged in December to help Australians push their power bills down, which would be matched by the states and territories. It’s expected tonight’s package will see roughly 5 million households, and 1 million businesses, receive up to $500 in relief from their power bills. The support is expected to primarily be targeted at pensioners, others on government payments and small businesses. It’s also likely that rather than being paid directly to households, the relief will come as subsidies on energy bills. But the arrangements could become quite complex, as the federal government coordinates its package with various state and territory governments, and energy retailers.",

              "plaintext": "By social affairs correspondent Norman Hermant Treasurer Jim Chalmers has confirmed the government will deliver energy bill relief in the budget. He says 5.5 million households that are receiving pensions and other government payments, as well as around a million small businesses, will be eligible. There are some reports it could total up to $500 per household. One thing to watch out for is an indication from the government about how this relief will be delivered. Experts such as Nicola Willand, a researcher in housing and sustainability at RMIT University, say the most effective form of delivery will be direct payments from the government into retail energy accounts. Dr Willand also hopes any energy payment isn’t limited to those receiving pensions and Centrelink benefits, “as low-income families just above welfare may miss out”. But while bill relief may be welcome short-term help, it’s not a long-term fix to high energy prices. “It’s going to help a lot, but it’s not going to be a sustainable solution,” Dr Willand said. She believes future spending initiatives should be focused on retrofitting homes to make them more energy efficient. “Homes are not well insulated, they’re not draft-proof, heaters are not efficient. Retrofitting offers continued relief.”",

What we didn’t know was which job seekers would benefit and by how much exactly their payments would increase. The 5:00pm announcement has done virtually nothing to clarify that, beyond saying the JobSeeker base rate will increase. About a week ago, we started seeing reports that job seekers over 55 were set to get a boost to their weekly payments. Treasurer Jim Chalmers did not deny those reports. More recently, there have also been leaks suggesting that JobSeeker recipients under 55 could receive modest increases too — about $20 extra per week. The 5pm pre-budget announcement has not confirmed this either. Some advocates, such as Kristin O’Connell from the Antipoverty Centre, believe the later leaks came about after the government was criticised for considering limiting increases to those aged over 55. “The 20 bucks [per week] is a thought bubble,” Ms O’Connell said. “Everything they’ve done in the last week around social security is them being totally taken aback by the reaction.” Advocates also point out that even if these boosts to JobSeeker do materialise, the payment will remain well below the poverty line. Currently, the JobSeeker payment for a single person is $693 a fortnight.",
