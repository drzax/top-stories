The complaint filed in Delaware bankruptcy court also names as defendants Caroline Ellison, who led Bankman-Fried's Alameda Research hedge fund; former FTX technology chief Zixiao \"Gary\" Wang ; and former FTX engineering director Nishad Singh. FTX said the defendants continually misappropriated funds to finance luxury condominiums, political contributions, speculative investments and other \"pet projects\", while committing \"one of the largest financial frauds in history\". The alleged fraudulent transfers occurred between February 2020 and November 2022 when FTX filed for Chapter 11 protection, and could be undone — or \"avoided\" — under the US bankruptcy code or Delaware law, FTX said. A spokesman for Bankman-Fried declined a request for comment from Reuters. Bankman-Friend has pleaded not guilty to several criminal charges, while Ellison, Wang and Singh have pleaded guilty and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors.",

CBA, Westpac and ANZ have all lifted their fixed rates in the last 10 days, and now with NAB following suit, there are no longer any fixed rates from the big four banks under 6%. Here's how today's changes from NAB affect the lowest fixed rates it offers for owner-occupiers paying principal and interest: For reference, here's the lowest advertised fixed rates with the big four banks now, per RateCity.com.au: So why the rise? Is it because of the RBA's past rate hike? Here's RateCity.com.au 's research director Sally Tindall 's take: \"Pressure on profit margins is likely to be the key motivator behind these fixed rates increases. Conveniently, a lack of interest in fixing from borrowers gives the banks the ability to hike these rates without any significant consequence,\" she said. \"These higher rates aren't washing with borrowers who are about to come off their fixed rate and looking to reassess their options. \"For the small proportion of borrowers opting to re-fix, they'd do well to look beyond the big four banks.\"",

(If you want live figures, head to the top of the blog and expand the post for a complete rundown of the main indices.) Although the ASX is lower, it's pretty muted overall for the sectors. Energy is the biggest winner so far, up 0.1%, while consumer cyclicals and utilities are down 0.1% each. The other sectors are otherwise in completely neutral ground and haven't moved at all. It's also fairly muted looking at the top and bottom movers across the market (which is to be expected, as it's still early days). The top five movers: Aurizon Holdings +0.8% Ansell +0.5% BHP +0.4% Arena REIT +0.3% Boral +0.2% And the bottom five: Bellevue Gold -1.3% Aristocrat Leisure -1.3% ARB -1.1% Altium -0.9% Bapcor -0.8%",
