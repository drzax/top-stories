Premier Daniel Andrews made the announcement as part of Victoria's housing statement, a policy document aimed at boosting housing supply. The document notes that short-stay rental sites have become a \"popular feature\" of Victoria's visitor economy, but they have reduced the availability of properties for longer-term use. \"In Victoria, there are more than 36,000 short-stay accommodation places — with almost half of these in regional Victoria. More than 29,000 of those places are entire homes,\" the document states. \"These are places that cannot be used for longer-term accommodation or rented out on fixed-term agreements — so it makes sense that they should provide some benefit toward the places that can.\" The 7.5 per cent levy will apply to revenue from the platforms and will go towards Homes Victoria, to fund the construction of social and affordable housing across the state, the document says. The levy on short-stay accommodation is the first in Australia, opening the possibility of other states following suit.",

That's almost the equivalent weight of two cars ! In a statement, the Navy said it had captured a small motor boat used for transporting people and cargo along the coast with five crew members heading to Africa. It comes after a series of operations held by the Navy to fight drug transportation along the country's coast. According to the Navy, more than 17 tons of cocaine have been seized since 2020. That's about as heavy as nine-and-a-half cars… and if you prefer animal weight comparisons, it's about the weight of 20 cows.",
