              "plaintext": "China's economy has beaten expectations in the third quarter, with GDP growth coming in at 1.3% for the September quarter and 4.9% year-on-year according to the National Bureau of Statistics. Market economists had generally expected 1% and 4.4% growth respectively. But, as is often the case with official Chinese government data, many in the market are somewhat sceptical. \"Our in-house China Activity Proxy (CAP) paints quite a different picture,\" writes Capital Economics' head of China economics Julian Evans-Pritchard. \"It suggests that growth slowed from 1.3% q/q in Q2 to 1.0% in Q3 and that cumulative growth since the end of 2019 is almost 6%-pts lower than official figures claim. \"But even the CAP suggests things are starting to improve again. In monthly terms, it shows that output bottomed out in June, with the economy since regaining some momentum. That's a trend that appears to have continued in September, judging by the latest activity data.\" And, while things may be substantially weaker than the official figures suggest, Mr Evans-Pritchard says the economic turnaround is real. \" The economy has clearly turned a corner thanks to policy support. And we anticipate a further recovery over the coming quarters.\" ANZ's China economists Raymond Yeung and Zhaopeng Xing say this recovery may see a wind-back in economic support from the central government and policymakers. \"Government officials will be feeling confident about achieving a growth target of 5%,\" they note. \"They could therefore scale down the intensity of stimulus measures. They do see the issue of household and private sector confidence, so will stick to a more targeted approach in formulating policy, going forward. \"Despite the data improvement, the output gap remains negative as indicated by weak domestic prices (CPI 0.0%). The weakness in investment suggests the real interest rate is too high. We expect the People's Bank of China to reduce the 1y Loan Prime Rate by 5bp on Friday. \" They have put together a handy ready reckoner for recent Chinese economic data, which shows it's been generally positive.",

With Israel's ground invasion of Gaza becoming more likely, CommSec's commodities analyst Vivek Dhar says it will see prices soar even higher. The current thinking of a long occupation would push Brent oil futures above $US100 a barrel, Mr Dhar says, \"because it raises the risk that the Israel‑Hamas conflict expands and potentially draws in Iran directly\". \"A direct confrontation between Iran and Israel will likely see oil infrastructure targeted ,\" he said. \"The most substantial disruption risk for oil markets is any blockade of the Strait of Hormuz. The narrow waterway, controlled by Iran, oversees the transit of 15‑20 million barrels per day of oil (15‑20% of global supply).\" Mr Dhar also noted that should there be a \"relatively short\" ground invasion, it would not be without risks — and could expand the conflict on \"several fronts\". \"Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir‑Abdollahian already warned earlier this week that 'the time for political solutions is running out and the possible expansion of the war on other fronts is approaching the inevitable stage',\" Mr Dhar said. Gas markets are also bracing for a potential escalation, with around a third of global LNG passing through the Strait of Hormuz, with Mr Dhar noting that Egypt's LNG exports have been negatively impacted by Israel's decision to shut off its Tamar gas field.",

Whitehaven will pay $US2.1 billion ($3.3 billion) upfront for the two mines that produce the type of coal used in steelmaking. The buyer will then pay a further $US500 million ($785 million) on both the first and second anniversaries of the completion date, with a final $US100 million ($157 million) payment on the third. The company will also pay up to a further $US900 million ($1.4 billion) over three years, contingent on coal pricing exceeding agreed thresholds. Whitehaven said the deal would be funded through available cash reserves, a $US900 million bridging loan and cashflows from the expanded business over the next three financial years. It also said it would consider selling minority stakes in the mines to global steel producers, which would reduce funding requirements. The company expects to complete the deal in the June quarter next year, subject to regulatory approvals. \"This transformational acquisition will pivot our portfolio towards metallurgical coal, which has been a core pillar of our strategy for many years making this a better balanced business,\" said Whitehaven CEO Paul Flynn. \"Our thermal coal business remains strategically important as we continue to provide much-needed coal products to support the global energy transition and as customers seek our high-quality and high-CV products to limit their emissions.\" Whitehaven shares were up nearly 15% to $7.80 by 2:52pm AEDT in response to the announcement. BHP shares were up 0.5% to $45.80, roughly in line with broader gains across the mining sector.",
