The passing has been precise, the defensive lines have been solid. And the forwards look hungry for goals. Hayley Raso has been absolutely immense. She's been showing up at left-back, winning possession, setting up her teammates and banging them in the back of the net. This performance will go down in folklore. Here's how Sam Lewis saw it at the MRS. What a half from Australia. Exactly what they needed, exactly when they needed it. Two goals to Hayley Raso - and a third that was called offside to Mary Fowler in between - and even though Canada have dominated possession, they haven't dominated the game. This is such a different shift in tone from the Nigeria match: the Matildas have looked confident both on and off the ball, choreographed in their transitional plays, and defensively resolute. Kyra Cooney-Cross is having a blinder in midfield, as is Clare Hunt at centre-back. This 45 minutes will be a huge confidence-booster for the team. Hopefully they can manage this game in the next 45, and captain Sam Kerr won't need to be risked at all.",

Two goals to Hayley Raso - and a third that was called offside to Mary Fowler in between - and even though Canada have dominated possession, they haven't dominated the game. This is such a different shift in tone from the Nigeria match: the Matildas have looked confident both on and off the ball, choreographed in their transitional plays, and defensively resolute. Kyra Cooney-Cross is having a blinder in midfield, as is Clare Hunt at centre-back. This 45 minutes will be a huge confidence-booster for the team. Hopefully they can manage this game in the next 45, and captain Sam Kerr won't need to be risked at all."
