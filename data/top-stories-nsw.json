Without a majority in the Senate, the government will need support from the crossbench – but it'll also have to convince Australians — with a new poll (of only 1606 voters) suggesting support has slipped below a majority. The Assistant Minister for Indigenous Australians, Malarndirri McCarthy, says she feels excited by what she is hearing from Australians, but admits the Coalition's campaign is \"having an impact\". \"I'm conscious that here on Capital Hill people do like to say all sorts of things, and perhaps without really any care or responsibility,\" she says. \"But when you're on the ground, out there, as I've been, with First Nations people, and see the deep hurt that they've experienced for decades, over policies that should never have occurred, and if they feel they can have a say, that this is something that's important to them. \"Then I say to politicians here, this may not matter to you, but it matters to First Nations people on the ground. \"And I say to my senators, and my colleagues, all of them, on every side, keep this debate in the next fortnight enormously respectful. \"We can do this as a country, in a very dignified, respectable way. So it should be in the debate.\"",

The Scary Movie star wrote on Instagram that a gate agent told him he had too many bags, and that he would have to check in his luggage rather than carry it on. Wayans, who says his treatment constitutes harassment, reportedly took his ticket, pushed past an employee and tried to board the plane from Denver to Kansas City. He booked a later flight, saying he would rather fly coach on another airline than fly first-class on United. He apologised to his fans in Kansas City for missing a performance. \"Sorry KC I'm gonna miss tonight's shows due to a United gate agent who probably hated White Chicks,\" Wayans says on Twitter, referring to his 2004 movie which also starred his brother Shawn Wayans. Wayans must appear in court in Denver on July 11 on a citation of disturbing the peace.",
