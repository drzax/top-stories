Is this the first real indication of an implosion in Russia? A real test of wills from here on. Isabella: This is big. It will be a test of Vladimir Putin’s grip on power. The Russian president has not faced a domestic threat like this through the course of the 16-month full scale invasion. Putin is taking it seriously, and has come out swinging, accusing Prighozin of “treason,” posturing the national armed forces, and securing big cities. But we should be clear, this is not a military coup. Prigozhin’s is only the head of the private military company Wagner - who have been critical to some of Moscow’s wins on the battle field. For now he is directing his challenge at defence chiefs, and the top brass, but not directly at President Putin. He is not trying to end the war in Ukraine but trying to challenge Moscow’s decision makers and settle his own scores. Prighozin has been furious with Russia’s military leadership for some time, claiming for months his troops were left without the weapons and support they needed. But things have escalated quickly and while Putin was once close with Prighozin he has clearly lost control of him. This challenge may fall apart, but at the very least it will leave big holes in Russia’s military effort in Ukraine who have relied heavily on Prighozin’s mercenaries.",
