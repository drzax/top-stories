She is well trained, has no notable history of abuse and has been a delight to welcome into our home. Thanks Stephen and Heidi for you questions! I've put this to both Dr Karishma and Laura V. Dr Karishma: Breaking habits, especially ones that are intermittent can be a challenging and lengthy process. The first step is trying to identify the trigger for this behaviour. Some common reasons include territorial spraying if they are not desexed, from urinary incontinence, old age, osteoarthritis, dementia, stress/fear/anxiety - even to noise outside, kidney disease, diabetes, cushing's disease, or urinary tract infections/stones in the bladder. It's important to get your pet checked at the vet to identify any of these underlying issues. Once a trigger has been identified, it usually will make things easier to treat, especially if there is an underlying medical issue. If these things have been ruled out, then re-training your dog may include things like increasing toilet breaks - especially after sleep and rewarding them for peeing in appropriate places. As well as ensuring area's where they have previously urinated are thoroughly cleaned with an enzymatic cleaner that eliminates the smell so they can't recognoise that smell.And considering pheromone collars and diffuser's in the house to help they feel comfortable in their environment if they are an anxious dog. And here's Laura V's take: Laura V: Dogs will wee inside the house for a number of reasons - they have not been trained properly to go outdoors, or they have an underlying anxiety, or they have an underlying medical problem. If it is occasional, try to identify the pattern. If you can predict it, then you can prevent it, by calling your dog outside to the toilet. Putting your dog on a lead can also help as you can manage their behaviour more consistently, preventing them from sneaking away to wee in another room. There is always the possibility that your dog has an underlying infection or disease that needs to be addressed by your vet, so a check up is well worth it. Punishing dogs for having accidents inside only makes them more anxious and can make them more likely to sneak away in another room when you're not looking.",

Any advice? Thanks for your question Luke! Yard-digging is another one of those universal behaviours that seem to be tricky to navigate. Here's Laura V 's take: Laura V: When does she dig? When you're not home? Does she dig if she has access to indoors (as in, if she is unable to get inside, does this stimulate the behaviour)? Sometimes dogs will dig to alleviate stress, but other times, they are doing normal dog stuff. Digging has an important role in canine behaviour. So, it may have nothing to do with how much exercise she is getting. It may be about how she is feeling when she is outside. Once you can answer this question, you can begin to address the behaviour. We always want to discover the cause of a behaviour before trying to change it. And, if the behaviour is not bothering your dog, a place to dig may be of value to her. Sometimes problem behaviours are behaviours that bother us, not our dog. This is an important distinction to make.",

Given her age is resource guarding able to be fixed? Is it difficult? Would I need to get a professional trainer? I have read that resource guarding gets worst with age. Alice : How do I stop my dog from resource guarding? Steve : How do you teach a dog how to stop resource guarding? He is fine most of the time, but as soon as he guards something, it's like a switch has been flicked. We try and remove everything off the floor, but sometimes he finds even a clothes peg to guard. Thank you. Resource guarding is another topic that's come up a bit so thank you all for your questions. Here's Laura V 's advice: Laura V: Guarding a resource is generally motivated by the fear of losing that valued item. This can cause dogs a great deal of distress, so it is really important we don't threaten our dogs, as this can be unsafe for all involved. If it is food, teach your dog that there is a room where the food is given. Close the door and allow the dog to eat their food in peace. Never try to take the food away. If your dog is a puppy and you're wanting to prevent this guarding behaviour, walking past your dog's bowl should result in you adding food to the bowl, not taking the food away. If your dog guards other items such as balls or even people, it is critical that we remove the need to feel that way. i.e. have two balls where you can exchange one for the other. For guarding people, I'd recommend getting some professional help. The reason for this is that we are dealing with some very heightened emotions, that need to be addressed gently from someone experienced in the field.",
