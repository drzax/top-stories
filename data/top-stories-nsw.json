The committee heard yesterday that Deloitte boss Adam Powick was paid $3.5 million, while sacked former PWC boss Tom Seymour was paid $4.6 million.

The deal saw more than 32 million tonnes of Ukrainian grain exported to 45 countries over the past year through its Black Sea ports. Rabobank senior grains analyst Dennis Voznesenski says grain prices have been on a rollercoaster since the agreement expired overnight as the market \"attempts to decodify the impact on international trade flows\". \"The main question will be whether Ukraine continues to export through the Black Sea without the safety of the grain corridor. \"Prices will continue to be volatile until the market is able to decipher the end impact,\" he said. Mr Voznesenski says Ukraine has been building up alternatives to its Black Sea grain ports, but they can't fully compensate for the loss of port access. âMore than 40 per cent of Ukraineâs grains and oil seeds exports moved through the grain corridor in recent months, with the remainder moving over road and rail into eastern Europe and through the Danube river system. \"The Danube river system export capacity has been increasing substantially since the war started, but more expansion will take time.â He also says the expiry of the deal could affect Russia's grain exports. \"Any exemptions that Russia was given by the West in return to signing up to the grain corridor will likely become void, possibly slowing its export abilities.\"",
