He said 23 people, including 20 Australians, had registered with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and left Gaza through the Rafah border crossing. “They were met by Australian consular officials who are on the ground in Egypt who were able to provide assistance with ongoing travel arrangements,” he said. “Crossings like this are the result of an enormous effort from Australian consular officials and diplomats in the region.” He said the 20 Australians were in contact with consular services but did not say if they would fly back to Australia or elsewhere. “I have heard from so many Australians how much it means to hear an Australian accent, someone from their home country to help them out,” he said. There are no planned repatriation flights for those still stuck in Gaza, with the government saying they can only point to commercial flights for those people.",

He told me he went to the border crossing but decided to go back into Gaza when Egyptian officials wouldn’t let his wife leave with him. Samah is a Palestinian with a visa for Australia, but the officials said she had to stay. \"They said, 'No, you can’t take your wife with you. You can go. She has to stay'. I said, 'No, I can’t leave my wife behind, she's my wife',\" he said. The 77-year-old said it was devastating for the couple to go back into Gaza. \"It's a nightmare, worse than a nightmare,\" he said \"[There's] no food, no water, no fuel, no bread.\" Abdullah's son Shaher said the Australian government had expected both would be able to leave. \"The Australian authorities provided a list to Egypt and Israel, as I understand it, which included my dad and his wife and I was advised earlier today that a revised list had been produced by the Egyptian and Israeli authorities, which effectively omitted her from the list,\" he said. The Israeli military told a media briefing it had checked the names of foreign citizens trying to leave Gaza to make sure they were not linked to the listed terrorist group Hamas, which controls the enclave. It's not clear why Samah was not allowed to go, but it may be because she is not an Australian citizen. Another Australian family told the ABC their relatives could not get to the checkpoint to get out, because Israeli air strikes made the route too dangerous. They said the road south from central and northern parts of Gaza was \"like hell\".",

In a statement the military said its fighter jets had struck a Hamas command and control complex in Jabalia \"based on precise intelligence\", killing the head of the Islamist group's anti-tank missile unit, Muhammad A'sar. \"Hamas deliberately builds its terror infrastructure under, around and within civilian buildings, intentionally endangering Gazan civilians,\" the statement said. There was no immediate word on possible casualties from the second explosion. It comes a day after Palestinian health officials said an Israeli air strike had killed about 50 people and injured 150 at Jabalia. Palestinians sifted through rubble in a desperate hunt for people trapped underneath after Wednesday's strike on the camp. \"It is a massacre,\" one witness of the strike said. Israel has said Tuesday's strike on the same camp killed Ibrahim Biari, who it said was a ringleader of what it called the \"murderous terror attack\" on October 7. Reporting by Reuters",

A big night on Wall Street, with the US Federal Reserve opting to hold interest rates steady at 5.25-5.5% for the second straight meeting. The decision to keep rates on hold was widely expected, but comments after the meeting from Fed chair Jerome Powell have left markets feeling confident another rate rise is unlikely, according to OANDA's senior market analyst for the Americas Edward Moya. \"The Fed did not rule out a rate increase in the coming months, but swap contracts showed traders weren't convinced. \"The Fed tried to deliver a hawkish hold but Wall Street is not believing additional tightening will happen this cycle. The odds for a quarter-point rate rise by the end of January fell from 41% to 29%. \"Key quote: 'Tighter financial and credit conditions for households and businesses are likely to weigh on economic activity, hiring, and inflation.' \"This meeting the Fed is also acknowledging the tightening of financial conditions, and not just credit. Some might take this as a sign that the bond market will continue to help them with this tightening cycle, which could support the argument that a peak in rates is in place.\" Markets are currently pricing in a near certainty (99.5%) that the Fed will at least remain on hold until the end of this year. The tech heavy, and somewhat more speculative, Nasdaq was the prime beneficiary, jumping 1.6%, with the S & P 500 (1.1%) and Dow Jones Industrial Average (0.7%) posting smaller gains. The ASX futures are pointing to a similarly positive open locally, up 0.8%. But for mortgage borrowers hoping a Fed hold increases the odds of an RBA one, the market has bad news for you — money traders are still pricing in a better than 60% chance of an Aussie rate rise next Tuesday. Stay with us to see how Australian and regional traders respond to the latest hit out from the Fed.",
