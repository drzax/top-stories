The RBA kept official interest rates on hold at 4.1 per cent despite warning that inflation was too high. Here's more from Peter: The Reserve Bank board left official interest rates on hold a fortnight ago on fears that more hikes could trigger an unanticipated spike in unemployment by the end of the year. Minutes from the RBA Board’s meeting on July 4 show concerns that higher interest rates would force households to save more and most likely impact a so-far resilient jobs market. “Members observed there was considerable uncertainty about the resilience of household consumption,” the minutes say. “The squeeze of many households’ finances would ... encourage households to save more which would affect consumption. “If that were to occur, the demand for labour would slow and the unemployment rate would be likely to rise beyond the rate required to ensure inflation returns to target.”",
