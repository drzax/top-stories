A diver who arrived on the scene just after the attack said people had rushed to help the victim after a lifeguard from a nearby hotel raised the alarm, but were not able to reach him in time. Russia's TASS news agency said the person killed was a Russian man born in 1999 who lived in Egypt full-time and was not a tourist. The ministry says it caught the shark and examined it in a laboratory in an attempt to determine the reasons for the rare attack. Tiger sharks are a large species which reside in tropical and temperate waters, and are among sharks most cited by the International Shark Attack File for unprovoked attacks on humans.",

It comes after the city skyline turned orange earlier in the week: The air is looking a little clearer now, but officials are warning residents to stay inside and limit outdoor activities. The smoke-clogged air has created silhouetted skylines as it stopped actors from performing on Broadway, delayed thousands of flights and sparked a resurgence in mask wearing and remote work. New York City is seeing a \"higher than usual\" number of asthma-related visits to the emergency room, city Health Department spokesperson Pedro Frisneda says. The dangerous smoke is expected to hang around even into the weekend, impacting millions of people across the US and Canada. Canada's fire season is just getting started, but could become the worst on record, as more than 400 blazes — over a third of them in Quebec — burned on Thursday.",

Stephanie Chalmers here to take you through the day, and it's looking set to be a pretty positive start to the session with futures pointing higher. It follows some decent gains on Wall Street, particularly for tech stocks. Amazon rose 2.5%, while Netflix ended up 2.4%. Electric carmaker Tesla also did well, rising 4.6%. The US dollar came under some pressure as oil prices slumped, and some data on weekly jobless claims was worse than expected, which helped the Aussie dollar above 67 US cents. In Europe, markets were mostly higher but eurozone economic growth was revised lower for the first quarter, down 0.1 per cent. And since that's the second quarter of economic contraction in a row, that means a 'technical recession'. It's been a pretty massive week, with the Reserve Bank raising rates for a 12th time and Australia's economic growth slowing, so stick with us, ahead of what's a long weekend in some states (the ASX will be closed on Monday).",
