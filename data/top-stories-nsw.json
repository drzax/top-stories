Strong gains in mining and energy stocks helped to lift the ASX 200 index up 0.6%, to close at 7,324 points. The miners rose after iron ore prices closed higher overnight, boosted by heightened expectations of more supportive measures from China following weaker-than-expected economic data. Rio Tinto fell 0.7%, after the mining giant flagged concerns about a global economic slowdown, and reported its second-quarter iron ore shipments missed analysts' estimates, BHP and Fortescue Metals fell 0.3% and 1.9% respectively. Woodside Energy climbed 1.4% even after reporting its second-quarter revenue missed estimates due to weaker liquefied natural gas prices and maintenance work at some of its facilities in Western Australia. Fuel retailer Ampol gained 4.4% after revealing its Lytton refinery margin for June improved to $US12.69 per barrel, reflecting improved production mix as the refinery returned to normal operations by the end of May as planned. BrainChip Holdings surged 6.8% to mark its best day in six weeks after the advanced AI chipmaker received a patent grant in the United States on one of its neuromorphic processors. Neuromorphic processors mimic the way the brain works and allow devices to use signals from physical neurons to carry out computations. On the flip side, Northern Star Resources plunged 5.8% after unveiling its full-year production forecast (which fell short of market expectations).",
