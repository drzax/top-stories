The Reserve Bank says 15 per cent of all variable rate housing loan borrowers will experience negative cashflows by the end of the year if there are no changes to their spending. Mr Kouloulas says that could also factor into the RBA's thinking. \"At this stage the softer economy, the pipeline of financial stress on alot of mortgage holders which is still to impact on actual spending decisions, is something that will probably cause them to sit tight for now.\" He spoke to my colleague David Chau on the ABC News Channel.",

Here's what some economists are saying in the wake of the ABS data. David Bassanese from Betashares: \"At face value todayâs lift in the annual rate of headline CPI inflation from 6.3% to 6.8% could be a cause for concern, suggesting pricing pressure remains stubbornly firm and the Reserve Bank needs to lift interest rates further. \"Digging below the surface, however, the recent disinflationary trend still seems intact. The RBA need not yet have to reach for its gun just yet - especially given other signs of a cooling economy such as weaker building approvals and consumer spending. \"At this stage it is still too early to tell if Australiaâs disinflationary trend is waning, suggesting the RBA still has a little more time on its hands before deciding whether to lift interest rates again. \"That said, there is a growing risk of at least one and possibly two further rate rises in coming months, especially if the resilience in the United States economy - and its own stubborn inflation pressures - forces the US Federal Reserve to embark on further monetary tightening.\" Dr Brendan Rynne, chief economist at KPMG: \"Australian inflation developments are similar to what is being seen in most advanced economies, with headline inflation peaking and core inflation cooling. However, inflation remains high, and services prices are sticky, driven by wages growth higher than inflation targets, which maintains concerns over a wage-price spiral. \"While      todayâs CPI data shows an increase in headline inflation, this direction      is mostly anticipated given the base effects from automotive fuel and the      disequilibrium in the rental market driving rent inflation. \"With      underlying inflation coming down, and most categories easing, coupled with      unemployment picking up and retail volumes seeing negative growth, we      believe the RBA is likely to keep the cash rate unchanged in next weekâs      meeting, to give it time to assess additional data flows.\"",

So over the year fuel prices increased as the fuel excise returned to its normal level. The fuel excise for petrol, diesel, and all other fuel and petroleum based products was halved for six months on March 30 2022 as a cost of living relief measure. That saw the rates for petrol and diesel fall from 44.2 cents to 22.1 cents a litre. Here is Michelle Marquardt, head of prices statistics, at the Bureau of Statistics. âItâs important to note that a significant contributor to the increase in the annual movement in April was automotive fuel.\" \"The halving of the fuel excise tax in April 2022, which was fully unwound in October 2022, is impacting the annual movement for April 2023.\" She says taking out volatile items like petrol and food means the monthly Consumer Price Index comes in at 6.5 per cent in April, lower than the 6.9 per cent recorded in March.",
