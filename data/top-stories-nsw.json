The rare State Department alert says: \"Due to increased tensions in various locations around the world, the potential for terrorist attacks, demonstrations or violent actions against US citizens and interests, the Department of State advises US citizens overseas to exercise increased caution .\" It advises travelling Americans to stay alert in locations frequented by tourists, sign up for the Smart Traveler program and follow the State Department on social media. Earlier this week, the State Department warned Americans against travelling to Lebanon. The US embassy in its capital, Beirut, has been one of many Middle Eastern locations where demonstrations erupted after Tuesday's hospital blast in Gaza.
