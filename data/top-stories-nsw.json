Iran sat deep and defended like their lives depended on it, throwing themselves in front of every cross and pass aimed towards their penalty area, with goalkeeper Zahra Khajavi having a stand-out performance. It was an experimental side from Tony Gustavsson, with several big names starting on the bench, and there was a noticeable lack of chemistry and cohesion among some of the newer players. But that just made the introduction of the World Cup stars even more effective, with Mary Fowler and Steph Catley in particular adding a different level of quality to the contest. It's always a challenge breaking down deep defensive blocks, which is something the Matildas have traditionally struggled with, especially in Asian competitions. With two games left against opponents who could pull out similar tactics, Australia will have to be smarter and more patient in their attacking phases, and far more clinical in front of goal. But in the end, a win is a win, and this was a game as much about shaking off the rust as it was getting the three points. Australia will next face the Philippines on Sunday afternoon at Optus Stadium, kicking off at 6:10pm AEDT. And I'll be back on the blog to take you through it all! Thanks so much for joining us tonight, and go Tillies!",
