Local television station Fox 35 says more than a dozen popular rides at the Orlando theme park were closed after the bear was sighted in a tree, including the Haunted Mansion and Pirates of the Caribbean rides. Lisa Thompson, a spokesperson for the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, said in a statement that the bear was likely searching for food in the area. \"During the fall, bears are more active as they search for food to pack on fat reserves for the winter,\" she said. \"In most cases, it is best for bears to be given space and to move along on their own. \"But given this situation, staff have captured the animal and are relocating the bear out of the park to an area in or around the Ocala National Forest.\"",

The 150 million-year-old Camptosaurus was discovered in the 1990s in the US state of Wyoming. It was named after palaeontologist Barry James who first restored it in 2000. Italian laboratory Zoic, which acquired \"Barry\" last year, has done further restoration work on the skeleton. Alexandrew Giquello, from the auction house Hotel Drouot, says it is unusual to see a dinosaur skeleton so intact. \"To take the example of its skull, the skull is complete at 90 per cent and the rest of the dinosaur is complete at 80 per cent,\" he says. Giquello says dinosaur specimens on the art market remain rare, with no more than a couple of sales a year worldwide.",

Around Australia's coastline there are around 1 million tonnes of pipelines, fixed rigs, and floating vessels. Much of the infrastructure is due to be decommissioned and operators are required to clean up the sites. Back in August 2009, the Montara wellhead platform owned by PTTP Australasia in the Timor Sea suffered a well head blowout that caused an uncontrolled leak of oil and gas. The spill was not contained until November2009, the worst oil spill in Australia's history. So could it happen again? As my colleague Linton Besser reports, while oil and gas firms are legally required to clean up their sites, some don't want to pay the cost, which is estimated at more than $60 billion.",

The big news overnight is that X (the company formerly known as Twitter) is looking at charging users a small monthly fee in order to combat bots and spam. That's according to owner Elon Musk, who raised the plans during a livestreamed conversation with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Mr Musk did not mention the timing of the plan to charge users or how much it would cost. He also said that X has 550 million monthly users, but didn't say how many of them were bots. And US stocks went nowhere as investors were awaiting this week's meeting of the US Federal Reserve, which is expected to leave official US interest rates on hold at 5 to 5.25 per cent. All the major indices ended flat. Spot gold is a bit higher, and oil prices jumped again as more production cuts loom. While the Australian dollar slipped slightly to 64.35 US cents from a high of 64.49 US cents overnight. Join me for all today's markets news.",
