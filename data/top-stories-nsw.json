The airline will remove the expiry date on COVID travel credits (that were due to run out at the end of this year). Around $2 billion worth of COVID credits were issued when borders closed in March 2020 and flights were grounded. In June, Qantas said around $400 million in credits still had not been used. The changes mean Qantas travel credit customers can request a cash refund at any point and Jetstar credit can be used for travel indefinitely. In a video message to customers, CEO Alan Joyce said he knows the credit system was not as smooth as it should have been. \"While we've improved it recently, and extended the expiry date several times, people lost faith in the process. We hope this helps change that.\"",

However, the results were more than a third down on last year's profit of $811 million. Harvey Norman enjoyed strong sales and profits during the COVID-19 pandemic, with customers buying home furnishings and office supplies during lockdowns. But franchise and company-operated sales revenue was down this year as many Australians struggle with the rising cost of living. Chairman Gerry Harvey said the company has delivered 40% growth in net assets since the beginning of the pandemic. \"Our balance sheet remains strong with total assets of $7.67 billion, anchored by a $4 billion property portfolio.\" While the majority of its stores are in Australia, Harvey Norman has stores across 8 countries including New Zealand, Singapore and Ireland. The retailer plans to expand to 80 stores in Malaysia by the end of 2028, including a further 8 stores this year. The company will pay a final dividend of 12 cents per share, taking the full-year dividend to 25 cents per share, down from 37.5 cents last year.",
