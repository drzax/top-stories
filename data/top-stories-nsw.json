              "plaintext": "The Australian Competition Tribunal has upheld a decision to block a network sharing agreement between major telcos Telstra and TPG. The deal would've seen TPG decommission or transfer regional mobile sites, and then acquire mobile services from Telstra. TPG says it would've increased its mobile network coverage from 96 per cent to 98.8 per cent of the Australian population. At the end of last year, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission rejected the plans, arguing there was a real risk it would reduce investment in infrastructure. Telstra and TPG challenged the decision but now the Australian Competition Tribunal has upheld it. \"This determination entrenches the status quo for mobile coverage in regional Australia,\" TPG boss Iñaki Berroeta said today. TPG is now considering its options for a further appeal. At the time it blocked the sharing deal, the ACCC said there would be some short-term benefits in improving TPG's network coverage, but that it could lessen infrastructure-based competition. \"Competition between separate mobile networks drives companies to improve coverage for mobile users and to offer new technologies to more areas. \"For example, when Optus improves its regional network, Telstra responds by improving its network to maintain its market position,\" ACCC Commissioner Liza Carver said in December. \"Infrastructure competition is what drives investments by mobile companies in broader, deeper and faster mobile coverage… We have concluded the proposed arrangements would likely significantly weaken this competitive process.\"",
