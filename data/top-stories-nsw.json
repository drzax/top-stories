Council staff and emergency services addressed residents in a virtual meeting this afternoon, and say there is no more expected weather events over the coming days set to increase flood risk. âWe have a very clear and well understood flood plan that has been in practice for a number of years now and over the last couple of floods, so that has been enacted,â Wangaratta Councilâs Director of Community and Infrastructure Marcus Goonan said. âYou will see us closing footpaths, and car parks, and roads, etc., proactively.â Mr Goonan said councilâs primary focus is on securing the cityâs levees. âEveryone would realise over the last couple of years we have been upgrading those levees,â he said. âThereâs no concern around levees at the moment. âEven at the top end of that moderate flood and even the bottom end of a major, thereâs no concern for our levee structures.â There will be no relief centre opening in Wangaratta. Residents who are concerned should ensure they have enacted their flood plan and have an emergency kit that contains medications, documentations, and a plan for their pets, and well as access to a radio or the VicEmergency app. Residents can access sandbags at the corner of Great Road and Handley Street in Wangaratta, or attend the nearby SES unit if they require staff assistance.
