The federal government is giving the industry until the middle of next year to develop and implement a voluntary code of practice, warning companies it will step in and force them to act if they fail to clean up their platforms. \"The levels of harassment, abuse and technologically facilitated abuse are at too high levels,\" Social Services Minister Amanda Rishworth says. \"And if we are going to end violence against women and children in one generation, then we need to address these online dating apps.\" An investigation by the Australian Institute of Criminology last year found three-quarters of online daters had been subject to some kind of online sexual violence in the past five years. Kath Albury from Swinburne University has spent years researching behaviours on online dating and social media platforms, and says users reported a wide variety of problematic experiences. \"The harms range from receiving unwanted contact or images — unwanted texts and images that maybe are using slurs or sexually explicit when a person hasn't consented to receiving sexually explicit communication,\" Professor Albury says. \"And they range from that kind of day-to-day, the equivalent of flashing in the offline environment or on-street harassment — someone yelling out a comment to you, that's what it feels like with that kind of contact — to, at times, racist or discriminatory language, transphobic language, stalking in some cases, and in other cases quite threatening behaviours — so moving from the dating apps on to other social platforms to stalk, or offline stalking or indeed physical harassment.\"",

Thousands of people have been killed due to flooding during a powerful storm that struck Libya's eastern coast last Monday, and left thousands more missing. Libyan authorities have now confirmed that 150 people have been poisoned by polluted water in the country's flood-hit areas. Mohamed Wanis Tajouri says he has travelled to Derna — one of the worst-affected cities — with fellow medical students to carry out disinfection and sterilisation work. \"After floods, epidemics occur,\" he says. Locals have been advised to drink bottled water and to avoid areas with stagnated water. Aid agencies have flown in to help and some countries have sent supplies, but international officials say much more help is needed. Meanwhile, three members of a Greek rescue team have been killed in a road accident on the way to Derna from Libya's capital Benghazi, the Greek armed forces say. They say another two members are still missing .",

Earlier this month, footage was shared online of Surfer Higor Fiuza and his three-year-old bredli carpet python, Shiva, gliding through Rainbow Bay. Senior Wildlife Officer Jonathan McDonald from the Department of Environment and Science says a fine has since been handed to Fiuza. \"Our investigation found the man had a permit to keep native animals, but he was issued with a penalty infringement notice for the breaching section 88a of the Nature Conservation Act ,\" he says. \" Permit holders are not allowed to take animals from their licenced premises unless taking them to a vet or, selling or giving the animal to another permit holder or taking it to an authorised display.\" He says taking native pets out in public could cause them \"unecessary stress\" or to behave in \"an unpredictable way\". \"There is also the threat of spreading diseases to native wildlife when people take captive-bred reptiles out in public,\" he says. \"Snakes are obviously cold-blooded animals, and while they can swim, reptiles generally avoid water. \"The python would have found the water to be extremely cold, and the only snakes that should be in the ocean are sea snakes.\"",

Wheatstone is one of the Chevron facilities affected by 24-hour workers strikes, along with its Gorgon site, with the strikes beginning over the weekend. The two LNG facilities account for over 5% of global supply, and the strikers were an escalation of what had been six days of brief work stoppages and limited bans on certain tasks. \"Chevron Australia confirms full production resumed last night (September 17) at the Wheatstone Gas Facility following a fault on September 14,\" a Chevron spokesperson said in a statement. \"During this time LNG continued to be produced at approximately 80% of usual rates, and vessel loading continued. \"There has been no change to scheduled LNG deliveries. Domestic gas facilities and supply were unaffected .\" Chevron has asked the Fair Work Commission to intervene in the ongoing dispute over wages and conditions in a bid to cancel the strikes. The commission will hold a hearing on Friday. The strikes were set to run until the end of this month but the Offshore Alliance union, a coalition of two unions, on Saturday flagged they intend to file a notice with Chevron to extend their work stoppage plans .",

Perseus issued a statement on the ASX this morning that it's extended the operational life of its Yaouré Gold Mine in Côte d’Ivoire, West Africa, for at least 12 years (until 2035) with the potential for further extension if there are additional discoveries. \"When Perseus acquired Yaouré as a development project in 2016, the possibility of extending the life of the mine through development of an underground operation was not part of the plan,\" CEO Jeff Quartermaine said. \"However, our discovery, and subsequent engineering and planning, that has led to today's announcement, bears testament to Perseus's in-house ability to create significant value through organic growth.\" That's given gold miners (and investors) a solid boost in sentiment.
