While you were sleeping, there was a bounce of optimism in the United States, as its citizens were reassured by their president that \"America will not default\". \"I’m confident that we'll get the agreement on the budget,\" Joe Biden added. The United States is facing the prospect of defaulting on trillions of dollars worth of loans, unless the Republicans and Democrats strike a deal to legally allow the US Department of Treasury to incur more debt, which would allow it to pay its bills. US Treasury officials say that, unless a deal is reached, the US risks running out of money to pay its debts as soon as June 1, and this could trigger a recession, sparking fears of a global economic and financial crisis. But those comments by Biden have seemed to soothe equity markets there, at least, for now. And of course, Australian shares are set to follow. Meanwhile, the US dollar rose overnight, pushing the Australian currency against the greenback slightly down to 66.62 US cents. Let's hope those sixes aren't ominous. Here in Australia, we have labour force data out at 11:30am AEST. Will Australia’s unemployment remain steady at near a 50 year low of 3.5 per cent, or will we start to get an uptick as interest rates crimp demand? We'll be here keeping you updated.",
