Well, it's Tottenham's best start to a season in the English top flight since 1960/61. That team, led by the legendary coach Bill Nicholson, won the Division 1 title that year as well as the FA Cup, becoming the first team to win English football's Double in the 20th century. That was Tottenham's last top-flight title and, although it's important not to get too far ahead of ourselves, Ange does have a history of claiming drought-ending titles. At South Melbourne he broke a seven-year drought, at Yokohoma F Marinos he ended a 15-year barren run and, at Celtic, he ended a lengthy one-year Scottish Premiership drought (everything's relative). No team that has taken 26 points from their first 10 games of a Premier League season (the English top flight since 1992) has finished anywhere lower than third.",
