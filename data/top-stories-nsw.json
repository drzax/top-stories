The bank now expects a higher peak cash rate of 4.6 per cent and a delay to the first rate cut in 2024 from February to May. Westpac's previous forecast was growth of 1 per cent in 2023 to be followed by 1.5 per cent in 2024, based on a peak cash rate of 4.1 per cent. Westpac Chief Economist Bill Evans' now expects household consumption to grow by just 0.3 per cent in 2023 and 0.6 per cent in 2024. \"This consumption profile is consistent with the very weak measures of Consumer Sentiment we have seen since the onset of high inflation and rising interest rates in 2022,\" Mr Evans said. Mr Evans said the forecasts mean per capita spending recessions in both 2023 and 2024 of -1.5% in 2023 followed by -1.0% in 2024. It also implies GDP per capita recessions of -1.2% in 2023 and -0.6% in 2024. A per capita recession is when the economy continues to grow but living standards decline. \"Consumer spending prospects, in the face of high inflation and  sharply higher interest rates, would be even weaker were it not  for the substantial savings buffer that households accumulated  during the pandemic and the strong starting point for jobs,\" Mr Evans said. \"The  tightest labour market conditions in 50 years and still elevated  job vacancies are providing clear support to household incomes  and spending, but also give those households coming under  more intense financial pressure more scope to make adjustments.\"",
