Mr Chalmers has been speaking to the Property Council of Australia in the Northern Territory this morning. \"One of the big priorities we came into government with was getting the Budget on a more sustainable footing,\" he says. \"And the improvements in revenue that we’ve seen in recent times – driven by a combination of good prices for our exports and a consistently strong labour market – have helped us in that task. \" Mr Chalmers says restraining annual real spending growth and finding $40 billion worth of savings have helped the bottom line. \"We said in May that we expected all this to result in a surplus for 2022-23 – the first in 15 years.\" \"We were deliberately cautious and conservative, restrained and responsible when it came to this, given this history.\" \"So, I’m pleased to say that two days out from the end of the financial year, we’re still on track.\" \"In fact, we’re in a significantly better position than we forecast.\" \"Today, I can reveal that we’re expecting the surplus will be bigger than forecast in May.\"",

The Dow Jones index put on 0.6 per cent. New orders for US manufactured capital goods rose in May, sales of new single family homes surged, and US consumer confidence increased to the highest in nearly one and half years. And oil prices slumped more than 2 per cent on signs of more rate rises from central banks. The Australian dollar is trading around 66.87 US cents. Later this morning, the Bureau of Statistics will release consumer inflation figures for May. Inflation is expected to have risen by 6.1 per cent over the year, a pull back from the 6.8 per cent rise over the year to April. We will have the figures live when they are released at 11:30am AEST.",
