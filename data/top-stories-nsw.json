On Saturday, Australians will be asked whether they support enshrining the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Voice in the constitution. The majority of polls suggest the referendum will not be successful. Noel Pearson, who is one of the architects of the Uluru Statement of the Heart, which put forward the Voice to Parliament, says that outcome would be disappointing. \"This is a moral choice for the country, not just a question of constitutional law,\" he told AM. \"The choice we have is not equivalent - Yes and No are not equivalent choices. \"Yes is of a different quality to No. No would be a travesty for the country.\" You can listen to the full interview on AM with Sabra Lane by taping the link below.",
