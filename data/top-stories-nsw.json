This questioner asked: \"Canada, UK, New  Zealand and USA have all started  their monetary targeting earlier  than Australia. Can you speak on the decisions thus far to be less  aggressive than our partners in our cash rate hikes, and given Australia inflation is higher than most of  these countries, is it potential for not us further but more aggressive targeting as well?\" Here's Lowe's reply: \"Most of the  central banks have higher interest rates than we have, so it is a good question about why we haven't raised rates even further. \"There are a  number of factors. The first is that normal wages growth in Australia is still lower than it is in most other advanced economies. The aggregate  level, wages are growing between 3.5 and 4%. \"In the US, Canada, the UK  and about 5%, in some cases above  6%. It is quite a difference. \"A  second, and this is related, that  supply in Australia is a lot more  flexible than other countries, our participation rate here is setting record highs every month. So the  domestic population, more and more have entered the labour force and  the supply side of labour is much  more flexible than in the US where the participation rate still hasn't got back to its previous peak. \"So  they are two reasons why the  underlying inflation pressures in  Australia are less than they are in some countries, and it is really  important that that remains the  case. \"If we saw Australia in the  same situation as in the US, Canada, UK, where wages were growing at 6%, that would have implications for our setting of monetary policy. The  other element is we have been  prepared to allow inflation to come back to target a bit more slowly and some other central banks.\" Lowe says the RBA is trying to preserve the labour market: \"We have been prepared to go a bit  slower to try and preserve those  gains in the labour market that we have got over the last two years. \"It took us nearly 50 years to get back to full employment. We are probably through that, but youth unemployment is the lowest it has been in  decades, people have been able to  get jobs, so there is a huge  economic and social benefit. \"So we took the decision to go a bit more slowly back to the target than some other central banks to try and  preserve that, and I still hope we can manage it.\"",

              "plaintext": "This question is being asked on behalf of Brisbane Girls Grammar, who won a competition to ask Philip Lowe a question. Here's what they asked him: Since 2022, most advanced economies have been  hiking interest rates in a similar pattern to fight inflation. Interest rate changes in foreign economies  such as the US have an important  impact on our inflation and exchange rates, so we wonder, how much of an  impact of decisions made by other  central banks have Australian  monetary policy? Here's Lowe's answer: \"All the central banks are raising rates, at least  most of them, for the same reason. Inflation is too high. \"First of all, because of COVID supply disruptions and because of brush's invasion of Ukraine and then, more recently,  because of strong growth in unit  labour costs, stronger as in wages, productivity and that is keeping  services price inflation. That is a common story across most of the  advanced economies, and that is why we are all raising rates. We are not raising rates here because the US is raising them. But we are raising  them because we are facing the same general economic situation as the  United States. So that is how it  works. There is a potential link  through what other central banks do through the exchange rates. If the US was to raise rates and we didn't, then the US dollar tends to  strengthen the Australian dollar  would appreciate and that would  bring Australia inflation. That  could influence our decisions. But it is very much at the margin. \"We  are raising rates because we need  to, because of our particular  circumstances, not because the US is.\"",
