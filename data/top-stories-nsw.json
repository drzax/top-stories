There was no Steph Catley (or Caitlin Foord) in the side that day and that meant Charlotte Grant was in the starting line-up at the back. After Sam Kerr slotted in the first half, 21-year-old Grant scored her first international goal to help end the Lionesses' 30-match unbeaten run. Grant hasn't had a run in this World Cup yet, with the Carpenter-Kennedy-Clare-Catley backline locked into place, but will she come on as some sort of anti-England specialist?",
