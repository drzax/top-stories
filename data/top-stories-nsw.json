                  "articleBody": "The local share market has begun its day sharply lower, after heavy losses on Wall Street overnight on worries about the stability of US regional banks and tomorrow's Federal Reserve rate hike. By 10:30am AEST, the benchmark ASX 200 was down 1.1% to 7,191 points, with eight out of every 10 stocks in the red (in other words, most of them). Energy was the worst peforming sector after a 5% plunge in oil prices overnight. It has led to steep falls in the share price of Santos (-2.8%), Karoon Energy (-2.9%), Woodside Energy (-3%) and Paladin Energy (-3.2%). On the flip side, today's best performing stocks are gold miners after a sharp rise in the precious metal's spot price. Gold stocks like De Grey Mining (+7.4%), Gold Road Resources (+6.9%), Silver Lake Resources (+5.9%) and Evolution Mining (+5.3%) are enjoying the largest gains."

Last month, the Ai Group Australian Industry Index dropped by 14 points to -20.1 points (seasonally adjusted). This is a deeply negative result, particularly given this index (which tracks industrial activity) has shrunk for 12 months in row. \"Australian industry marks a disappointing anniversary in April – 12 months of continuous contraction,\" said Innes Willox, the chief executive of Ai Group. \"Activity and sales have fallen into contraction as demand is weakening, a pattern now affecting every subsector within industry. \"Yet price pressures and shortages for supply chains and labour remain acute, trapping industry between supply constraints and falling demand. \"Yesterday's decision by the Reserve Bank to raise interest rates, while necessary to contain inflation, will add more pain to businesses facing a worsening economic outlook.\" The AiGroup noted that: \"All industrial subsectors are in contraction following      declines in April\". \"Manufacturing, chemicals, food & beverage and      business services reported steep falls.\""

                  "headline": "European shares close at one-month low",
                  "articleBody": "European markets also had a rough session overnight. The pan-European STOXX 600 index fell 1.2%, finishing at its worst level since early April. Oil and gas shares were some of the biggest drags on the market. They plunged 4.5%, roughly in line with plunging oil prices lower — on worries about a US bond default, weak economic data from China and expectations the US and Europe will raise interest rates again this week. Shares of BP dropped 8.6%, after the company pared a share buyback plan but made a $US5 billion profit in the first quarter of 2023. Investors were also refraining from risk-taking ahead of the US Federal Reserve's policy decision, that is likely to push the US central bank's benchmark overnight interest rate to its highest level in nearly 16 years. \"Nerves are rising about the debt ceiling standoff in the US, with the prospect that a default could shake the global economy, just as worries about further banking repercussions have been calmed for now,\" said Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown. ECB expected to slow down its rate hikes Markets also keenly awaited a rate decision by the European Central Bank (ECB) on Thursday evening (AEST), where it is widely seen hiking by 0.25 percentage points. Derivatives markets also see European rates peaking at around 3.7% in November. Boosting the case for a smaller interest-rate increase, data showed euro zone banks are turning off the credit taps and a key gauge of inflation is finally falling. \"The data are finally in and they suggest the ECB can slow down the pace of tightening from 50 to 25 bp [basis points]. That said, this does not need to be a dovish 25bp hike,\" said Davide Oneglia, senior economist at TS Lombard. \"The bigger question remains where the ECB will stop. The answer depends mostly on a mid-year US recession materialising and on the Fed response to it.\""

Spot gold jumped 1.5% to $US2,012 an ounce (its biggest daily rise in a month). The precious metal traded as high as $US2,019.37 overnight, its highest value since mid-April. \"The banking concerns are back... it's really removing that risk that the Fed was going to possibly be considering a June rate rise,\" said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at OANDA. Shares of US regional lenders plunged, while Treasury yields fell as the collapse of First Republic Bank triggered investor concerns about the health of other mid-sized lenders. While gold is considered a hedge against economic uncertainties, rising rates hurt demand for this zero-yielding asset. Gold has also been supported by some safe-haven demand from resurgent worries over the banking sector's health and US debt ceiling uncertainty, Bank of China International analyst Xiao Fu said. Spot silver rose 1.1% to $US25.25 per ounce. Platinum gained 1.2% to $US1,061.99. Palladium fell 1.5% to $US1,429.47."

                  "headline": "RBA delivers 'massive' hit to millions of Australians struggling with overwhelming cost pressures",
                  "articleBody": "The Reserve Bank's latest interest rate hike has increased the chance of Australia's economy suffering a \"hard landing\". Deloitte Access Economics has rebuked the RBA for playing \"recession roulette\", after the bank lifted rates to their highest level since April 2012. The NAB and AMP have both increased their probabilities of Australia slipping into a recession from 40 per cent to 45 per cent. AMP says a \"consumer recession\" (which, to many Australians, will feel like a recession, even if one is not technically reached) is now \" inevitable \"). Both chief economists Alan Oster and Shane Oliver said a technical recession — two consecutive quarters of negative economic growth — could be achieved with another interest rate increase.

                  "articleBody": "The Reserve Bank shocked most experts yesterday, when it decided to lift interest rates by another 0.25 percentage points. This brings its cash rate target to a 3.85% (a fresh 11-year high). However, the coup de grace was last week's inflation number for the March quarter. The RBA was spooked by an acceleration in price rises for services such as hospitality, healthcare and education. \"Looking overseas, we see worryingly persistent services price inflation,\" RBA governor Philip Lowe said. \"It is possible that circumstances might be different here in Australia, but the experience abroad points to an upside risk, especially given the high degree of commonality across countries in inflation dynamics recently.\" Life could become 'more difficult' It's a risk the RBA evidently did not want to take, deciding that another rate rise now might head off the need for even higher rates later. \"We are taking a bit more time than some other countries, on the basis that doing so can preserve some of the gains in the labour market,\" Mr Lowe explained. \"But there is a limit here. If we take too long to get inflation back to target, expectations will adjust and life will become more difficult.\" For more on this, here's the story by my colleague Michael Janda :"

                  "headline": "Oil prices sink 5% amid concerns about recession and US debt default",
                  "articleBody": "The price of crude oil plunged by around 5% to a five-week low as concerns about the US economy mount. Brent futures fell by $US3.99 (or 5%), to settle at $US75.32 a barrel. West Texas Intermediate crude (WTI) fell $US4 (or 5.3%), to end at $US71.66. That was the lowest close for both benchmarks since March 24 and was also their biggest one-day percentage declines since early January. Oil prices fell after US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said the government may be unable to meet all of its payment obligations by June 1 — without legislation to raise Washington's borrowing limit. The White House said President Joe Biden would not negotiate over the debt ceiling during his meeting with four top congressional leaders on May 9, but he will discuss starting \"a separate budget process.\" Recession risk The latest data showed that US job openings fell for a third straight month in March and layoffs increased to the highest level in more than two years. It suggests the job market is weakening, which could aid the Federal Reserve's fight against inflation. \"The US economy continues to evolve in a manner consistent with a recession commencing later this year,\" analysts at Barclays wrote in a note to clients. \"The manufacturing sector is contracting, the consumer is struggling ... [and] there are broadening signs of cracks emerging within the labor market.\" This week, investors will look for market direction from expected interest rate hikes by central banks still fighting inflation. More hikes could slow economic growth and reduce demand for energy (and oil). The US Federal Reserve is expected to increase interest rates by another 0.25 percentage points on Thursday morning (AEST). The European Central Bank is also expected to raise rates at its policy meeting on Thursday evening (AEST). \"Oil basically has weakening prospects from the world’s two largest economies, China and the US, and if the macro backdrop deteriorates momentum selling could easily send prices below the $US70 level,\" said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at OANDA. Over the weekend, data from China, the world's top crude importer, showed manufacturing activity fell unexpectedly in April. That was the first contraction in China's manufacturing purchasing managers' index since December."

                  "articleBody": "US markets closed sharply lower after regional bank stocks plunged on renewed fears about their ability to survive. The benchmark S & P 500 fell 1.2%, while the Nasdaq Composite and Dow Jones index dropped 1.1% each. Shares of small to mid-sized banks have extended yesterday's falls after the seizure and auction of First Republic Bank. Most of First Republic's assets were bought by JPMorgan Chase in a deal brokered by a regulator (the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp). Two other US regional banks (Signature Bank and Silicon Valley Bank) collapsed in March. \"There are concerns that this is not over, and that rates are going to (continue to) go up, and it could be a catalyst for more problems,\" said Quincy Krosby, chief global strategist at LPL Financial. \"There's more and more talk about problems with commercial real estate. Commercial real estate really is, for the most part, the province of the regional banks.\" Overnight, regional banks PacWest and Western Alliance plummeted 27% and 15%, respectively, while the KBW regional banking index fell to its lowest level intraday since late 2020. Jitters ahead of Fed decision Investors also adopted a \"risk off\" mentality as they tried to gauge how much longer the US Federal Reserve may need to hike interest rates. The US dollar index (which measures the greenback against a basket of major currencies) fell 0.2% to 101.93. The Fed is expected to lift rates by 0.25 percentage points on Thursday morning (AEST). Markets are anxious for any signals from the central bank on whether it will be the last hike for now, or if further increases are possible if inflation remains high. Meanwhile, energy shares dropped after oil prices plunged 5% as investors worried about a potential US debt default. The S & P 500 energy sector was down the most of any major sector, followed by S & P financials."

By 10:30am AEST, the benchmark ASX 200 was down 1.1% to 7,191 points, with eight out of every 10 stocks in the red (in other words, most of them). Energy was the worst peforming sector after a 5% plunge in oil prices overnight. It has led to steep falls in the share price of Santos (-2.8%), Karoon Energy (-2.9%), Woodside Energy (-3%) and Paladin Energy (-3.2%). On the flip side, today's best performing stocks are gold miners after a sharp rise in the precious metal's spot price. Gold stocks like De Grey Mining (+7.4%), Gold Road Resources (+6.9%), Silver Lake Resources (+5.9%) and Evolution Mining (+5.3%) are enjoying the largest gains.",

Last month, the Ai Group Australian Industry Index dropped by 14 points to -20.1 points (seasonally adjusted). This is a deeply negative result, particularly given this index (which tracks industrial activity) has shrunk for 12 months in row. \"Australian industry marks a disappointing anniversary in April – 12 months of continuous contraction,\" said Innes Willox, the chief executive of Ai Group. \"Activity and sales have fallen into contraction as demand is weakening, a pattern now affecting every subsector within industry. \"Yet price pressures and shortages for supply chains and labour remain acute, trapping industry between supply constraints and falling demand. \"Yesterday's decision by the Reserve Bank to raise interest rates, while necessary to contain inflation, will add more pain to businesses facing a worsening economic outlook.\" The AiGroup noted that: \"All industrial subsectors are in contraction following      declines in April\". \"Manufacturing, chemicals, food & beverage and      business services reported steep falls.\"",

                  "plaintext": "European markets also had a rough session overnight. The pan-European STOXX 600 index fell 1.2%, finishing at its worst level since early April. Oil and gas shares were some of the biggest drags on the market. They plunged 4.5%, roughly in line with plunging oil prices lower — on worries about a US bond default, weak economic data from China and expectations the US and Europe will raise interest rates again this week. Shares of BP dropped 8.6%, after the company pared a share buyback plan but made a $US5 billion profit in the first quarter of 2023. Investors were also refraining from risk-taking ahead of the US Federal Reserve's policy decision, that is likely to push the US central bank's benchmark overnight interest rate to its highest level in nearly 16 years. \"Nerves are rising about the debt ceiling standoff in the US, with the prospect that a default could shake the global economy, just as worries about further banking repercussions have been calmed for now,\" said Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown. ECB expected to slow down its rate hikes Markets also keenly awaited a rate decision by the European Central Bank (ECB) on Thursday evening (AEST), where it is widely seen hiking by 0.25 percentage points. Derivatives markets also see European rates peaking at around 3.7% in November. Boosting the case for a smaller interest-rate increase, data showed euro zone banks are turning off the credit taps and a key gauge of inflation is finally falling. \"The data are finally in and they suggest the ECB can slow down the pace of tightening from 50 to 25 bp [basis points]. That said, this does not need to be a dovish 25bp hike,\" said Davide Oneglia, senior economist at TS Lombard. \"The bigger question remains where the ECB will stop. The answer depends mostly on a mid-year US recession materialising and on the Fed response to it.\"",

Spot gold jumped 1.5% to $US2,012 an ounce (its biggest daily rise in a month). The precious metal traded as high as $US2,019.37 overnight, its highest value since mid-April. \"The banking concerns are back... it's really removing that risk that the Fed was going to possibly be considering a June rate rise,\" said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at OANDA. Shares of US regional lenders plunged, while Treasury yields fell as the collapse of First Republic Bank triggered investor concerns about the health of other mid-sized lenders. While gold is considered a hedge against economic uncertainties, rising rates hurt demand for this zero-yielding asset. Gold has also been supported by some safe-haven demand from resurgent worries over the banking sector's health and US debt ceiling uncertainty, Bank of China International analyst Xiao Fu said. Spot silver rose 1.1% to $US25.25 per ounce. Platinum gained 1.2% to $US1,061.99. Palladium fell 1.5% to $US1,429.47.",

Brent futures fell by $US3.99 (or 5%), to settle at $US75.32 a barrel. West Texas Intermediate crude (WTI) fell $US4 (or 5.3%), to end at $US71.66. That was the lowest close for both benchmarks since March 24 and was also their biggest one-day percentage declines since early January. Oil prices fell after US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said the government may be unable to meet all of its payment obligations by June 1 — without legislation to raise Washington's borrowing limit. The White House said President Joe Biden would not negotiate over the debt ceiling during his meeting with four top congressional leaders on May 9, but he will discuss starting \"a separate budget process.\" Recession risk The latest data showed that US job openings fell for a third straight month in March and layoffs increased to the highest level in more than two years. It suggests the job market is weakening, which could aid the Federal Reserve's fight against inflation. \"The US economy continues to evolve in a manner consistent with a recession commencing later this year,\" analysts at Barclays wrote in a note to clients. \"The manufacturing sector is contracting, the consumer is struggling ... [and] there are broadening signs of cracks emerging within the labor market.\" This week, investors will look for market direction from expected interest rate hikes by central banks still fighting inflation. More hikes could slow economic growth and reduce demand for energy (and oil). The US Federal Reserve is expected to increase interest rates by another 0.25 percentage points on Thursday morning (AEST). The European Central Bank is also expected to raise rates at its policy meeting on Thursday evening (AEST). \"Oil basically has weakening prospects from the world’s two largest economies, China and the US, and if the macro backdrop deteriorates momentum selling could easily send prices below the $US70 level,\" said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at OANDA. Over the weekend, data from China, the world's top crude importer, showed manufacturing activity fell unexpectedly in April. That was the first contraction in China's manufacturing purchasing managers' index since December.",

The benchmark S & P 500 fell 1.2%, while the Nasdaq Composite and Dow Jones index dropped 1.1% each. Shares of small to mid-sized banks have extended yesterday's falls after the seizure and auction of First Republic Bank. Most of First Republic's assets were bought by JPMorgan Chase in a deal brokered by a regulator (the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp). Two other US regional banks (Signature Bank and Silicon Valley Bank) collapsed in March. \"There are concerns that this is not over, and that rates are going to (continue to) go up, and it could be a catalyst for more problems,\" said Quincy Krosby, chief global strategist at LPL Financial. \"There's more and more talk about problems with commercial real estate. Commercial real estate really is, for the most part, the province of the regional banks.\" Overnight, regional banks PacWest and Western Alliance plummeted 27% and 15%, respectively, while the KBW regional banking index fell to its lowest level intraday since late 2020. Jitters ahead of Fed decision Investors also adopted a \"risk off\" mentality as they tried to gauge how much longer the US Federal Reserve may need to hike interest rates. The US dollar index (which measures the greenback against a basket of major currencies) fell 0.2% to 101.93. The Fed is expected to lift rates by 0.25 percentage points on Thursday morning (AEST). Markets are anxious for any signals from the central bank on whether it will be the last hike for now, or if further increases are possible if inflation remains high. Meanwhile, energy shares dropped after oil prices plunged 5% as investors worried about a potential US debt default. The S & P 500 energy sector was down the most of any major sector, followed by S & P financials.",

Last month, the Ai Group Australian Industry Index dropped by 14 points to -20.1 points (seasonally adjusted). This is a deeply negative result, particularly given this index (which tracks industrial activity) has shrunk for 12 months in row. \"Australian industry marks a disappointing anniversary in April – 12 months of continuous contraction,\" said Innes Willox, the chief executive of Ai Group. \"Activity and sales have fallen into contraction as demand is weakening, a pattern now affecting every subsector within industry. \"Yet price pressures and shortages for supply chains and labour remain acute, trapping industry between supply constraints and falling demand. \"Yesterday's decision by the Reserve Bank to raise interest rates, while necessary to contain inflation, will add more pain to businesses facing a worsening economic outlook.\" The AiGroup noted that: \"All industrial subsectors are in contraction following      declines in April\". \"Manufacturing, chemicals, food & beverage and      business services reported steep falls.\"",

Spot gold jumped 1.5% to $US2,012 an ounce (its biggest daily rise in a month). The precious metal traded as high as $US2,019.37 overnight, its highest value since mid-April. \"The banking concerns are back... it's really removing that risk that the Fed was going to possibly be considering a June rate rise,\" said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at OANDA. Shares of US regional lenders plunged, while Treasury yields fell as the collapse of First Republic Bank triggered investor concerns about the health of other mid-sized lenders. While gold is considered a hedge against economic uncertainties, rising rates hurt demand for this zero-yielding asset. Gold has also been supported by some safe-haven demand from resurgent worries over the banking sector's health and US debt ceiling uncertainty, Bank of China International analyst Xiao Fu said. Spot silver rose 1.1% to $US25.25 per ounce. Platinum gained 1.2% to $US1,061.99. Palladium fell 1.5% to $US1,429.47.",
