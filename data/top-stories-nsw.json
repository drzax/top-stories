But the Fair Work Commission (FWC) award wages decision does seem to have had some influence on the ASX. From an early high of 7,166 around 10:12am AEST, around the time the FWC handed down its wages determination, the ASX 200 index has steadily pared back its gains to 7,131 points. That is still up 0.3% on yesterday's close, but well off the S & P 500's 1% gain on Wall Street overnight. There are two reasons why a higher than expected award wage increase may have had this effect: It will push up costs for businesses who pay their employees award rates or whose enterprise agreements are benchmarked off the award. Some economists believe it will raise pressure on the Reserve Bank to raise interest rates again, possibly as soon as next week. That seems to be reflected in the sectors gaining and losing ground. Mining, utilities and energy are up — they are much more affected by global pricing forces, with wages a smaller share of costs and most of their workforces above award rates anyway. Consumer non-cyclicals (dominated by the big supermarkets), financials and healthcare are down. These are labour intensive sectors, with many employees either on award rates or on enterprise agreements that are not a huge amount above award rates, so many of these firms are likely to see their costs rise substantially as a result of today's decision.",
