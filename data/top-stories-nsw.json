Lewis Miller, who came on as a substitute last week, gets his first international start, while fellow full-back Jordan Bos starts ahead of Ryan Strain. And in great news for 2015 men's Asian Cup enthusiasts everywhere, we're about to see the glorious return of Massimo Luongo in midfield in place of Jackson Irvine. It's his first Socceroos start since 2019. As for New Zealand, there are four changes from their 1-1 draw against Congo last month, with an unfortunate last-minute calf strain to former Wellington Phoenix man Sarpreet Singh ruling him out of this game. Perhaps the most recognisable player is Nottingham Forest striker Chris Wood, who's been on a scoring tear recently and starts up front. What do you make of these changes, beloved blog-readers? Has Arnold made the right calls here? Who are you excited to see? Log in and tell me your predictions!",
