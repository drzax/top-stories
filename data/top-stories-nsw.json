Our North America bureau chief, Jade Macmillan told News Breakfast residents allege the company failed to shut off powerlines, despite warnings that strong winds could bring them down and spark fast moving fires. Here's what she told the show: \"Hawaiian Electric says that the cause of these fires still hasn't been determined, and that it will work with state and local officials as they investigate. But its share price has plummeted today amid these new questions in the aftermath of this tragedy. There is so much pain on Maui, but there's also growing frustration. People asking, for example, what caused these fires? People also still wondering — why residents in the worst affected areas weren't warned of the dangers sooner? Why the emergency sirens, for example, in particular areas, didn't go off? People also frustrated in some areas about the level of government assistance that is being provided. They are reporting a really remarkable effort by locals, by volunteers who are doing whatever they can to help one another out.\" She reported specialist teams with cadaver dogs are still making their way through what is left of Lahaina and the death toll is still expected to rise.",

People also still wondering — why residents in the worst affected areas weren't warned of the dangers sooner? Why the emergency sirens, for example, in particular areas, didn't go off? People also frustrated in some areas about the level of government assistance that is being provided. They are reporting a really remarkable effort by locals, by volunteers who are doing whatever they can to help one another out.\""

This is the latest on the Country Garden situation from Reuters : China's largest private real estate developer Country Garden is seeking to delay payment on a private onshore bond for the first time, the latest sign of a stifling cash crunch in the property sector, piling pressure on Beijing to step in. Adding to worries about contagion risk, a major Chinese trust company that traditionally had sizable exposure to real estate, Zhongrong International Trust Co, has missed its repayment obligations on some investment products. Analysts warned that a rise in default by trust companies, also known as shadow banks, which have strong ties to the domestic property sector, will further weigh on the world's second-largest economy. Those fears have seen BHP and Rio Tinto fall around 0.5% in early trade, after steeper drops yesterday. Fortescue Metals is holding up, however, rising 1.1%. Industrials, energy and mining were among the sectors slightly in the red on the ASX 200 today, but big gains in healthcare and solid rises for tech, real estate and financials more than offset those losses. There are 109 companies on the up, compared to only 72 of the top 200 on the slide. The ASX 200 is up 0.3% to 7,300 points in the first 20 minutes of trade. The Aussie dollar has also stabilised, sitting at 64.89 US cents .",

It has reported a 3.3% decline in net profit after tax to $254.5 million on a 2.2% fall in sales revenue. However, its earnings before tax, interest and material one-offs climbed 11.4% to $583.5 million, with underlying net profit (excluding those one-offs) rising 16.6% to $376.1 million. The company says its strategy of \"premiumisation\" is working to improve profit margins on the wine it is selling, with its margin jumping 2.9 percentage points to 24.1%. It is targeting a margin of around 25%. TWE said demand for its luxury and premium wines remains solid, especially its flagship Penfolds brand, which saw both sales and profits rise more than 14%. The company says it expects demand for its luxury wines to continue being strong, while premium wine demand is expected to remain \"consistent\". However, \"commercial\" wine demand is expected to \"remain challenged\" with TWE predicting further volume decreases for the mass market segment. The company has declared a final dividend of 17 cents per share, which leaves the full-year payout for shareholders at 35 cents per share.",
