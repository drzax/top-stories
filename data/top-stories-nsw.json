Egypt's president again rejected any talk of driving Gaza's 2.3 million Palestinians into the Sinai Peninsula and warned against the \"liquidation of the Palestinian cause\". Jordan's King Abdullah II called Israel's siege and bombardment of Gaza \"a war crime\". The speeches reflected growing anger in the region, even among those with close ties to Israel who have often worked as mediators, as the war sparked by a massive Hamas attack enters a third week with casualties mounting and no end in sight. Egypt is especially concerned about a massive influx of Palestinians crossing into its territory, something that it fears would, among other things, severely undermine hopes for a Palestinian state.
