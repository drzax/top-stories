Tabcorp will pay around $37 million to The Lottery Corporation (TLC) as part of a separation deed between the two companies, dated March 25 last year.

It's been a week since the Aussie dollar was above that 64 US cent mark, and although it's edging slightly higher, it hasn't cracked the 65 US cent mark since mid-August. So what's behind today's increase? A stronger Japanese yen, in response to comments by the Bank of Japan's governor Kazuo Ueda, who flagged Japan could soon have enough data to end negative interest rates. That bounce has also been helped by China's consumer prices returning to positive territory, rising by 0.1% in August from a year earlier, which is a sign the economy might be stabilising with an easing of deflationary pressures. But investors are still nervous about the US inflation data coming out later this week (Wednesday, to be precise), and whether the Federal Reserve is finished with rate hikes or more may be on the horizon — which will then ripple through the global economy.",
