The first is the bank's \"Wellbeing Index\", which rose very slightly in the September quarter, albeit from a two-year low. It is still below average levels, with anxiety on the rise but measures of financial stress falling for the first time in six quarters. \"Though Australians are clearly being stretched financially, many appear to be growing more accustomed to these pressures, having made deliberate spending trade-offs to manage household balance sheets and support their lifestyle in the face of inflation and higher rates,\" the report noted. For the month of September, these trade offs don't appear to have included a massive reduction in retail spending. NAB's monthly online retail sales index, which rebounded with a 2.9% jump in September after a 1.1% fall in August, with online retail spending now up 11% over the year to September. Of course, inflation has accounted for around half of that growth, with average consumer prices up 5.4% over that same period. Nonetheless, NAB's chief economist Alan Oster says it's another indication of Australians' overall financial resilience in the face of big interest rate hikes. \"The growth for the largest sales category, homewares and appliances, was enough to lift year-on-year growth back to positive territory, which had been negative for over a year,\" he observed. \"For the broader online series, and other categories, the improvement in year-on-year growth has been underway since May.\" But NAB's wellbeing survey again highlights that some groups are feeling the financial strain a lot more than others. \"Around 6 in 10 (57%) Australians identified living costs as the biggest cause of their stress (down slightly from 61% in Q2), still well ahead of personal financial issues, health (both physical and mental), housing costs and the economy. \"Concerns around living and housing costs are most pronounced for Australians aged 30-49 and those on lower incomes.\"",

Even before this data, he said the RBA meeting next Tuesday was \"live\". \"We now put the probability of a 25bp rate increase on Melbourne Cup day at 70%,\" he says. His bet is the cash rate going up to 4.35 per cent, then staying at that level. Now he has given more detail on when he thinks the easing off by the RBA will begin. Aird reckons the cash rate will stay at 4.35 per cent until at least mid-2024 or Q3. \"There are many components of the CPI basket that are running hot, but are largely beyond the control of the RBA,\" he says. \"In particular, strong price rises for petrol, rent and utilities cannot be muted by a higher cash rate.\" Meanwhile, NAB has just upped its variable loan interest rate, indicating it thinks higher rates will be around for longer. Aaaaand ANZ has also just put out a note where it backs the CBA bet for a 0.25 hike on Melbourne Cup. \"We think the RBA will only tighten once in response to the Q3 CPI, although it will retain a tightening bias and the risk of additional hikes is real,\" they noted. Of course, it'll all come down to the RBA. Its governor Michele Bullock noted this week that the inflation data didn't come at much a surprise to the RBA. \"We viewed the Governor’s testimony to the Senate on Thursday as an exercise in not being drawn on the implications of the CPI ahead of the November Board meeting,\" ANZ says. \"While markets might have pared back expectations of a rate hike in November on that testimony, we think the full context of the Governor's responses ... left a rate hike more likely than not.\" We'll see on Cup Day...",

In response, Wall Street... dropped significantly. As it stands, it looks like the S & P 500 is headed for quite a correction. Showing you that good news is sometimes bad news. It appears investors think this latest set of strong economic data means the Fed will keep hiking rates. On the flip side, 10 year Treasury yields have dropped marginally. So who really knows? Over in Europe, the ECB has kept rates on hold for the first time in 10 months. That was widely expected and the markets didn't really react that much. The central bank's statement also all but confirmed that's the end of their tightening cycle, with economic conditions there remaining weak. And here in Australia, we are headed for a subdued open. We've had a lot of appearances by the RBA this week. Here is Nassim Khadem's wrap of their new governor in front of Senate Estimates yesterday. Grab a cup of coffee. It's Friday!",
