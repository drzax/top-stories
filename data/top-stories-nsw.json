He continued to say, \"Now in the UK about 15 per cent are variable, everyone else is on fixed rates because people were trying to protect themselves during the crisis.\" Here in Australia Mr Lloyd Cape said about 80 per cent of home loans are variable. He added fixed mortgage rates are lower in the UK, because there are more banks, so more competition. \"They have competition driving them to provide something that is a much safer, more effective product for consumers.\" He was making the point in Per Capita's argument for better competition laws in Australia.",

The Fair Work Commission (FWC) recommended an increase in certain allowances for employees, and said a committee would be set up to work over the next three months to list the skills required for staff to become eligible for promotions. Employees should also be paid to travel to attend training sessions, and Chevron must pay for their flights and accommodation if required, the commission said. Commissioner Bernie Riordan said \"I strongly recommend that the parties adopt the recommendations … which will hopefully resolve these disputes.\" \"In my view, the parties are close to achieving their desired outcome of registered enterprise agreements to cover the wages and employment conditions,\" Riordan said in the filing. \"It would be a pity and very frustrating to simply throw out these agreed positions and have the parties return to their respective logs of claims for any future arbitration.\" Chevron and the unions said they would review the recommendations. The two sides have until 9am AEST on Friday to decide whether to accept the commission's recommendations.",
