Staff who experienced bullying, racism or sexual harassment over the last five years were less likely to have confidence in making a report or a complaint. \"Many people have experienced retribution, particularly loss of access to advancement opportunities, when they have either formally or informally reported harmful experiences,\" the report found.

The report comes as the big four accounting firms face an existential crisis after Pwc leaked confidential government tax plans to help their multinational clients pay less tax.

More than 4,500 current and former employees were surveyed across Australia and New Zealand. EY says it has already put in place measures to support well being and workplace culture including mental health first aid staff and welfare contact officers. The report found that many of the problems identified are known challenges across professional services firms in Australia, particularly overwork. EY Oceania chief executive David Larocca says the firm has fallen short of the standard that everyone who works at EY has a right to expect. “There are findings in the report that are distressing and completely unacceptable. Bullying, sexual harassment and racism have no place at EY Oceania and I apologise to anyone who has suffered as a result.” \" The impact of long working hours is also significant and taking a heavy toll on the well being of many of our people.”",
