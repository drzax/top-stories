This award demonstrates that we are on the right track. \"We will continue to strive for our children and families. We need to invest into our future for our children; let's not waste their first six years, let's build on the strength and depth of our histories and belonging. \"In the words of the great doctor Bruce McGuinness, he said, 'give us your today and we will give you our tomorrow'.\" Truth-telling underpins the learning curriculum at Bubup Wilam Aboriginal Child and Family Centre. The centre services Aboriginal children aged to five, with its name meaning 'Childrens' Place' in the Woi Wurrung language. Their approach to learning on country empowers young Aboriginal children to develop strong connections with their identity and their culture. Bubup Wilam Aboriginal Child and Family Centre is also one of three service providers in Australia to offer a one-stop shop for allied health services like: hearing tests, speech pathologists, general check-ups without fear, shame, racism.",

Instead, she blazed a trail of her own, truth-telling the history of Australia that many Australians didn't hear at school, through her award-winning films and TV programs. Much of the Arrernte and Kalkadoon writer, producer and director's career, spans over 30 years, unearthing Australia's history through the eyes and voices of First Nations people. Her seven-part series, First Australians, received notable industry awards including the UN Media Peace Prize, TV Week Logie Award and an Australian Writers and Directors Guild Award. Not only was it Australia's bestselling educational title, but it sold out across the world. When accepting the Creative Talent award, Perkins paid tribute to Indigenous Australians Minister Linda Burney and last year's Lifetime Achievement award-winner Pat Anderson. \"These two women are leading us with the Uluru Statement from the Heart, and we're taking Australia on a journey to 'Yes' this year — stand with us, Australia,\" she said.
