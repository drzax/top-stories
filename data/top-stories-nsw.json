Stefanie Lambert Junttila, who along with other Trump allies tried to reverse Trump's defeat to US President Joe Biden in Michigan, was charged with accessing, tampering with and undue possession of voting machines in the state. Ms Lambert is the third person charged in Michigan this week after a special prosecutor in that state reviewed allegations that Trump allies illegally accessed voting machines after the 2020 election. Two other Republicans, former Michigan attorney general candidate Matt DePerno, and Daire Rendon, a former state representative, made their initial court appearances on Tuesday in connection with the case. All three were named last year by the state's attorney general in an investigation of a scheme to access voting tabulators.",

As The Associated Press reports, officials at a news conference in San Diego declined to specify whether the sailors were aware of each other's actions. But they did say cases exemplify China's brazenness in trying to obtain insight into US military operations. \"Through the alleged crimes committed by these defendants, sensitive military information ended up in the hands of the People's Republic of China,\" US Attorney Randy Grossman says. The arrested sailors are Jinchao Wei, a 22-year-old born in China, who was allegedly approached by a Chinese intelligence officer while he was applying to become a naturalised US citizen. The other is sailor Wenheng Zhao, 26, who officials allege conspired to collect bribes from a Chinese intelligence officer in exchange for US naval exercise plans, operational orders and photos and videos of electrical systems.",

The RBA's quarterly Statement on Monetary Policy will be released at 11:30am AEST, after the central bank left rates on hold on Tuesday. It will contain the latest economic forecasts. In Tuesday's post-meeting statement, governor Philip Lowe said inflation was expected to be around 3.25 per cent by the end of next year, and back between 2-3 per cent by late 2025. NAB's head of FX strategy Ray Attrill notes that the forecasts will be based on the assumed path of the cash rate prior to the August meeting, based on economist forecasts and market pricing — \"the former encompassing a consensus view for at least one more rate rise in the cycle and the latter the best part of one.\" Since Tuesday, a number of economists have changed their forecasts — CBA and Westpac now say the cash rate has peaked at 4.1 per cent, while ANZ has maintained that call as well.",

ASX futures are pointing slightly lower at the moment, so we could see local stocks dip at the open. That's after overseas markets ended in the red. In the US, earnings season continued with some upside surprises for technology names. Amazon shares have surged in after-hours trading, after reporting higher-than-expected profit and sales. Growth in its cloud computing division Amazon Web Services improved after slowing in recent quarters. Apple's profit also beat Wall Street forecasts, but iPhone sales missed expectations. And the Australian-founded software firm Atlassian's revenue came in ahead of estimates, sending its shares up in extended trade.
