When quizzed on the 11 MPs which voted against the expulsion motion, he said the overall vote reflected a strong endorsement of a \"very challenging\" decision. \"When any party has to deal with any kind of question of expulsion or suspension is not easy for members, and people can fall on either side of the line,\" Mr Pesutto said. \"But here, as a team, we understood how important it was to make a strong standing, and the party room did that.\" He reiterated the vote was a matter of unity, rather than individual viewpoints. \"What has happened today and in recent weeks has nothing to do with whether somebody is conservative or progressive,\" he said. \"I'm very comfortable with a diversity of viewpoints because I know that the Liberal Party is at its best when that diversity is respected and upheld.\"",

The benchmark ASX 200 index was down 0.2% at 7,240 points at 12:33pm AEST, while the broader All Ords was also off 0.2% at 7,436. As in early trade, it is the resources sector letting down the market, with both miners and energy companies losing ground. Basic materials (mostly mining) was down 1.4% and energy was off 1.2%. Every other sector was up, but this is Australia, and half of our corporate profits come from resource extraction, so where the miners go, often the market goes. Education and healthcare were still the biggest gainers. The best performers around 12:35pm were: Lake Resources: +8.7% to $0.625 Graincorp: +5.3% to $8.225 BrainChip Holdings: +4.6% to $0.46 News Corp: +4.5% to $25.92 Nanosonics: +2.8% to $5.55 The worst performers were: Sandfire Resources: -6% to $6.11 Regis Resources: -5.4% to $2.035 Evolution Mining: -5% to $3.685 West African Resources: -4.1% to $0.935 De Grey Mining: -3.9% to $1.4325",

              "plaintext": "As indicated by the futures market, it's a pretty flat start to trade on the ASX. The ASX 200 was up 1 point at 7,253 around 10:15am AEST — that's point, not per cent — and the All Ords was down 2 points at 7,448. Most companies in the top 200 were doing well, with 131 in the black and only 65 in the red. But the mining sector, notably the big iron ore miners, were among those losing ground, weighing on the index as a whole. BHP (-1.7%), Rio Tinto (-1.4%) and Fortescue (-1.6%) were all down after spot iron ore prices dropped below $US100 a tonne, continuing recent trends on signs of Chinese economic weakness. QBE was another big company dragging on the market — investors clearly not impressed with its first quarter performance update, despite 11% growth in gross written premium. The company did warn about the cost of a number of natural disasters, which is already creeping towards its first half catastrophe allowance with a couple of months yet to go. QBE shares were down 5.1 per cent to $14.39. Healthcare, education and consumer cyclicals were today's leading sectors, with energy joining mining as the laggards. The big four banks were up between 0.2 and 1 per cent, with Westpac leading. Five biggest gains on ASX 200: News Corp: +4.1% to $25.81 GrainCorp: +2.6% to $8.015 Sayona Mining: +2.4% to $0.215 Imugene: +2.1% to $0.1225 Polynovo: +1.6% to $1.4125 Five biggest losses on ASX 200: Sandfire Resources: -5.2% to $6.16 QBE Insurance: -4.8% to $14.43 Champion Iron: -3.7% to $6.20 Regis Resources: -3.7% to $2.07 Paladin Energy: -3.7% to $0.66",
