Israel's Channel 12 and other news outlets reported that Mr Netanyahu said there may be a need to examine whether months of protests against his government, including by reservists who said they would no longer report for regular duty, added to Hamas' motivation to carry out the October 7 rampage through southern Israel that triggered the current war. Benny Gantz, who joined Netanyahu's war cabinet from the opposition as part of an emergency government, said Mr Netanyahu must retract his comment. \"Avoiding responsibility and slinging mud at the time of war is a blow to the country,\" Mr Gantz wrote on social media platform X. After the public backlash, Mr Netanyahu posted on X that Hamas started a war \"because it wants to kill us all and not because of any argument within us .\" On Saturday, protesters gathered outside Netanyahu's residence, chanting \"Jail Now!\" in a public display of anger at the failures that led to the arrack. The protest, which coincided with a poll showing more than three-quarters of Israelis believe Mr Netanyahu should resign, underlined the growing public fury at their political and security leaders.",

CEO Peter King said the bank had only seen a modest rise in hardship and arrears, which were about half the level seen at the peak of the COVID pandemic. \"We are supporting customers who are doing it tough and ended the year with just over 13,000 customers in hardship arrangements,\" he told analysts and reporters. \"This is still lower than the peak we supported during COVID, which is a positive indicator that customers are mostly adapting to the environment.\" Westpac data show 40% of its mortgage customers are less than a month ahead in their repayments, while roughly 1.5% are already at least 30 days behind. When asked by me whether the bank had done any internal modelling on how many customers might fall behind if rates remain around current levels to the end of next year, Mr King instead addressed the 40% figure. \"The figure that you refer to there actually includes, say, interest-only loans, where a lot of people don't want to pay ahead because of tax benefits, fixed rates, as well as those that are new loans, which typically aren't ahead because they haven't had the opportunity to to get ahead yet. \"But I think the bigger point is the trend hasn't changed that much. So, that's why we say most customers are adapting to the environment.\" Separately, Mr King also revealed that the mortgage market had become less competitive, as the big banks try to restore their profit margins, which had been under pressure in the first half of the financial year. \"Competition in home lending was fierce during the first half of the year with intensity easing in the second half,\" he commented. \" Actions were taken to restore the front book profitability by reducing discounts. \"We were also later than some peers to remove or reduce cash-backs.\"",

The benchmark ASX 200 index is 0.3% higher at 7,000 points, bang in line with where the futures were trading this morning. Healthcare continues to lead gains, although Resmed (+3.5%) has pulled ahead of CSL (+1.4%) as the preferred stock in the sector. Aged care operator Regis Healthcare is the absolute standout, up more than 5% to $2.70. The big banks are all doing well on the back of Westpac's 26% surge in full-year profit, with investors no doubt hoping for similar returns from the other two big banks soon to report — ANZ and NAB. Westpac itself surged 3.6% to $22.27 after also announcing a $1.5 billion share buyback. I listened in to the bank's analyst/media briefing and will have a post on some highlights from that shortly. Elsewhere on the market, gold miners were popular, filling up much of the top movers list. But while precious metals were in vogue, base ones were just that today, with big operators like BHP (-1.1%), Rio Tinto (-1.1%) and South32 (-1.8%) all down. Biggest gains: Iress Ltd +8.3% to $5.64 De Grey Mining +6.3% to $1.2175 Evolution Mining +6% to $3.72 Star Entertainment Group +4.9% to $0.5875 Genesis Minerals +4.7% to $1.5125 Biggest losses: Block -5.1% to $77.05 Paladin Energy -5% to $0.955 Coronado Global Resources -3% to $1.7025 Computershare -2.3% to $24.55 Karoon Energy -2.2% to $2.465",
