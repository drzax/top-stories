They say they'll take the question on notice, and cite confidentiality obligations to their clients. Senator Henderson points to a figure in the business case referring to $205 million to $215 million to be provided by the federal government. YATES: That was an assumption that was directly given to us (by the Department of Jobs, Precincts and Regions). HENDERSON: Did the assumption have any basis of fact? YATES: Well, you'd have to ask the department what was the basis of its information … HENDERSON: Well hang on a minute … you're the one preparing the business case, don't you scrutinise the assumptions to be given? Do you ask the question 'was this a committed amount' or 'on what basis are we assuming that we will receive $205 million as a worst case and $215 million as a best case from the federal government?' YATES: That assumption was an assumption that was given to us. HENDERSON: You just take that at face value? You don't query it, you don't question it, you don't say well what's the basis for it? WALKER: We can't answer that question because to do so we might reveal information that's part of cabinet in-confidence. HENDERSON: Oh that's just rubbish! … That is just an absolute cop out.

PHILLIPS: I think for us it's probably a constant battle … in terms of the Commonwealth Games and something we need to work on is that perception of the games. Mr Phillips pointed forward to Gold Coast mayor Tom Tate's appearance in the afternoon, saying he hoped the benefits would be outlined during his evidence. Senator Colbeck said the last three games had all provided an economic benefit and asked whether Alberta, Canada's reference to costs in not bidding for 2030 damaged the image of the Commonwealth Games. \"I think it certainly makes our life difficult ,\" Mr Phillips said. He said Commonwealth Games Australia has to continue to push the cost-benefit ratio, not just the costs. Reporting by Melissa Brown",
