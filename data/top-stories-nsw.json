The lawsuit also argues the ban is pre-empted by federal law because it intrudes upon matters of federal concern. TikTok also argues Montana is trying to \"banish\" the app \"based on speculative concerns about TikTok's data security and content moderation practices\". Former US president Donald Trump tried to bar new downloads of TikTok and Chinese-owned WeChat and other transactions in 2020, which the companies said would have effectively barred use of the apps, but a series of court decisions blocked the bans from taking effect.",

Officials, players and former players showed solidarity with Vinícius, who on Sunday considered leaving the field after facing racist taunts from fans during Real Madrid's 1-0 loss at Valencia in the Spanish league. Valencia says it banned one of its fans for life and is looking to identify others who may have insulted Vinícius. Real Madrid says it has asked authorities to investigate the abusive behavior, saying the club believed the incident to be a hate crime. \"Real Madrid strongly condemns the events that took place yesterday (Sunday) against our player,\" the club says. \"These events represent a direct attack on the social and democratic model of coexistence of our State based on the rule of law.\" The president of Spain's soccer federation acknowledgs that the country has a racism problem. \"We have a problem of behavior, of education, of racism,\" Spanish soccer federation president Luis Rubiales says. \"And as long as there is one fan or one group of fans making insults based on someone's sexual orientation or skin color or belief, then we have a serious problem. A serious problem that stains an entire team, an entire fan base and an entire country.\" The Brazilian government has summoned the Spanish ambassador to explain the incident, and its foreign ministry says that after \"yet another inadmissible episode\" it believes effective measures have not been taken by the Spanish authorities to prevent such acts of racism.",
