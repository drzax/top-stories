Disney CEO Bob Iger was discussing the entertainment giant's quarterly results overnight, and announced that it would be hiking the price of its ad-free tier of the Disney+ streaming service by 27% — taking it to $US13.99 a month for those in the US. The price increase will take effect in the US from October 12, and is planning to roll out the higher subscription payments to its European customers from December. Meanwhile Disney is also going to introduce lower cost, ad-supported streaming plans to Canada, the UK and other European markets from November 1 at a lower price point. Cracking down on password-sharin g is also firmly in Disney's sights, with Iger saying they plan to roll out a strategy similar to what Netflix has recently unveiled \"sometime in 2024\". Right now Disney hasn't said whether the price increase will affect those of us here in Australia — but given the increases we've seen with other streaming services like Netflix and Spotify, it seems to be a matter of when it affects us, not if .",

ANZ monitors the spending made through its cards and merchant payment facilities (i.e. point-of-sale terminals) to get a near-real time pulse on consumer spending. There isn't much of one. Over the week to August 5, spending dived 8% compared with the same period a year earlier. Considering how much prices have risen for most things over that year, that is a huge fall in the volume of goods and services being purchased. As you can see, Aussies cut spending on almost everything, even staples like groceries. The only sector going up was entertainment, driven by a 95% jump in cinema spending as the Barbie movie and Oppenheimer opened at the same time, the so-called \"Barbenheimer\" effect. We're not even going out for meals or drinks anymore, with dining-out spending now below pre-pandemic levels in 2019. \"The ongoing softness in ANZ-observed spending, alongside the weak ABS household spending indicator and negative retail volumes print, suggests the RBA's efforts to curb spending are working,\" note ANZ economists Madeline Dunk and Adelaide Timbrell. \"Many households are facing a cashflow squeeze and are adjusting by curbing spending.\"",

In a segment of the Kyle and Jackie O program broadcast in August 2022, the controversial Sydney media personality \"stereotyped gay men as irresponsible in regard to their sexual health\", the Australian Communications and Media Authority ruled. It says Sandilands painted them as prime carriers of a virus that presented a danger to the community and did not deserve any sympathy or compassion. The 2022 outbreak of the virus formerly known as monkeypox, which caused more than 140 confirmed cases, was declared a communicable disease incident of national significance by the chief medical officer. ACMA chair Nerida O'Loughlin says Sandilands's comments were derisive and insulting and breached standards of decency expected by the public. \"Although there was a basis at the time for a public discussion about mpox that involved reference to gay sexuality, the segment went beyond any acceptable standards by conveying that gay men were irresponsible, were a risk to the community and did not deserve any sympathy even when presenting for medical assistance,\" she says. In a submission to the investigation, broadcaster KIIS 106.5 argued the segment was intended to bring about awareness to the community of the public health risk of mpox, but conceded it contained \"some unfavourable descriptions of those susceptible to the virus, being homosexual males\".
