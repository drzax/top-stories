CFA Incident Controller Andy Gillham says it's expected to reach the coastal town amid changing wind gusts this afternoon. \"That fire has now changed direction and is moving in an easterly direction and is expected to continue to move east this afternoon towards the township of Loch Sport,\" he says. \"We've asked people in Loch Sport this morning to stay where they are and shelter ... or move to a safe area.\" He says there's only one road in and out of Loch Sport which has been affected by fire. There is a temporary relief centre set up at the Loch Sport Marina. \"If there are going to be impacts on Loch Sport, we expect the impacts to be on the immediate western end of town, and we've got lots of appliances from CFA and FRV and other agencies there to minimise any impact,\" Gillham says. \"There's a very narrow strip of vegetation that lies between the main road and the lake itself, and there is potential for the fire to move right along that strip and it'll come very close to those backyards of those homes that lie on that strip.\" He says authorities are not expecting significant impacts but they want the community to be alert. Conditions are expected to ease after the cool change at around 5pm AEDT.",
