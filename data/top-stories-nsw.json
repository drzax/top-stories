It was here following a constitutional convention in 2017 that Indigenous leaders from around the country first called for an enshrined Indigenous Voice to Parliament to overcome enduring disempowerment and disadvantage. In this remote corner of the Northern Territory, the health, employment and educations gaps felt in Aboriginal communities are evident. Anthony Albanese met with some of the senior Aṉangu people who helped design the Uluṟu Statement from the Heart.

The late Gumatj clan leader and former Australian of the Year passed away earlier this year at age 74. Mr Dutton was speaking at a press conference in Adelaide, where he made a link between Yunupiŋu's achievements in helping improve economic outcomes for his Yolŋu people, and how that was a reason Australia should vote against the \"Canberra-based bureaucracy\" of an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Voice to Parliament. Indigenous Australians Minister Linda Burney called for Mr Dutton to apologise, accusing him of using the late leader's \"name in vain\" and of making inaccurate references to East Arnhem Land. Yunupiŋu's brother and now-leader of the Gumatj clan Djawa Yunupiŋu released a short statement in relation to Mr Dutton's comments, via the Yothu Yindi Foundation. \"It saddens our family to see my brother's name and legacy twisted like this,\" Mr Yunupiŋu said. \"He was a strong advocate for the Voice, and Mr Dutton knows that. \"He heard the same message loud and clear when he met with the 13-clan leadership of the Dilak Council, who also support a Voice.\" Djawa Yunupiŋu and the Dilak Council offered their unequivocal support towards a Voice to Parliament at the Garma Festival in north-east Arnhem Land earlier this year. Mr Dutton has been approached for further comment. NOTE: Yunupiŋu's surname and image are used in accordance with the wishes of his family.",

Institutional Shareholder Services' Vas Kolesnikoff says major shareholders welcome the announcement as the beginning of a greater board refresh. Emilia Terzon looks at the challenges of driving EVs in the outback (bringing new meaning to range anxiety). And the IMF warns global growth could take a 0.6% hit if Beijing fails to take forceful action over debt in China's property sector. Shaun Rein from China's Market Research Group tells the program consumer confidence is plummeting, and is now worse than during the height of China's COVID lockdowns.
