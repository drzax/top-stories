              "plaintext": "Workers at Chevron's Wheatstone and Gorgon liquefied natural gas (LNG) plants in Western Australia were set to begin rolling strike action today. They started downing tools at the plants for a few hours at a time last week, but from today are protected to stop work for 24 hours, for two weeks. Workers can determine how long they stop work for during each 24 hour period. Australia is the world's largest exporter of LNG - we mostly supply Asia. In fact 16 per cent of Japan's energy comes from these projects. Since talks of industrial action by the 500 workers began last month, the price of spot LNG in Europe has been particularly volatile. If the strike action is prolonged and supply is constrained, it could see prices jump even higher. Research group EnergyQuest estimates the strike action could cost Chevron up to $76m in lost revenue a day. The workers are campaigning for better rostering (they currently do two weeks straight of 12 hour days, then fly home for two week's off), more transparency about job titles and descriptions, less reliance on a labour hire workforce and better pay. Chevron and the union, Offshore Alliance, have been unable to reach an agreement and are before the Fair Work Commission. Chevron is pursuing an untested legal strategy to resolve the dispute and has applied to the Fair Work Commission with a hearing for that set down for September 22. The stop work action is likely to continue until then, however both parts have been instructed to keep negotiating.",

The Gorgon and Wheatstone plants in the state's north have the capacity to separate supply and send it south to Perth and customers through the state, both residential and commercial. The workers have given an undertaking that through their protected industrial action they will continue to ensure LNG flows to domestic customers.

The WA government has so far stayed clear of weighing in on the Chevron worker dispute, saying it is for the Fair Work Commission to oversee. However, it has stated, should supply become constrained, it has levers it can pull to ensure households are not without energy. This dispute could have a way to run.

Economist Adam Boyton says this is a more mixed labour force survey than the headline 64.9k gain in employment suggests. \"In particular, the unemployment rate holding at 3.7%, the vast bulk of jobs growth being part time, and hours worked falling in the month takes the gloss off the impressive headline jobs print. So despite the jump in headline employment we are left thinking the August labour force survey in its entirety isn't too different from our broad expectations. Yes, the labour market is still very solid but slack is creeping in (witness the increase in the underemployment rate to 6.6% in August from 6.4% in July).\" He note, in the past six months employment has risen by an average of 37.8k a month, that's well below the rate of population growth. Part-time employment increased 62.1k, while full-time rose 2.8k in the month. ANZ thinks the Reserve Bank won't change the cash rate \"for quite some time\".",
