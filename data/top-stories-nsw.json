Confidence edged up as sentiment around current and future economic conditions rose, as well as views on whether it's a good time to buy a major household item. ANZ senior economist Adelaide Timbrell noted that it was the sixth-straight week that consumer confidence remained within a narrow band. \"Retail sales data for July and ANZ-observed spending in August were also weak. \"The confidence impact of falling real wages due to inflation continues to offset the positives in the economy and is likely the main factor that has kept the index in very weak territory for the past six months,\" Ms Timbrell wrote. \"The resilient labour market and the beginning of what we think will be an extended pause from the RBA is yet to result in a confidence level above 80, which was achieved even during Delta lockdowns in 2021.\"",

Virgin, which has a partnership with Qatar, has been critical of the federal government's decision to block extra flights into Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane by the international carrier. Qantas boss Alan Joyce was questioned by senators yesterday over the airline's lobbying of the government on the issue and why it was in the national interest, as politicians and Mr Joyce have argued. Speaking on RN Breakfast this morning, Ms Hrdlicka disputed the national interest argument. \"I would just encourage the government to step back and say, let's get all the facts on the table and understand what's actually in the national interest. \"There's over $500 million in economic interest at stake here for the tourism industry — that's a lot of jobs.\" Ms Hrdlicka wants the government to reopen the decision and says Virgin has sought meetings with the prime minister but hasn't heard back. \"The statistics say that two-thirds of the seats that were flying in and out of Australia pre-COVID are back and a third of those seats are not back yet. \"So if we get those seats back, airfares will be as low as they possibly can be.\" Yesterday, the Qantas chief executive argued that capacity was already increasing, with additional flights added by Singapore Airlines and China Southern.
