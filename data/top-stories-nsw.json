              "plaintext": "An Israeli government ministry has drafted a wartime proposal to transfer the Gaza Strip's 2.3 million people to Egypt's Sinai Peninsula, drawing condemnation from the Palestinians and worsening tensions with Cairo. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office played down the report compiled by the Intelligence Ministry as a hypothetical exercise — a \"concept paper\". The document is dated October 13 and was first published by Sicha Mekomit, a local news site. In its report, the Intelligence Ministry — a junior ministry that conducts research but does not set policy — offered three alternatives \"to effect a significant change in the civilian reality in the Gaza Strip in light of the Hamas crimes that led to the Sword of Iron war\". The document's authors deem this alternative to be the most desirable for Israel's security. The document proposes moving Gaza's civilian population to tent cities in northern Sinai, then building permanent cities and an undefined humanitarian corridor. A security zone would be established inside Israel to block the displaced Palestinians from entering. The report did not say what would become of Gaza once its population is cleared out. AP",

The Offshore Alliance is an alliance between The Australian Workers' Union (AWU) and the Maritime Union of Australia (MUA). It says the agreements deliver members secure jobs, fixed rosters, career progression and significant improvements in pay and conditions of employment. For Gorgon and Wheatstone Downstream, the Offshore Alliance was negotiating on behalf of its members with Chevron since the start of 2023, and since mid-2022 for its members at the Wheatstone Platform. AWU WA secretary Brad Gandy says Offshore Alliance members at Chevron never blinked during negotiations. \"Subjective behavioural standards, which have previously prevented members progressing through the classification structure, are gone. Career progression will now be competency based,\" he said in a statement. \"Forty per cent rosters are now locked in for all employees, which means those coerced by Chevron during COVID to move to a 50 per cent roster will transferred to their previous, more family friendly roster. \"Chevron employees now have union representation, arbitration of disputes in the Fair Work Commission, improved overcycle provisions and significantly enhanced training provisions, including additional payment, allowances and the right to refuse additional work.\"",

              "plaintext": "Australian shares have risen in afternoon trade, helped by gains in energy and financial stocks, while traders awaited the US central bank's policy meeting this week for further interest rate clues. The ASX 200 index advanced 0.3 per cent or 20 points, to 6,793 by 1:37pm AEDT after hitting a more than one-year low on Monday. The US Federal Reserve is expected to leave policy rates on hold at the end of its two-day meeting starting later in the day. Market participants will focus on the message from Fed policymakers to gauge the interest rate outlook. Meanwhile, retail sales in Australia rose at the fastest pace in eight months in September, suggesting resilience in consumer spending which would add to the case for an interest rate hike at the Australian central bank's policy meeting on November 7. Investors are also looking out for a survey of purchasing managers in China's manufacturing segment later in the day to assess the economic recovery of Australia's top trading partner. A Reuters poll showed China's manufacturing activity likely expanded for a second straight month in October. In Sydney, interest rate-sensitive financials rose 0.7 per cent, with the big four banks gaining between 0.5 per cent and 0.7 per cent. Energy stocks jumped 0.3 per cent, with Woodside Energy and Santos up 0.8 per cent and 0.9 per cent, respectively. Technology stocks tracked their Wall Street peers higher, gaining 0.1 per cent. Shares of Xero jumped 0.3 per cent. Gold stocks slid 1.3 per cent, with miner Northern Star Resources losing 2.7 per cent. Among individual stocks, Origin Energy fell 0.6 per cent after superannuation fund AustralianSuper said it plans to vote against a Brookfield-led consortium's $US9.78 billion takeover offer for the company. In corporate news, winemaker Treasury Wine agreed to a $US900 million buyout of California's DAOU Vineyards. Trading in its shares was halted.",
