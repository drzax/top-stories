Operation Hesperidium began in March 2023 after Australian Border Force (ABF) officers examined a consignment of futons imported into Sydney from the United States. ABF examination of the futons located 5.5kg of methamphetamine hidden within the consignment. Another shipment of futons was examined two weeks later and found to contain 15kg of methamphetamine. Ongoing AFP and ABF investigations in Australia assisted Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) and US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) as it detected and seized a combined total of 68kg of methamphetamine concealed in another three shipments of futons – destined for various Sydney addresses – before they were exported from the United States. All three men have been charged with attempting to possess a commercial quantity of methamphetamine. The 33-year-old, 23-year-old Burwood man and 23-year-old Waterloo man appeared before Downing Centre Local Court on June 22, June 7 and September 7 respectively. They were all remanded into custody and will face court again at a later date.",

Business conditions rose 2 points in August with trading conditions, profitability and employment all increasing across most industries. Conditions were the best in manufacturing, but conditions fell sharply in the wholesale industry. Business confidence edged up by 2 index points, but it remains below average. And confidence is mixed across industries, with confidence remaining weakest in retail as people cut back on spending because of the high cost of living. Weighing on sentiment is a fall in forward orders, especially in car retailing and personal and household goods. NAB says that partly reflects normalising order books as backlogs are cleared. Confidence was also negative in mining, finance, business and property.",

Negotiations between the Offshore Alliance union and Chevron over pay and conditions have broken down. Chevron has applied to the Fair Work Commission asking it to intervene in the strike, which began on Friday at the Gorgon and Wheatstone projects in northern Western Australia. Chevron wants the commission to halt the industrial action through an intractable bargaining declaration and says there is no reasonable prospect of an agreement on a new EBA. But the Offshore Alliance says it opposes the application. \"The Offshore Allliance are opposing Chevron's IBD applications and want PIA (protected industrial action) to continue until we secure a union negotiated EBA.\" Work stoppages of up to 10 hours a day are expected to last until Thursday when a two-week strike is expected to kick off if there is no deal. There will be a directions hearing today on Chevron's application in the Fair Work Commission. Gas prices in Europe have surged, with the two projects responsible for more than 5 per cent of global LNG supply.",

The Westpac-Melbourne Institute survey of consumer sentiment fell by 1.5 per cent to 79.7 in September from 81 in August. A figure below 100 shows that pessimists outnumber optimists. The confidence of mortgage borrowers lifted 7.8 per cent over August, but confidence fell for renters (-6.1 per cent) and people who own their homes outright (-5.8 per cent). Westpac chief economist Bill Evans says that sentiment has languished at deeply pessimistic levels for more than a year, beaten only by the recession of the 1990s, when even weaker levels of confidence held for more than two years. \"Persistent permission has continued despite easing fears of further interest rate rises.\" \"The strong message from survey detail is of ongoing intense pressures on family finances.\" Mr Evans says a 15 per cent rise in petrol prices over the past two months is worsening concerns about the cost of living, on top of already strong increases in rent and electricity. Confidence in family finances fell by 4.4 per cent over the month, while fewer people thought it was a good time to buy a major household item (-3 per cent).",
