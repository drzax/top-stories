Construction work completed rose 1.8 per cent to $57.7 billion over the first few months of the year according to the Bureau of Statistics. That was driven by more engineering work mainly from the public sector, but the value of residential construction fell by 2 per cent over the March quarter, and by 5.1 per cent over the year. You can see why Australia has a housing crisis, not enough homes are being built. Here's the analysis from CBA economist Harry Otley, who says it was a mixed result. \"Residential construction was weak but engineering construction was strong,\" he wrote in an economics note. \"Both the public and private sector investment in infrastructure have solid momentum.\" \"Price pressures remain, but inflation in the industry is in a clear downward trend.\" Australia faces a shortage of more than 100,000 new homes over the next five years, and figures from the corporate regulator show that 1753 companies have gone broke so far this financial year because of cost rises and labour shortages. As my colleague Jane Norman reports that is an average of five a day.",
