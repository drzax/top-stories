According to Russian authorities the launch placed a new generation 'GLONASS-K2' global navigation satellite into orbit. \"This launch was notified and remnants of the rocket were planned to safely re-enter the atmosphere into the ocean off the south-east coast of Tasmania. \"The Australian Space Agency will continue to monitor the outcomes of this re-entry with our Government partners.\"",

Giacomo Chiapparini, 74, was buried under the cheeses when a shelf broke in his warehouse in the northern Lombardy region creating a domino effect which brought down thousands of wheels, firefighter Antonio Dusi from Bergamo tells AFP. It reportedly took 12 hours for rescuers to move the cheeses and wheels by hand to finally find Chiapparini. The warehouse, located in the small town of Romano di Lombardia near Bergamo, contained a total of 25,000 wheels of Grana Padano.",

The retailer predicts that after tax profit will come in between $69 million to $73 million, up 15 to 21 per cent from a year ago, but below a forecast of $88.5 million by financial news service Refinitiv. Myer says sales rose 12.5 per cent from the 2022 financial year to $3.6 billion, that's despite deteriorating trading conditions over the first half of 2023. Australia is in the midst of a consumer recession, as households cut back on spending because of high cost of living. Retail volumes have gone backward for three quarters in a row amid high interest rates and inflation.

Business conditions eased 1 point to 10 index points. Trading conditions, employment and profitability were all steady according to NAB chief economist Alan Oster. “Business conditions continued to show resilience in July and have been broadly steady in the past couple of months at above-average levels,\" he says. “Business confidence also picked up in July to be back in positive territory as well, although confidence remains low.” However, forward orders remain in negative territory, dragged down by the retail sector, and costs continue to rise for companies including for electricity and wages. “Labour cost growth rose sharply in July, likely reflecting wage rises taking effect on July 1 including minimum and award wage changes,” said Mr Oster. “Labour cost growth was strongest in recreation & personal services, transport & utilities, and retail, which aligns with where we would expect minimum and award wage workers to be most common.”",

Westpac and the Melbourne Institute says consumer sentiment dropped 0.4 per cent to 81 in August. A figure below 100 shows there are more pessimists than optimists. Westpac senior economist Matthew Hassan says the Reserve Bank interest rate pauses last month and this month have done little to lift confidence, probably because the RBA has warned that more rate rises may be needed. \"The August survey detail pointed to little or no impact from the RBA’s decision to pause. \" \"Responses showed no improvement over the course of survey week, sentiment instead declining 4.9 per cent between those surveyed prior to the RBA decision and those surveyed after.\" \"The sub-group detail also continued to show a disappointing reaction from the mortgage belt – sentiment amongst consumers with a mortgage down 7.2 per cent in the August month and, 0.8 per cent below its June level despite the two-month pause.\" \"Most consumers are still bracing for further rate rises with over two-thirds of those surveyed after the RBA decision expecting rates to move higher over the year ahead, nearly half of this group expecting a rise of over 1 percentage point.\" He says consumers are worried about inflation, including recent fuel and energy price rises, with pressure on family finances and concerns about rates and the economic outlook.",
