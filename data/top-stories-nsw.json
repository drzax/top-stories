He was campaigning in Sydney’s inner-west at the Addi Road Food Bank with 2023 Local Hero of the Year and founder of Turbans 4 Australia, Amar Singh. \"We're working very hard to overcome the misinformation that the no campaign is throwing at all communities in the country, not the least the multicultural community,” Mr Pearson said. “We've done a heap of events with people in western Sydney here with English as a second language communities.\" During the event he briefly broke into song, using lyrics he says were written by “Aunty Dora” in his home community. \"What of the first peoples unrecognised and unseen voices of wisdom silenced from the start, erased from history?\" he sang, to the gathered group. Mr Pearson called on “the Italian,” “the Greeks,” “the Eastern Europeans,” and the “western Europeans,” who “built this country” and “built great lives here for your families”. “Extend the hand of opportunity to the original peoples of this country.” Mr Singh has travelled around the country promoting the Voice to Parliament to diverse communities because he believes it'll make \"a better, more diverse Australia\".",
