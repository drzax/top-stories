The company, named xAI, aims to \"understand the true nature of the universe\", according to its website. It's not Musk's first venture into AI — he cofounded OpenAI (which is behind ChatGPT) but later left the startup, which has become one of the highest-profile companies in the AI space. But the Twitter owner has been wary of AI in the past, warning about its potential for \"civilisational destruction\" and a race amongst tech companies to develop it should wait until there's draft regulation for the sector. Musk's team has several former engineers and scientists from Google, Microsoft and OpenAI, and is actively recruiting for more technical staff. We can expect to hear more about xAI during a Twitter Spaces chat (where else?) on Friday, July 14 (local time).",

The UN report found both domestic and external debt around the world increased more than five times in the last 20 years — a rate faster than economic growth, when gross domestic product (GDP) only tripled. The report comes days before a G20 meeting of finance ministers and central bank governors. \"Markets may seem not be suffering — yet. But people are,\" UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said. \"Some of the poorest countries in the world are being forced into a choice between servicing their debt, or serving their people.\" Of all the public debt, developing countries make up around 30% of it, with 70% coming from China, India and Brazil. The UN report also says 59 developing countries have a debt-to-GDP ratio over 60%, which indicates high levels of debt.",

The big news overnight that's buoyed global markets is that US inflation has slowed, with consumer prices seeing their smallest annual increase in more than two years. The CPI rose by 0.2% in June, slightly less than the general consensus of 0.3% expected by analysts — and the smallest annual increase since March 2021. Year-on-year, US CPI rose by 3%, but that is the smallest rise since 2021. Core inflation in June also rose to 4.8%, but is lower than the 5.3% increase the US saw in May. So does this mean rate hikes are off the table now for the Federal Reserve? It's unlikely to dissuade them from raising them at their meeting this month, but it's raised the possibility that the expected July hike of 0.25 percentage points could be the last. Off the back of the inflation data, US markets ended solidly higher on Wednesday (local time) with the Dow up 0.3%, S & P500 up 0.7%, and the Nasdaq jumping 1.2%. As for what's happening back home — the ASX is set for a positive day with futures trading higher so far this morning. But all eyes will be on Canberra today, where the bosses of Westpac and Commonwealth Bank are facing a grilling about interest rates during the second day of hearings in front of the the economics committee in parliament. It comes after ANZ and NAB's bosses gave evidence yesterday. It's shaping up to be a big day — grab a coffee and let's get into it.",
