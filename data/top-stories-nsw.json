A lot of economists, such as Steven Hamilton and Chris Richardson, argue measures to relieve the cost of living such as power bill subsidies will leave households with more money to spend and thus be inflationary, at least to some degree. But the Commonwealth Bank's head of Australian economics Gareth Aird, who was recently in the minority of market economists who successfully forecast the RBA's May rate hike, believes the budget may even help bring down inflation, as the Treasurer has claimed. \"The Government's Energy Price Relief Plan is expected to subtract 0.75ppts [percentage points] from headline inflation in 2023/24. Medicare bulk billing incentives along with childcare subsidies will also put downward pressure directly on measured inflation. \"It can be argued that these packages free up some consumer cash flow to spend on other goods and services. And therefore the second round impacts of the package are inflationary. But we don't subscribe to that view. \"Inflation expectations are a driver of inflation over the medium term. And inflation expectation can be heavily influenced by actual inflation. Lowering measured inflation in the short run at a time when there remains lingering concerns around inflation psychology makes a lot of sense. It is both smart politics and smart economics. \"Many wage agreements and price outcomes are set with the level of actual inflation in mind. If measured inflation recedes more quickly it can dampen down the consumer and business expectation of entrenching price rises – a welcome outcome.\" My colleague Kate Ainsworth had a comprehensive article earlier this week featuring both sides of the debate.",

              "plaintext": "Just before the Bank of England busied itself with another rate rise, the RBA released a raft of internal research due to a Freedom of Information request. The most interesting was some modelling done by a senior analyst in the Economic Analysis Department in September last year that found Australia had between a 50 to 80% chance of recession if the Reserve Bank was successful in returning inflation below 3% by late-2024. If the bank was a bit slower in lowering inflation, leaving it just above the target band by the end of 2024, recession risk could be as low as 30 per cent, depending which model was used. But that is still much higher than the 5 per cent chance of recession Australia would normally have according to recent history, and 13 per cent odds over a longer historical period. I spoke to Kath Robinson about it on The Business last night. There was some other research, from earlier this year, that modelled the effects of different interest rate paths on inflation and unemployment. Some of those models looked at a cash rate as high as 4.8 per cent, but the RBA's most recent forecasts and actions make it look very unlikely it will push rates that far.
