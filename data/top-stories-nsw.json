A Russian proposal calls for a cease-fire while a Brazilian draft seeks \"humanitarian pauses\" to let aid flow and urges Israel to rescind its order for an evacuation of northern Gaza. Either draft, if adopted, would mark the first collective statement on the war from the UN's most powerful organ. Both draft resolutions, obtained by The Associated Press, call for releasing all hostages. The council has become increasingly divided on many issues amid Russia's war in Ukraine.
