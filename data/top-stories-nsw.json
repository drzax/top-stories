But the Fair Work Commission (FWC) award wages decision does seem to have had some influence on the ASX. From an early high of 7,166 around 10:12am AEST, around the time the FWC handed down its wages determination, the ASX 200 index has steadily pared back its gains to 7,131 points. That is still up 0.3% on yesterday's close, but well off the S & P 500's 1% gain on Wall Street overnight. There are two reasons why a higher than expected award wage increase may have had this effect: It will push up costs for businesses who pay their employees award rates or whose enterprise agreements are benchmarked off the award. Some economists believe it will raise pressure on the Reserve Bank to raise interest rates again, possibly as soon as next week. That seems to be reflected in the sectors gaining and losing ground. Mining, utilities and energy are up — they are much more affected by global pricing forces, with wages a smaller share of costs and most of their workforces above award rates anyway. Consumer non-cyclicals (dominated by the big supermarkets), financials and healthcare are down. These are labour intensive sectors, with many employees either on award rates or on enterprise agreements that are not a huge amount above award rates, so many of these firms are likely to see their costs rise substantially as a result of today's decision.",

Let me explain. The FWC spent a good chunk of its decision talking about the C14 classification. For the last 25 years, that classification has been aligned with the national minimum wage. In today's decision, the FWC is ending that alignment between C14 classification and the national minimum wage. Instead, the national minimum wage will be aligned with a slightly higher classification of C13 — and that classification's wage rate will jump by 5.75%. For those workers who were once on the C14 rate, it means they will be getting a total pay increase of 8.6%. That's why the minimum wage in dollar values is now $23.23 an hour, or $882.80 a week. If it were only a 5.75% increase, the hourly rate for those minimum wage workers would have been $22.60. But the FWC has framed the increase in the minimum wage as only being a 5.75% increase, because that's the size of the increase in the C13 classification rate that the minimum wage will now be aligned with.",

RBC Capital Markets economist Su-Lin Ong believes today's wages decision, along with continued resilience in the Australian labour market and the potential for another US rate hike, will see the Reserve Bank hike interest rates twice more. \"We have held a 3.85% terminal RBA forecast in our profile for some time but argued the risk was to the upside with the macro outlook suggesting that a more restrictive policy stance is prudent,\" she wrote in a note to clients. \"Following several recent developments, including the outcome of today's minimum wage decision, we are adding a 25bp [basis point] hike to our RBA profile in June and another 25bp in July. \"We are mindful of the poor optics for a hike next week following today's wage decision. If the RBA opts to pause again next week, hikes in July and August are likely.\" But there are plenty of economists who don't agree. \"Given the magnitude, coverage and recent momentum ex-minimum wages, today's outcome seems consistent with the RBA's existing forecast so we don't expect any upward revisions to wages in the next forecast round (August),\" wrote JP Morgan's Tom Kennedy. \"By implication it also hasn't shifted our assessment for the RBA next week; we expect an on-hold decision and market pricing for a 35-40% chance of a 25bp hike seems fair .\"",
