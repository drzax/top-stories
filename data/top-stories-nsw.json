The decision is another blow for the Commonwealth Games Federation (CGF) after the Canadian city of Hamilton (which hosted the inaugural Games in 1930) suspended its bid and Australia's Victorian government last month withdrew as host of the 2026 Games due to projected cost overruns. The Alberta bid was scuttled for similar reasons, Reuters reports. \"We promised to remain transparent with Albertans about the costs of hosting international sporting events and clearly demonstrating a return on our investment for the people and communities of Alberta,\" wrote Mackenzie Blyth, press secretary to the Minister of Tourism and Sports Joseph Schow in an email to CBC. \"In the case of the 2030 Commonwealth Games, the numbers just didn't add up for our government to commit taxpayer's money with the games estimated to cost $CA2.68 billion ($3.1 billion).\"",

The August statement has given more detail about why Australia's central bank chose to leave interest rates on hold this month, surprising many economists. One thing is clear — the decision not to raise rates further was again a close call. \"At both the July and August meetings, the board considered the option of raising rates further,\" the SOMP observed. \"The board's current assessment is that the risks around the inflation outlook are broadly balanced. \"But it recognises that the crystallisation of upside risks would increase the likelihood of inflation staying high for longer and a rise in medium-term inflation expectations.\"",
