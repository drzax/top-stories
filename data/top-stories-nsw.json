              "plaintext": "With the RBA's cash rate meeting fast approaching next Tuesday, markets are growing more and more convinced that we'll see them deliver a rate hike. It would be the first time the RBA would increase the cash rate since in four months, and all of the big four banks are expecting a 0.25 percentage point increase, which would take the cash rate to 4.35% — the highest rate since November 2011. Scott Solomon, a co-portfolio manager at T. Rowe Price says it's not necessarily an obvious decision that the RBA would lift rates, given the messaging by other central banks around the world. \" The decision is not an obvious one as most other central banks around the world have indicated they are likely done hiking,\" he said. \"However, given a recent strong inflation print, the minutes of the prior meeting showing a surprising balance between a hike and a no hike decision. In addition, the recent easing of financial conditions post the Fed's dovish pause, the calculus is tipped in favour of a hike. \" But Mr Solomon says the RBA could surprise us with a smaller hike of 0.15 percentage points — although he conceded it was \"unlikely\" to happen. \"Governor Bullock will likely try to pitch the decision as largely precautionary in nature,\" he said. \"In fact, I think it would be a nice opportunity to hike 15 [basis points] and bring the terminal rate to a more traditional 4.25%. \" It is unlikely they do that – but the RBA is no stranger to surprises and would check a lot of boxes.\" All will be revealed next Tuesday at 2:30pm AEDT.",

About 200 members of the Retail and Fast Food Workers Union in Victoria went on strike on Friday while an extra 400 in other states held shorter stoppages, according to the union. \"Workers are paid poverty wages in unsafe workplaces, they've got insecure jobs and we need that to change,\" union secretary Josh Cullinan said. \"Our members can't afford the groceries that they sell.\" Mr Cullinan said the strike was purposefully staged on the day of the annual meeting and was critical of the gathering being held in a complex protected by police and security guards when ordinary workers didn't have that level of safety. Coles worker and union delegate Nelio Da Silva said a lot of staff at his store were struggling and abuse against workers was on the rise. \"The $1.1 billion in profit Coles has made, that needs to be shared around amongst workers, the community, everyone,\" Mr Da Silva said. Inside, Coles chair James Graham told the meeting the supermarket giant had 120,000 team members and that the Retail and Fast Food Workers Union represented around 500 of them. Coles was negotiating with the union in good faith, as it would with any representative for its workers, he said. \"Because we need to have a positive and supportive relationships with our team members, in order that we can conduct our business in a way which we're proud of, and our customers enjoy and feel comfortable with,\" Mr Graham said. Twice-yearly surveys that Coles conducts of its team members found that most are positive, confident and proud to recommend Coles, he said. \"But there will be inevitably be issues … and we'll work those issues through.\" — AAP",

One citizen and one permanent resident were able to exit through the Rafah crossing out of Gaza during the second window for foreign nationals to evacuate on Thursday. The Australians, who were on a list to get out of Gaza in the first opportunity on Wednesday, made the crossing into Egypt with the help of consular officials from the UK. They will join the rest of the other 23 Australians who got out of Gaza safely on Wednesday for onward travel to Cairo. \"We continue to engage closely with partners in the region and do all we can to enable the remaining Australians in Gaza, who wish to leave, to do so as soon as possible,\" a foreign affairs department spokesman said. \"The timing of those departures depends on a range of factors. \"The situation in Gaza continues to be highly challenging and can change rapidly.\" More than 800 people have been able to leave Gaza via the Rafah crossing under a deal brokered between the US, Egypt, Israel and Qatar. A third crossing opportunity is expected to take place on Friday. Reporting with AAP",
