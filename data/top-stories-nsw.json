Philip Lowe will take questions at a Senate estimates hearing on a variety of matters, but the pathway for interest rates will likely dominate discussions. From May 2022, the RBA lifted interest rates 10 times in a row before pausing in April, as it aimed to slow inflation. The central bank board then opted to lift interest rates by another 25 basis points in May â a move that few were expecting after keeping rates on hold for just one month. New inflation figures are also out at 11:30am AEST today, from the Bureau of Statistics. Expectations are for a 6.4 per cent uptick in headline inflation in April, up from 6.3 per cent in March. While past its 7 per cent peak, inflation remains well above its two-to-three per cent target range. Our Business team will have all the latest on both in their upcoming live blog.",

Police and witnesses say the shooting began as a group of people fought in front of a busy stretch of shops on the Hollywood Oceanfront Broadwalk at around 7pm local time. Authorities say the gunmen ran from the scene during the chaos, as hundreds of people fled for their lives and dived for cover as shots hit bystanders. Two people involved in the altercation that led to the shooting have been arrested on firearms charges, police say. Five handguns have also been recovered, with one of them reported stolen in the Miami area and another in Texas. The shooting upended busy holiday weekend festivities at the popular beach destination where there was already a heavy police presence to oversee the big crowds.",
