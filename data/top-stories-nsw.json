That's 4.2% lower than the previous lowest record, which was set in November last year. So what does this mean? That the total amount of electricity supplied by grid-scale generation in the National Electricity Market (NEM) at 12:30pm on September 17 was at its new record low. That was due to residential rooftop solar displacing the need for grid-scale generation, because consumers' solar systems were contributing 49.6% of the total (or underlying) demand. (The NEM includes all states and territories, except WA and the NT). Additionally, South Australia also saw a new operational minimum demand record on September 16 at 1:30pm, with 21 megawatts — making it the lowest operational demand a state has ever reached in the NEM.",
