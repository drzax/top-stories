According to Russian authorities the launch placed a new generation 'GLONASS-K2' global navigation satellite into orbit. \"This launch was notified and remnants of the rocket were planned to safely re-enter the atmosphere into the ocean off the south-east coast of Tasmania. \"The Australian Space Agency will continue to monitor the outcomes of this re-entry with our Government partners.\"",

              "plaintext": "The traditional owners of the Juukan Gorge in the Pilbara in Western Australia say First Nations people are being put last by the WA government after the scrapping of new cultural heritage laws. Earlier today WA premier Roger Cook announced that a new law would be overturned after complaints by property owners and farmers. A 1972 cultural heritage law will be reinstated with amendments to allow Indigenous groups the right of appeal. The 2021 law was introduced in response to the destruction of sacred caves at Juukan Gorge by Rio Tinto in 2020 to expand an iron ore mine. The Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura Aboriginal Corporation say the Cook government's plan to repeal the laws demonstrates that Indigenous people and their culture are a low priority. PKKP land and heritage manager Dr Jordan Ralph says reverting to the outdated 1972 legislation is among the worst decisions for Aboriginal cultural heritage protection this  country has seen. “The PKKP are outraged that they, and traditional owners in Western Australia are back to  square one, and the Cook government is reverting to laws that allowed to destruction of Juukan  Gorge.\" “The safeguards that were supposed to be provided by the 2021 legislation have now been taken  away and we will revert back to an outdated definition of Aboriginal cultural heritage and an  approvals process that benefits industry over our country,” Dr Ralph says the PKKP has lost faith that the state's lawmakers can protect Indigenous sacred sites in WA. Here's more from Amelia Searson on aftermath of the destruction of 46,000 year old rock shelters at Juukan Gorge.",
