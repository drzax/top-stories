I've had a (quick) deep dive into the RBA history books, and there have only been three governors who took on the top job without being deputy governor first. Those three are: Bernie Fraser, RBA governor from 1989 to 1996 Bob Johnston, RBA governor from 1982 to 1989 Herbert 'Nugget' Coombs, RBA governor from 1960 to 1962, then again from 1963 to 1968 That means five out of the past eight RBA governors have been deputy governor before taking on the top job — and now with Michele Bullock, that will make it six out of nine deputies going on to become governor.",
