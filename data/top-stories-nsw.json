The Insurance Council of Australia, Master Builders Australia, and the Planning Institute of Australia, supported by the Australian Local Government Association, want planning rules changed so no more homes are built in high-risk flood prone locations. They held an industry round table to day to press their case. Planning ministers will report this year on developing a national standard for considering disaster and climate risk, and end development on flood plains. Here's Andrew Hall, chief executive of the Insurance Council of Australia: \"The flood events of 2022, with almost 300,000 disaster-related claims costing around $7 billion, has driven up premiums and has resulted in affordability constraints for those at highest risk.\" Matt Collins, chief executive of the Planning Institute of Australia, says new risk-based policies are needed to avoid or minimise exposure to floods. \"Planning is a critical tool for influencing the level of future disaster risk, and our changing climate means we need to act now to limit the impact of extreme weather on our communities.\" Councillor Linda Scott, president of the Australian Local Government Association: \"Australia’s 537 councils play a vital role in building resilient communities, assisting in every corner of the nation to ensure our communities can better prepare for, respond to and recover from increasing natural disasters.\" \"It’s crucial we rebuild damaged local infrastructure to a more resilient standard.\"",
