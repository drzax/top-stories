This week, the RBA raised the cash rate for a twelfth time to 4.1 per cent, its highest rate in more than a decade. Anna Bligh, CEO of the Australian Banking Association, says more customers are \"thinking of what other options they might have\" if rising rates make it \"impossible\" for some customers to keep up with their repayments. She encouraged borrowers who are struggling to call their bank to discuss their options sooner rather than later. \"There are very practical ways that banks can help to ease the financial pressure, temporarily, for several months,\" she said. \"They can put you on an interest-only arrangement, they can, in some cases, defer payments for a period of time.\" You can listen to the full interview between Hamish Macdonald and Anna Bligh via the RN Breakfast website .",
