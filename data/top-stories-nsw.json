Matildas coach Tony Gustavsson cut to the chase when asked about the role Australia's superstar captain would play in Saturday's Women's World Cup quarterfinal. Kerr has played a tick over 10 minutes against Denmark to date, with a starting front four of Caitlin Foord, Mary Fowler, Emily van Egmond and Hayley Raso thriving in her absence. But Gustavsson dismissed the suggestion dropping someone for Kerr, if she is fit to start after returning from her calf injury, could disrupt that dynamic. \"They've been amazing teammates supporting each other. There's been no complaints whatsoever in terms of if you start or come off the bench - they know their role and they play their role,\" Gustavsson said. \"And I definitely would never, ever see Sam as a disturbance to the team. \"I want to be very clear in here now to say if Sam is fit to play 90 minutes, she is starting. There is not even a question and the team knows it. \"We're talking about Sam Kerr here. \"Whether she is ready to play 90 minutes plus extra time, that's to be decided tonight. But there is no question whatsoever that if she is, she is starting.\" -AAP",
