AustralianSuper says it's going to refund an estimated $70 million to around 100,000 customers, who were being double charged fees and insurance costs. The fund manages almost $290 billion in retirement savings for 3.1 million Australians. It says it did a review of how it manages multiple accounts, and found it had not eradicated all examples of double up. That means it had members with multiple accounts under the fund who were potentially paying double the fees and insurance. AustralianSuper says it expectes to repay around $650 per impacted person. It says both current and former customers impacted will be contacted in \"coming months\". \"This should not have happened, and we apologise unreservedly to members,\" its statement said. \"The Fund is taking appropriate remediation actions and has self-reported the issue to the regulators.\" The advocacy group for people with superannuation funds says the revelation by AustralianSuper is \"alarming\". \"Paying extra fees and insurance premiums for more than one account really adds up,\" Rosie Thomas, Super Consumers Australia's deputy director says. \"The Productivity Commission found having unnecessary multiple accounts can leave someone over $50,000 worse off in retirement. \"It’s important we fix this problem across the super system, and getting funds to sort out intra-fund consolidation is the first step. \"The laws to encourage super funds to get rid of multiple accounts within their own fund are a decade old. \"We’ve never seen any public statement or actions from the regulators on this issue. It is alarming that such a major player is only discovering issues now.\" It now wants a review of all super funds into this issue. Are you an AustralianSuper customer? Have you been told you've got a double up issue? Send me an email on terzon.emilia@abc.net.au This saga from AustralianSuper comes off the back of a general crackdown on fees in the super industry. We just published this list with the best and worst performing funds.",
