              "plaintext": "Capital Economics analyst Abhijit Surya has come out with one of the first notes on New Zealand's now confirmed recession. He says the March quarter decline of 0.1% was in line with analyst forecasts, but \"markedly weaker\" than what the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) expected. Surprisingly, private consumption and fixed investment both grew strongly in the quarter in the face of steep rate rises that have taken New Zealand's cash rate to 5.5%, among the highest in the developed world. \" Private consumption grew by a solid 2.4% q/q [quarter on quarter], likely reflecting the confluence of a strong labour market, resurgent net overseas migration and a lower savings rate,\" Mr Surya noted. However, these GDP figures are from the first three months of this year, and Mr Surya says more recent data show household consumption is diving in New Zealand. \"Indeed, it increasingly appears that activity will have weakened further in Q2,\" he noted. \"According to StatNZ's monthly activity index, output growth slowed from 1.3% y/y in March to 0.7% in April. \"Meanwhile, more timely data show that electronic card transactions fell by a sharp 2% m/m in May, which suggests private consumption is in fact on shaky ground.\" So, there's a good chance that NZ could be in for at least three consecutive quarters of economic contraction. The silver lining for Kiwis is that Capital Economics is expecting the recession to force the RBNZ to change tack and start cutting interest rates towards the end of this year. \"As demand-side pressures on inflation continue to abate, the case for rate cuts will become increasingly compelling,\" Mr Surya argued.",

Even the Reserve Bank of New Zealand had forecast that the country's economy would fall into a recession later this year. New Zealand's current cash rate sits at 5.5%, and their central bank had been aggressively hiking rates, in stark contrast to what we've seen in Australia. And now figures from Stats NZ show that most parts of the economy slowed, with business services hitting the brakes the most, falling 3.5%. \"Management consulting, advertising, scientific, and engineering design services drove the fall in business services,\" said Stats NZ's Jason Attewell. The last time New Zealand experienced a recession was in September 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, when it experienced its worst quarterly GDP fall on record. But New Zealand's economy bounced back out of the recession in the following quarter. You can read more about New Zealand's race to recession from business editor Ian Verrender below:",
