In a statement, Allegro said the new business will be \"fully independent\" of PwC. In recent months, PwC has been caught up in a damaging tax scandal. It led to eight senior partners being forced out, government departments refusing to extend their consulting contracts with the firm, and its senior management being grilled before Senate inquiries. The scandal involved a senior partner using secret information it obtained from the government (while advising it on on how to increase the tax paid by multinational companies), working out a loophole to get around them, and selling the plan to those companies, making millions of dollars in fees. Some commentors have compared PwC's conduct as simliar to a 'double agent'. \"Scyne Advisory will establish an independent Board of Directors to oversee a rigorous, ASX-standard of governance and integrity in the business,\" Allegro said. To allay concerns about the integrity of the new business, Allegro has hired former Federal Court judge Andrew Greenwood to join the board as a non-executive director.

Shane Oliver (AMP Capital, chief economist): \"Itâs a very close call but on balance we expect that the RBA will raise the cash rate again on Tuesday by another 0.25% taking it to 4.35%. \"The lower-than-expected May CPI [consumer price index] provides scope for another pause. \"We continue to think that the RBA has already done enough with inflation already falling and that itâs not paying enough attention to the lags with which monetary policy impacts the economy which runs the now very high risk of tipping us into recession.\" Jarek Kowcza (St George, senior economist): \"While we acknowledge that it is likely to be another âfinely balancedâ decision, we think the scales are tilted towards another 25-basis-point hike this month. \"Financial market pricing implies that there is a good chance of two more hikes (i.e. to 4.60%) before we reach the terminal rate, with a peak rate of 4.53% priced by the end of 2023. \"However, markets are uncertain around when these hikes are likely to be delivered.\" Rodrigo Catril (NAB, senior foreign exchange strategist): \"NAB expects the RBA to raise the cash rate to 4.6% in the months ahead, having pencilled in 25bps [basis points] hikes in July and August. \"The data flow argues that the RBA should hike on Tuesday, with little value in waiting for more data. \"Saying that, the decision is likely to be as evenly balanced as it was last month, and it would not be a surprise if the RBA chose to hold fire at this meeting in anticipation of the full quarterly CPI [consumer price index] and SoMP [statement on monetary policy] forecast update.\" Belinda Allen, CBA senior economist \"In what is likely to be another finely balanced decision, we expect the RBA to leave the cash rate on hold at 4.10% in July, pausing before one final rate hike in August. \"The RBA has stated that the June meeting was finely balanced, with the rate hike driven by upside inflation risks. \"The lower than expected monthly CPI print for May has, in our view, tilted the balance of risks to an on hold decision in July. \"But the July RBA Board meeting remains âliveâ given the RBAâs tightening bias and heighted concerns over inflation risks. \"We attach a 60% probability of on hold decision at the July RBA Board meeting, with a 40% chance of a 25bp hike.\"",

The S & P 500 gained 0.1%, while the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.2% and the Dow Jones index was steady. Tesla was one of the best-performers, after its share price jumped 6.9%. The electric car maker said it delivered a record number of vehicles in the June quarter (beating market estimates). The Elon Musk-led company handed 466,140 vehicles in the April to June period (up 10% from the preceding quarter, and 83% higher from a year earlier). These numbers from Tesla are the closest approximation of its sales figures, and are closely watched by analysts and shareholders.
