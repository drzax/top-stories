Political reporter Evelyn Manfield explains what's being debated: This is the second tranche of the government's industrial relations reform. Under the change, the Fair Work Act would be amended to close a so-called loophole where an employer and employees have agreed through an enterprise agreement to a particular rate of pay, but then that pay is undercut when the employer brings in different workers through labour hire. The bill is also promising to introduce greater protections for gig economy workers and casuals, and increase penalties for wage theft. But business groups are opposing the changes, arguing they add complexity and will drive up costs. Political reporter Stephanie Borys was on News Breakfast earlier and said the bill will be debated for four weeks in the House of Representatives before it goes to the Senate where the government needs to find the numbers from the Greens and crossbench to get it through.",

Buffett, 76, had Merkel cell cancer, according to the statement, which also noted the Margaritaville singer died at his home in Sag Harbor, New York, near the Hamptons. He had been fighting the cancer for four years while continuing to perform, the last time making a surprise appearance in Rhode Island in early July, the statement said. Merkel cell carcinoma, as it's known in medical literature, is very rare and tends to spread quickly, including to parts of the body beyond the skin, according to the federal National Cancer Institute and the Mayo Clinic. Risk factors include a lot of sun exposure, a weakened immune system, a history of other cancers, and being light-skinned and over 50.",
