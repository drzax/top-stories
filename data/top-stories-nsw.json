They get drinking water in jerrycans from the UN school. It tastes salty. The desalination stations stopped working when the fuel ran out. \"How the hell did the entire world just watch and let Israel turn off the water?\" says Mr Keshawi, 59, a US-educated researcher at the International Crisis Group, his voice rising with anger. The nights are the hardest, he says. When airstrikes crash nearby and explosions light up the sky, the adults muster what little resolve they have to soothe the children. \"Boom!\" they yell and cheer when the bombs thunder. The babies laugh. But older kids are terrified. \"It's really killing me,\" Mr Keshawi says. \"It really breaks my heart.\" AP",

A prime-time television address to the nation gives the commander in chief a direct line to the homes of ordinary Americans (hoping that they're still watching broadcast or cable television instead of streaming something). He kept his language simple. Attempting to explain why Americans should both care about wars being fought far away and be willing to help fund them. His message was pretty simple – if America doesn't help fight Ukraine and Israel defend themselves now, then it'll create greater problem later. \"History has taught us that when terrorists don't pay a price for their terror, when dictators don't pay a price for their aggression, they cause more chaos and death and more destruction,\" he said. The United States has sent Ukraine $US60 billion in funding and equipment through military, economic, and humanitarian aid. Israel is the biggest recipient of US foreign aid, being given nearly $US160 billion before this latest outbreak of violence. It's expected the latest request will be for tens of billions more. For Americans who've had to battle through a period of high inflation, it's understandable that many would start to question why America has to foot the bill for foreign conflicts. Mr Biden will hope that his 15 minute speech will convince them that it's money well spent.",

It's all because yesterday it announced a billion-dollar funding package for its flagship Kathleen Valley lithium project, planning to raise $376 million in a discounted share placement and $760 million via debt. Funding plans had to change because earlier in the week US-based Albemarle Corp withdrew its $6.6 billion buyout bid, citing 'growing complexities.' The withdrawal came days after Hancock Prospecting (Gina Rinehart's company!) raised its stake to 19.9% of Liontown (which would have been enough to block the Albemarle bid of $3 per share). The Kathleen Valley project is widely regarded as one of the world's top five lithium projects, and Liontown has already signed deals to supply Ford Motor and Tesla.
