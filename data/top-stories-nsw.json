A dozen people holding \"Free Palestine\" signs were chanting prayers and pro-Palestinian statements, centred around a singular protester who had their arm stuck inside a heavy concrete barrel. It's believed nearly 100 staff and contractors at Pine Gap were prevented from entering the site. Protestor and Central Arrernte man Declan-Furber Gillick said the group had gathered to take a stand against the Australian government's \"appalling, shameful hypocrisy\" in supporting \"Israeli continued domination and occupation\" of Palestinian lands. \"I reject the assertion that Hamas or any Palestinian group armed or otherwise instigated this war,\" he said. \"These recent responses by Hamas as an organisation are … the direct response to decades and decades and decades of repression of the Palestinian people.\" Northern Territory police and emergency services attended the scene, directing the protestors off the road, while firefighters used an angle grinder to break the barrel open. The main protester has since been arrested by police.",

The bombardments keep coming closer, he says, and they're wreaking death and destruction. Mr Keshawi, his wife, two sons, two daughters and tiny grandchildren are trying to survive inside. They get drinking water in jerrycans from the UN school. It tastes salty. The desalination stations stopped working when the fuel ran out. \"How the hell did the entire world just watch and let Israel turn off the water?\" says Mr Keshawi, 59, a US-educated researcher at the International Crisis Group, his voice rising with anger. The nights are the hardest, he says. When airstrikes crash nearby and explosions light up the sky, the adults muster what little resolve they have to soothe the children. \"Boom!\" they yell and cheer when the bombs thunder. The babies laugh. But older kids are terrified. \"It's really killing me,\" Mr Keshawi says. \"It really breaks my heart.\" AP",

They have agreed to leave at Qantas' interim result in February, while Mr Goyder will step down ahead of the 2024 annual general meeting — but in Goyder's case some say that is not soon enough. You can learn more about that here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmopL2u9Nxw But it seems investors still want more board rejuvenation at Qantas. On Wednesday Ms Brenner faced a 17 per cent protest vote against her re-election at Telstra, after proxy firm Institutional Shareholder Services recommended against her because of her concurrent board role at the airline. But what for Todd Sampson? The Qantas board's in-house marketing and public relations expert may be the next target of big investors. Proxy advisor Ownership Matter has recommended Mr Sampson be forced to exit the company at the national carrier's upcoming annual general meeting. While another adviser to institutional investors, ISS, \"notes\" ongoing concerns about accountability, as well as Sampson's role on the remuneration committee. It will be interesting to see how investors react when the airline holds its annual general meeting at the Melbourne Convention and Exhibition Centre on November 3.",
