That's about 2 per cent of its 3,827 stores globally. It will partner with experienced franchisees to run up to 75 corporate owned stories that have improved their performance, and reduce the number of new stores that it opens. Domino's will also bring pizza dough making in-house at its stores in south east Asia, and close its Brisbane based construction and supply services subsidiary. It estimates the moves will save it $53 million to $59 million annually. \"Wherever there is the potential for reducing duplication, or achieving increased efficiencies, we will pursue these with continuous focus on delivering for our franchise network,\" said Domino's boss Don Meij. \"Making the decision to close any store is a difficult one, but for these stores it is the right one.",
