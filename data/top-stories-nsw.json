The cyclone made landfall on Sunday afternoon in Myanmar's Rakhine state near Sittwe township, with winds of up to 209 kilometers per hour, Myanmar's Meteorological Department says —making the storm a dangerous category five cyclone. The extent of the damage in Sittwe isn't clear just yet. Earlier yesterday, high winds crumpled mobile phone towers, cutting off communications in much of the area. In videos collected by local media before communications were cut off, deep water races through streets while wind lashes trees and pulls boards off roofs. Myanmar's military information office says the storm damaged houses, electrical transformers, phone towers, boats and lampposts in Sittwe, Kyaukpyu, and Gwa townships. It says the storm also tore roofs off of sport buildings on the Coco Islands.",

It's the second time in less than three months that Morant has been seen on social media holding what appeared to be a weapon. The first led to an eight-game suspension which cost Morant about $US669,000 ($1 million) in salary. It's unclear what sanctions he might face for the second video. The Grizzlies, who are now out of the NBA playoffs, say Morant is suspended from all team activities \"pending league review\". The NBA says it is aware of the new video and is \"gathering more information\".",
