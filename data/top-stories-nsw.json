As predicted, the Matildas have struggled to find a point of attack thanks to the absence of captain Sam Kerr. Caitlin Foord has stepped into the centre-forward role, but she's barely had a touch of the ball in this opening half-hour. The real woman of the hour for Australia has been Katrina Gorry : not only has she been spraying line-breaking passes left and right, but she's been doing the dirty, ugly work off the ball like tackles, intercepts, and wrestling the ball back into her possession when the Matildas are under pressure. At one point, she was the last defender muscling off Republic of Ireland 's centre-forward, and at another point she was sprinting towards their goalkeeper, trying to close down a clearance. She's been absolutely everywhere, and will be the reason the team gets a result tonight â€” if they do!",
