The nine-member jury in Manhattan federal court awarded Ms Carroll about $US5 million ($7.4 million) in compensatory and punitive damages. Although the finding of sexual abuse was enough to establish his liability for battery, the jury did not find that Mr Trump raped her, as it was also alleged. After the verdict, Ms Carroll said her victory was \"not just for me but for every woman who has suffered because she was not believed\". In an all-capital-letters post on social media, Mr Trump said the verdict was a \"disgrace\", and was quick to flag that he would be appealing against the verdict.",
