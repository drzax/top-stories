Next up is Nate Caddy, perhaps the most eye-catching of this year's crop. With his glowing blonde hair and hulking frame, Caddy was impossible to miss on the field as he got around with Vic Metro and the Northern Knights. His footy backed up the attention though, as he starred as a mobile forward who could push up the ground and even have stints in midfield. Caddy's athletic gifts are obvious — his frame is massive, but he covers the ground exceptionally well — and his skills improved as the year progressed. Caddy has worked hard on his goalkicking in particular, and with his impressive tank and work rate is able to get up the field to make his presence felt while still rolling back to hit the scoreboard. He's still a bit untidy, a bit of a bull at a gate sometimes, but clubs will love his infectious energy. Expect Caddy to be a top 10 pick, and expect him to see AFL footy early in 2023 as his body is as ready as a first-year player's can get.",

It was a mostly red day for the sectors, with only energy and basic materials seeing some positive movement — they picked up +0.6% and +0.5% respectively. Industrials and technology stocks were the biggest losers, falling by -1.8% and -1.4% each, followed by consumer cyclicals (-1%), academic and educational services (-0.7%), real estate (-0.7%), financials (-0.6%) and utilities (-0.5%). Healthcare and consumer non-cyclicals were flat. The general negative sentiment on the ASX follows the heightened risk that's affecting global markets stemming from the Israel-Gaza war. That has investors nervous about how it's going to affect the economy, and the oil price is seeing those nerves play out in real time. Right now, oil is sitting above $US90 a barrel, as anxiety continues to grow about the prospect of the war spreading beyond Israel and Hamas into the wider Middle East region. It's not just oil that's seeing fluctuations from the war — it's also driving up the price of gold, which has had a substantial effect on gold miners when it comes to the best performers on the local sharemarket today. The top movers for the day were: Regis Resources +5.8% West African Resources +4.9% Perseus Mining +4.4% Gold Road Resources +4.3% Capricorn Metals +3.7% And the bottom movers: Fletcher Building -8.6% Reliance Worldwide -4.6% Telix Pharmaceuticals -4.6% Block -4.5% Megaport -4.3%",

Milk tanker drivers plan to stop work in eastern Victoria from 3am tomorrow, while hundreds of dairy factory workers are planning to strike for 48 hours from Wednesday. The strike would mean \"no processing\" at 14 sites across the state, including at Leongatha, Longwarry and Darnum in eastern Victoria, Warrnambool in the south-west, along with Kiewa, Cobden, Tangambalanga, Stanhope and Cobram in the north, plus Mulgrave and Laverton in Melbourne. Factory workers who are members of the United Workers Union are calling for wage increases of 5% per year for three years. \"This is the biggest dairy action in living memory, it's never happened on this scale,\" said United Workers Union secretary, Tim Kennedy.

Representatives from Chevron and the Offshore Alliance appeared before the Fair Work Commission last week in a bid to work through terms of an in-principle deal for workers at its Wheatstone and Gorgon gas facilities reached in September. But over the weekend, the Offshore Alliance, a collaboration between the Australian Workers' Union and the Maritime Union of Australia, held a secret ballot where 91% of the 410 members that took part supported the strike action. A spokesman from Chevron described the move as \"extremely disappointing\" and said it went against advice given to the union by the Fair Work Commissioner, Bernie Riordan. But the Offshore Alliance has accused Chevron of backing away from the recommendations of FWC and failing to provide clarity on some terms of the agreement. Chevron's two facilities in the Pilbara supply about 7% of the world's supply of LNG and about 44% of WA's domestic supply.
