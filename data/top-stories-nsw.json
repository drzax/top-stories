              "plaintext": "Wayne Barnes of England is today's referee, the world's most capped official rewarded for another good tournament with the whistle. Barnes, 44, has officiated in 110 Tests since taking charge of Fiji vs Samoa in Suva in June 2006. He is the second Englishman to take charge of a Rugby World Cup final. The last Englishman to do so? Ed Morrison. When did he officiate a final? 1995, the last time New Zealand and South Africa met in the decider. The match will be Barnes's record 27th Rugby World Cup contest in what is his fifth tournament. It's his sixth match in the middle during France 2023 - he has refereed New Zealand twice - in their quarterfinal win over Ireland and their 73-0 thrashing of Uruguay in the pool stages. He has not refereed South Africa in an international since November 12, 2022, when the Boks lost to France 30-26 in Marseille. Barnes sent Pieter-Steph du Toit off after just 12 minutes, before levelling the sides at 14 men each with Antoine Dupont was also shown a red card. Sir Bill Beaumont, World Rugby chairman, praised Barnes for his longevity. \"On behalf of World Rugby, I would like to congratulate Wayne Barnes on his deserved appointment as the Rugby World Cup 2023 final referee,\" Sir Bill said. \"Such an appointment is a reflection of Wayne’s calibre, not just at this tournament but over a distinguished career. \"It is a result of his devotion to the game, the support of his family and the spirit of collaboration and excellence that exists across our entire match official team.\" World Rugby High Performance 15s Match Official Manager Joël Jutge said: \"Wayne’s ability to read and understand the game is second to none. He also embodies the passion, professionalism and dedication that is at the heart of a superb team of match officials at this Rugby World Cup.\". Karl Dickson and Matthew Carley (both England) are the assistant referees, while Tom Foley is the Television Match Official.",
