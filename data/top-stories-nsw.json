But the Victorian Labor Party's rules actually state that when choosing a new leader, nominations are open for three days. They also state that someone who's in the running for the top job can't be the interim leader during that time. But state political reporter Bridget Rollason says she's hearing some Labor MPs are keen to override those rules today, so they can lock in a leader with a minimum of drama. \"We reckon the caucus can vote to overrule the party rules if there is only one nomination tomorrow to get it done,\" one senior Labor figure told her. So in short, we don't know for sure — nominations may run for a few days, or we could see a new Labor leader before dinner.",
