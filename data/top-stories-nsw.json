              "plaintext": "It seems that the pendulum has finally started turning between profits and wages, with business earnings up a meek 0.5% in the first quarter, while wages and salaries rose 1.8%. Things weren't quite as subdued as they look for most businesses though, with a 2.2 per cent slide in mining profits on the back of falling commodity prices more than offset by a 3.3 per cent jump for non-mining industries. \"Of the non mining industries, professional and businesses services (our grouping of ABS data) was the biggest contributor to the strong result with profits up by 6.5% in the quarter,\" wrote CBA economist Stephen Wu. \"Also providing a solid boost was transport (+10.1%), manufacturing (+5.0%) and construction (+2.9%) .\" Perhaps the construction industry's \"profitless boom\" is finally coming to an end? Although it's likely the second word in that phrase, \"boom\", is also likely to end shortly with residential building approvals tumbling to decade lows. But, while many businesses continued to increase earnings, those reliant on more discretionary consumer spending seem to be coming off the post-COVID boil. \"In addition to mining, profits in wholesale trade ( 4.5%), retail trade ( 2.1%) and accommodation and food services ( 14.0%) saw falls in the quarter,\" added Mr Wu. \"These three industries are reliant on consumer spending and may point to emerging weakness. \"Delving a little deeper into the 'other' category that we report on, profits in the recreation industry were down by 7.9% in the quarter .\" This may also be reflected in rising inventories, which are going to add to economic growth in the first quarter but can be a sign of weakness if they are the result of lower than expected sales. \"Wholesale trade and accommodation & food services inventories are well above their average stock levels in 2019 (+13, 15%). Retail trade inventory is close to its 2019 average levels,\" observed Mr Wu. The 1.8% March quarter rise in the ABS measure of wages and salaries was much stronger than the 0.8% increase in the wage price index for the same period. The difference is that the broader measure published today captures the effects of population growth (more people working more hours), promotions, pay rises from changing roles or employers, and bonuses. \"The biggest rise in wages paid came in education (+4.4%). Also recording solid growth was health (+3.3%), information technology (+3.2%) and utilities (+2.1%) ,\" wrote Mr Wu from CBA. \" Real estate services was the only industry to record negative growth in the quarter, down 0.4%.\" I can just see your tears falling for the real estate agents who saw their commissions drop amid low levels of listings and sales over the first quarter. Overall, over the past year, the amount of money going to workers was up 11.4%, although this still fell short of the 14% increase in profits economy-wide over the same period.",

The supermarket giants are in court after joint trial was brought by the Fair Work Ombudsman and two class action claimants, alleging that workers have been underpaid for a number of years. In his opening address, Fair Work Ombudsman barrister Justin Bourke KC argued the \"entirely foreign\" payment structure covering some workers would always \"end badly for Woolworths and Coles and its employees\". He took Justice Nye Perram to the relevant award, arguing work hours were set at a total of 38 rostered hours per week, before contending that was not what happened in reality. In an \"extreme\" example, Mr Bourke said one team manager in Sydney was working 13 hours a day. Other workers were doing average shifts of nearly 11 hours, he said. He said evidence would show clear standards had to be met by the companies, and that there was tacit approval of the alleged illegal conduct, submitting they knew people were working above rostered hours \"day in day out\". There were failures on the use of \"informal\" rosters, time off in lieu, and record keeping on worker overtime, penalties and allowances, he said. \"No one blew a whistle,\" Mr Bourke said. \"They knew it was going on and they have to pay for it.\" The trial is expected to run for seven weeks.",
