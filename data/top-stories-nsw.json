A NASA spacecraft will fly by Earth on Sunday and drop off what is expected to be at least a cupful of rubble it grabbed from the asteroid Bennu, closing out a seven-year quest. The sample capsule will parachute into the Utah desert, US, as its mothership, the Osiris-Rex spacecraft, zooms off for an encounter with another asteroid. Scientists anticipate getting about 250 grams of pebbles and dust, much more than the teaspoon or so brought back by Japan from two other asteroids. No other country has fetched pieces of asteroids. These preserved time capsules from the dawn of our solar system could help explain how Earth — and life — came to be. University of Arizona’s Dante Lauretta is the mission’s lead scientist. “I ask myself how many heart-pounding moments can you have in one lifetime because I feel like I might be hitting my limit,” she says.",

He’s had remarkable business success, but also been criticised over episodes such as the UK phone-hacking scandal and Fox News’s role in promoting rigged-election conspiracies. Former prime ministers Kevin Rudd and Malcolm Turnbull are among those who’ve called for a Murdoch Royal Commission to investigate how News Corp wields its power in Australia. NPR journalist David Folkenflik, who wrote the book Murdoch’s World, says the retirement isn’t completely unexpected, given Rupert Murdoch’s age and the way he’s been grooming his son for several years. “One can understand why a 92-year-old billionaire might finally step away and leave things in the hands of his designated successor,” he told the ABC’s North America bureau chief Jade Macmillan. “But… it does take you aback – it's a moment to reflect, It's a moment to register all that he has done, his incredible successes, his extraordinary record and, you know, the wreckage he left in his wake as well.”",

He went from a meeting with young athletes in a working-class, multicultural suburb of Paris to an emotional stop in front of the fire-damaged Notre Dame Cathedral. Charles and Queen Camilla, accompanied by French President Emmanuel Macron and his wife, Brigitte, listened to a presentation about ongoing renovation work at Notre-Dame. The day before the king said he had been “utterly appalled by the scenes of such devastation following the catastrophic fire” in April 2019. Charles and Camilla weren't able to enter the cathedral for safety reasons, but French president Macron invited them to take a closer look at the entrance as dozens of workers on the higher floors of the monument applauded the king and took pictures. The cathedral is due to reopen at the end of next year.",
