Many now argue that the material change clause that's been inserted into the dialogue looks to have been triggered and the RBA has little option but to follow through.

              "plaintext": "Economists say an increase in interest rates is likely when the Reserve Bank board holds its monthly meeting today. Between May 2022 and June this year, the RBA have increased the cash rate to 4.1% — up from its record low level of 0.1% during the pandemic — but have held it steady since. Chief economist at HSBC, Paul Bloxham, says inflation has not been coming down as quickly as the central bank wants — which makes another rate rise necessary. \"We think they will lift interest rates ... by 25 basis points,\" he said. \"We also think that they ought to, that we need to lift interest rates, financial conditions need to be tightened further as inflation is still a primary challenge and it's still too high in Australia.\" Commsec market analyst, Laura Beserati, says inflation remains a concern. \"We have been hearing a hiking bias from the new governor Michele Bullock, but interestingly according to market pricing its a 50-50 chance that it could go either way,\" she said. \"Most analysts expect rates to go up and our view here at CBA is that interest rates will increase by 25 basis points.\" Brian Redican, chief economist at NSW Treasury Corporation (TCorp) says a rate hike by the RBA will hurt households already on the brink. \"The Reserve Bank's own research suggests that somewhere between 5 and 15% of people with a mortgage are actually spending more than they're actually earning at the moment,\" he said. \"Obviously that's not sustainable and how they react to another potential rate hike could potentially be quite extreme.\"",
