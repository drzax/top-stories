Qantas announced this morning that Mr Joyce would bring forward his retirement by two months to help the company \"accelerate its renewal\" after a turbulent week for the airline. That includes a lawsuit by the competition regulator which alleges that Qantas sold tickets that had been cancelled. Mr Thomas told ABC News Channel that it was time for Mr Joyce to go. \"He's the face of the airline.\" \"And he's been a lightning rod for all the problems of the airline.\" \"And so, with the latest ACCC allegations which have been brought into court, I think it was time for Alan to move on simply so that the focus could be taken away from him and let the airline deal with the issues it has to, without him being the focal point of all the criticism.\" Mr Thomas also thinks the Qantas board will take a look at Mr Joyce's multi million dollar salary and considering docking some of his bonuses. \"These bonuses are eye-watering, particularly when the airline is having all these problems and passengers' flights have been disrupted, there's all sorts of allegations flying around.\" \"I'm sure the board and the shareholders will look at the remuneration and they may make some adjustments to it.\" He says the new chief executive Vanessa Hudson faces alot of issues including updating the Qantas fleet. \"Vanessa Hudson - who is now the CEO as of tomorrow - is the person who guided Qantas through the COVID pandemic, and she will be focused on shareholder value.\" \"So the challenge for Vanessa going forward will be to maintain shareholder value while competing against airlines that either are government-owned or have far, far lower labour costs, like Indonesia.\" \"And also, she has to oversee the biggest fleet overhaul Qantas has ever had.\" \"That's going to be very challenging over the next three years.\" \"So there's lots of obstacles for her.\" Here's more from my colleagues Gareth Hutchens and Kate Ainsworth.",
