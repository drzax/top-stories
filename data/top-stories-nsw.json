Capital Economics Australian and New Zealand economist Abhijit Surya says it was a surprise to no one. \"The RBNZ's decision to leave its official cash rate on hold at 5.5 per cent was widely expected.\" \"The minutes of the July meeting reinforce our view that the bank's tightening cycle is over.\" Mr Surya says the central bank noted higher interest rates were \"constraining domestic spending as expected\" in a nod to the recession caused by the steep hike in official rates. And he suggest that rate cuts could be on the cards next year. \"Although the bank implied that rate cuts would be unlikely before the second half of 2024, we think the combination of a deepening recession and easing price pressures will pave the way for an easing cycle as early as Q1 2024 (the first quarter of next year).",

Here's how he answered: \"It is not having a direct influence  but through a couple of channels the fact that there are a lot more  people coming into the country has eased pressures and some labour  markets, particularly, in the  hospitality sector because a lot of the increase in population over six months has been students. They often work in hospitality sector. \"Our  liaison with firms in that sector  say it is easy to get workers and  has taken some of the heat out of  that labour market. That works in  the short term to put inflation  down, on the other hand, all these people coming in have to live  somewhere. \"That is pushing up rents and housing prices and with your  housing prices would continue to  decline this year but they are not. In Sydney, the rising quite strongly again. And that is partly to the  influx of immigration. \"There are  pluses and minuses in terms of  inflation outlook. Helping contain wages growth that [is] putting upward pressure on  rates. But we talk about it and the bank, if we're going to have a lot more people the country, which is  good, we need the capital stock to support those people. \"Otherwise the capital-labour ratio declines and  that is bad for productivity, so  population growth brings huge  advantages to the contrary but we  need governments and businesses to keep investing to build a capital  stock to support a stronger  population. \"The housing market is  the clearest example of that but  there are a lot of other examples as well. \"It is a broader issue than  just the short-term inflation  outlook it is how we build the  capital stock to support a larger or diverse population which I think is in long-term interest.\"",
