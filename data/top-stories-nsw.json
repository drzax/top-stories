As you will see, Wall Street ended in the red and the futures for Australian markets show we will likely follow. The CPI data shows that price hikes aren't over in the world's biggest economy, with headline rising above consensus estimates by 0.3% a month and core inflation about the same. That, of course, is creating concern that the US federal reserve will raise rates again to tackle price spikes. This note from CBA this morning: Notwithstanding, we doubt the downtrend in inflation has been thrown off course.  The outlook for the US consumer is poor given the resumption of student loan repayments, lower government benefit payments, and the erosion of pandemic savings.  At the same time, interest rates on consumer loans have risen sharply to very high levels.  Indeed, some FOMC officials have recently said the rise in yields may substitute for further FOMC tightening.  Our baseline remains for the FOMC to keep the Funds rate steady into early 2024.  We consider the FOMC’s significant policy tightening will lead the global economy into recession. Recession fears are also being sparked by the devastating crisis in the Middle East. Here is a piece by our business reporter Nassim Khadem to get you started this morning.",

The outlook for the US consumer is poor given the resumption of student loan repayments, lower government benefit payments, and the erosion of pandemic savings.  At the same time, interest rates on consumer loans have risen sharply to very high levels.  Indeed, some FOMC officials have recently said the rise in yields may substitute for further FOMC tightening.  Our baseline remains for the FOMC to keep the Funds rate steady into early 2024.  We consider the FOMC’s significant policy tightening will lead the global economy into recession."

From all reports, the Hawks are a bit surprised by this as well and haven't exactly been preparing for it. If Hawthorn are interested in bringing him back, I can't see them offering a whole lot to make it happen. Last year the Lions payed pick 48 and a future fourth for him. I doubt the Hawks will even go that far this time around. Whether that means Gunston stays in Brisbane or if another Victorian club tries to get involved remains to be seen.",
