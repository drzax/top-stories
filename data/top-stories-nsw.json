England were starting to get back into the game in that second half, but that silly mistake from Lauren James means the Lionesses are really up against it as we go another 30 minutes in Brisbane. James has been at the heart of everything England have tried so far in this game and, indeed, that they've done well this tournament. In the Men's World Cup of 1998 David Beckham was similarly sent off against Argentina in a knockout clash. This might well be this team's - and Lauren James's own personal - Beckham moment. Nigeria were slightly less effective in that half as the fatigue started to set in, but nevertheless, the Super Falcons will feel like they have a superb opportunity to become the first African team to win a knockout game at the Women's World Cup.",
