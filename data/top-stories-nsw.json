The Australian building materials producer, which is heavily focused on the US market, reported falling first quarter sales (-5% to $US954 million) but an increased underlying profit. The company's adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) jumped 12% to $US279 million. The reason? A massive growth in profit margins. The company's adjusted EBITDA margin jumped from 24.9 to 29.2% over the past year. Both the company's US and Asia-Pacific fiber cement divisions posted record EBIT profit margins of 31.1% and 33.1% respectively. Those margins jumped 5.4 percentage points in the US and 7.5 percentage points in the Asia-Pacific region since its first quarter results a year ago. Slumping volumes saw the company's European building products division report a decrease in earnings, with rising costs keeping margins stagnant despite a steep rise in prices. Overall, the company ended up reporting a small (-3%) fall in its statutory net profit, which came in at $US157.8 million ($240 million).",

Investors are worried because he's been seen as a possible successor to Tesla founder Elon Musk. Reuters reports that his departure has raised concerns about a succession plan at the world's most valuable carmaker. Tesla shares fell 3.5 per cent on the news. And US stocks had a good night after last week's sell-off, with the S & P 500 and the Nasdaq ending four days of losses. Warren Buffet's investment firm Berkshire Hathaway jumped to a record high after the company reported its quarterly operating profit topped $US10 billion ($15.2 billion) for the first time. Later this week, the US consumer price index will be released, a key piece of information for the US Federal Reserve and its next move on interest rates. US consumer prices saw their smallest annual increase in two years in June. Coming up today, we will get a reading of consumer confidence from Westpac and the Melbourne Institute and the National Australia Bank releases its latest business confidence survey. And building materials maker James Hardie reports its first quarter profit. Grab a coffee and let's go.",
