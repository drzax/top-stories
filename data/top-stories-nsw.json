Negotiations have been underway since 2018 into ways Australian producers can export agricultural products into the European market, which the EU has pushed back against. The EU has also threatened the right of Australian producers to use names such as \"prosecco\" and \"feta\" due to its strict \"geographic indicators\". Trade Minister Don Farrell travelled to Brussels this week in an attempt to break the deadlock, but he says Australia could not accept the deal that was offered. \"My job is to get the best result for Australia.\" \"We weren't able to achieve that on this occasion.\" The National Farmers Federation says it supports the Australian government's decision to continue working on the deal. NFF chief executive Tony Mahar say he applauds Senator Farrell and the negotiating team for \"rejecting a sub-standard deal\". \"We're hopeful that with some grit and goodwill from both sides we can get this thing done in a way that benefits everyone, including Aussie farmers,\" Mr Mahar says. \"Australia should not have to accept a deal which is inferior to that of other countries.\" Here's more from political reporter Chantelle Al-Khouri.",
