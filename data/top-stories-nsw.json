They talk about this being an invitation from First Nations people. But it's not an invitation from First Nations people,\" he said. Mr Stewart-Assheton said that he hopes a No result on Saturday will mean \"proper conversations\" about \"land rights, self-determination and sovereignty\". But he said that regardless of outcome, First Nations people had been \"thrown under the bus\" by the referendum. \"It's still going to be detrimental for First Nations people. Either we're going to have a tokenistic advisory body which undermines our struggle or we'll end up with a racist outcome over what's deemed as a racist \"no\". \"Either way, First Nations people won't be helped by this referendum. We need to look beyond this referendum and look at organising properly to get some proper land rights and proper gains towards self-determination.\"",

Just over 2 million have applied for a postal vote. We've had about 110,000 Australians through mobile polling, about another 25,000 through remote polling and about 40,000 overseas already as well, so big numbers,\" he said. \"We're expecting a big turnout today for the last day of pre-poll voting.\" Commissioner Rogers also made one last plea for Australians to remain civil when they head to the polls tomorrow. \"99 per cent of the public and the campaigners are being fine, perfect, polite. It is a very, very small number who are creating grief and we're urging civility. It's the most important thing. And may I just, while I'm here, thank all of our staff on behalf of all of Australians,\" he said.",

There's nothing to fear here,\" he said. \"I sincerely hope that Australians find it in their heart, but also in their head to know that we can't just do more of the same and that Australians vote Yes tomorrow.\" Albanese says he's hopeful that Australia's \"generosity of spirit' will show at the polls tomorrow. \"For 97 per cent of Australians, this will have no impact on their lives whatsoever. Parliament's not going to change. The decision-making power is not going to change. Just recognition of the First Australians in our nation's founding document. If not now, when are we going to get around to doing that?\" he said.",

As you will see, Wall Street ended in the red and the futures for Australian markets show we will likely follow. The CPI data shows that price hikes aren't over in the world's biggest economy, with headline rising above consensus estimates by 0.3% a month and core inflation about the same. That, of course, is creating concern that the US federal reserve will raise rates again to tackle price spikes. This note from CBA this morning: Notwithstanding, we doubt the downtrend in inflation has been thrown off course.  The outlook for the US consumer is poor given the resumption of student loan repayments, lower government benefit payments, and the erosion of pandemic savings.  At the same time, interest rates on consumer loans have risen sharply to very high levels.  Indeed, some FOMC officials have recently said the rise in yields may substitute for further FOMC tightening.  Our baseline remains for the FOMC to keep the Funds rate steady into early 2024.  We consider the FOMC’s significant policy tightening will lead the global economy into recession. Recession fears are also being sparked by the devastating crisis in the Middle East. Here is a piece by our business reporter Nassim Khadem to get you started this morning.",

The outlook for the US consumer is poor given the resumption of student loan repayments, lower government benefit payments, and the erosion of pandemic savings.  At the same time, interest rates on consumer loans have risen sharply to very high levels.  Indeed, some FOMC officials have recently said the rise in yields may substitute for further FOMC tightening.  Our baseline remains for the FOMC to keep the Funds rate steady into early 2024.  We consider the FOMC’s significant policy tightening will lead the global economy into recession."
