There aren't as many homes for sale as usual, but enough people are competing for them to keep pushing prices higher nationally. So just who is buying them? ABC business reporter Nassim Khadem has found migrants, retirees and first home buyers relying on 'the bank of mum and dad' haven't been deterred by the recent market conditions. Take the Lindemans, for example — they are part of a group of property buyers using cash rather than taking out a home loan, so they're not directly affected by mortgage rate rises. \"We're empty nesters looking to downsize… It's certainly a huge relief. And it's nice to get the property within the range we were sort of looking at,\" Thomas Lindeman says. Settlement data from PEXA shows there have been fewer buyers requiring a home loan, meaning that cash buyers — the majority of which were older Australians looking to downsize or retire — have increased as proportion of overall sales. \"This speaks to the distribution effects of the interest rate changes that we've seen, because this group is largely unaffected by interest rates when they're making those decisions to move,\" PEXA chief economist Julie Toth says.

The company says it self-identified and reported a breach in one of its product disclosure statements to the regulator back in 2021. \"While the Fund was managed by Vanguard in alignment with the Index methodology, Vanguard identified that the descriptions of the exclusionary screens published by the Index provider and within Vanguard’s Product Disclosure Statement (PDS) were not sufficiently detailed,\" it says. \"At the time, the description of the exclusionary screens did not provide a sufficiently detailed explanation that certain debt issuers lacking research coverage were still included in the benchmark. \"As a result, it is possible the portfolio held exposure to certain securities that may not have been reasonably expected by investors.\" Vanguard says it moved quickly to inform investors and improve its PDS, and has fully cooperated with ASIC. \"There was never any intention to mislead, but Vanguard recognises it has not lived up to the high standards it holds itself accountable to and apologises for the concern this matter may cause for our clients.\" In the two years since, Vanguard says it's appointed a head of ESG Product, added more resources to its disclosure and oversight teams, and enhanced its processes. As of December, Vanguard has paid nearly $40,000 in infringement notices issued by ASIC over alleged greenwashing.",

It's brought the case over allegations of greenwashing — ASIC says Vanguard engaged in misleading conduct by making claims about certain environmental, social and governance exclusionary screens applied to investments in a Vanguard fund. The regulator alleges that false statements were made in relation to Vanguard Ethically Conscious Global Aggregate Bond Index Fund and how the securities in the fund were screened according to certain ESG criteria. ASIC is arguing that ESG research was not conducted over a significant proportion of issuers of bonds in an index the fund was based on, and therefore the Vanguard fund itself. \"We know that investors are increasingly seeking investment options that exclude certain industries, and investors need to be able to rely on investment screens to help them make these choices,\" ASIC deputy chair Sarah Court said. \"In this case, Vanguard promised its investors and potential investors that the product would be screened to exclude bond issuers with significant business activities in certain industries, including fossil fuels. \"We consider that the screening and research undertaken on behalf of Vanguard was far more limited than that being promised to investors, and we consider this constitutes another example of greenwashing.\" ASIC and the consumer watchdog ACCC have been cracking down on greenwashing activity in recent months. Vanguard has been contacted for comment.",
