In March, the former ATO employee lost his bid to be declared immune from prosecution on 24 offences stemming from his decision to go public on what he claims were unethical tactics used by his former employer to collect debts. His plight has highlighted the stark difference in justice meted out to those acting alone as opposed to those protected by the veil of the corporate world. Ironically, Mr Boyle's Federal Court decision came just weeks after Peter Collins, the former senior tax partner at accounting giant PwC, was barred from practising by the Tax Practitioners Board. His misdeed? It was discovered that in 2014, Mr Collins had shared confidential tax information with other partners and staff about a federal government initiative to clamp down on multinational tax avoidance. Ever since the Tax Practitioners Board decision in January, the firm has been desperately trying to contain the damage, hosing down concerns from within and outside the firm. But to no avail. In the past fortnight, the firm has been plunged into a crisis that threatens its very future in Australia. For more on this, here's the latest analysis from business editor Ian Verrender :",

It's a significant boost that could prompt Chinese and South Korean regulators to follow suit — despite UK regulators blocking the deal. It has until May 24 to appeal a decision by Britain's Competition & Markets Authority (CMA) to block it. A final decision may take months. The US Federal Trade Commission's case against the deal is also pending at the agency, though Japan approved it in March. The European Commission said the transaction was pro-competition due to Microsoft's agreement to licence popular Activision games such as \"Call of Duty\" to rival game streaming platforms. Such licences are \"practical and effective\", Europen Union antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager told reporters. \"Actually they significantly improve the condition for cloud game streaming compared to the present situation, which is why we actually consider them pro-competitive,\" she added, contrasting with the UK position that the deal would hit competition in that part of the market. In rejecting the deal, the UK watchdog was seen as flexing its muscle on the global regulatory stage since Brexit. Microsoft has in recent months signed licensing deals with Nvidia, Nintendo, Ukraine's Boosteroid and Japan's Ubitus to bring Activision games to their platforms should the deal go through. \"The European Commission has required Microsoft to license popular Activision Blizzard games automatically to competing cloud gaming services,\" said Microsoft President Brad Smith. \"This will apply globally and will empower millions of consumers worldwide to play these games on any device they choose.\" Activision's shares closed 1.2% higher, while Microsoft's were little changed.",
