Stephen Richardson from the Tasmania Fire Service says patrols are continuing. \"We still have to continue to monitor the fire in and around those properties because there's not enough rain to extinguish the fire at this point,\" he says. He says smoke from the fire extended across parts of the Tasmanian mainland, including Launceston and Deloraine .",

At least 650 firefighters are battling hot and windy weather conditions, with a cool change not expected until later this afternoon. A fire at Loch Sport jumped the Longford-Loch Sport Road and has burned 3,000 hectares. Electricity to the town has been cut and the only access in and out of the area has been closed. Incident controller Andy Gillan says it is too late to leave. \"Those Loch Sport people please remain vigilant, shelter in place, enact your fire plans and if you're feeling uncomfortable in Loch Sport we encourage you to head down to the Marina Hotel. \" You can keep up to date with the Gippsland fires here.",

CBS's The Late Show With Stephen Colbert, ABC's Jimmy Kimmel Live! and NBC's T he Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon were the first shows to leave the air when the writers strike began on May 2, and now will be among the first to return on Monday night. Comedian John Oliver got his first take on the strike out, exuberantly returning Sunday night to his Last Week Tonight show on HBO and delivering full-throated support for the strike. Oliver cheerily delivered a recap of stories from the last five months before getting serious, calling the strike \"an immensely difficult time\" for all those in the industry. \"To be clear, this strike happened for good reasons. Our industry has seen its workers severely squeezed in recent years,\" Oliver said. \"So, the writers guild went to strike and thankfully won. But, it took a lot of sacrifices from a lot of people to achieve that. \"I am also furious that it took the studios 148 days to achieve a deal they could have offered on day one,\" Oliver said. He added that he hopes the writers contract would give leverage to other entertainment industry guilds – as well as striking car workers and employees in other industries – to negotiate better deals. Network late-night hosts will have their returns later on Monday. The writers were allowed to return to work last week after the Writers Guild of America reached an agreement on a three-year contract with an alliance of the industry's biggest studios, streaming services and production companies.

                "plaintext": "Share market across the world have performed quite badly in the past three months. Several major indexes posted their biggest quarterly (and monthly) losses all year: So what's causing investors to get spooked? One factor is the comments that central bank officials, worldwide have made about the interest rate outlook. Earlier today, Federal Reserve Vice Chair for Supervision Michael Barr said he feels US rates are \"at or near\" a level that is sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation down to the Fed's 2% target. It is also likely, he told the Forecasters Club of New York, that rates will need to stay high for some time to bring inflation down to target, and he is confident the Fed will get that job done. Senior officials from the US, European, British and Australian central banks have recently made similar statements (reiterating that the next move on rates is \"data dependent\"), which aren't exactly groundbreaking. Investors are now beginning to take them more seriously, and are re-thinking their earlier expectations about rate cuts happening soon. Bond sell-off, stronger US greenback, weaker share markets So the \"higher for longer\" narrative has caused a sell-off in the government bond (or debt) market, which has pushed the US 10-year Treasury yield to its highest level in 16 years (around the time of the Global Financial Crisis). As the price of bonds fall, their yields go up (the price and yield move in opposite directions). It means the US government would need to pay higher interest, to entice more people to lend it money (by purchasing its Treasurey bonds). And that boosted the US dollar to its highest level since November last year (and weakened other currencies, like the Australian dollar, in the process). As more investors invest in the 'safe' greenback, they're pulling their money out of riskier assets (like the share market), which is why the ASX 200, S & P 500, Stoxx 600, Nikkei and other indexes suffered their worst quarters of the year.",

However, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commmission ( ACCC ) said today that it has \"significant preliminary competition concerns\", and that the deal could reduce competition for pathology services. ACL may need to sell off its approved collection centres (for pathology services) across the nation before the Healius buyout can be approved. \"We are now seeking feedback from stakeholders on whether the draft undertaking offered by ACL would be capable of addressing the competition concerns,\" ACCC commissioner Stephen Ridgeway said. The proposed buyout may involve ACL divesting 60 of its pathology collection centres in Perth, 25 across regional Victoria, and 14 in the Northern Territory (subject to a final decision by the regulator). Shares of Healius fell 2.4% to $2.23, while Australian Clinical Labs is down 1.4% to $2.76.",
