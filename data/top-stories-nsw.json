Bjorn Jarvis, the head of labour statistics with the ABS, said although employment fell by 15,000 people in July, it is still substantially higher than this time last year. \"The fall in employment follows an average monthly increase of around 42,000 people during the first half of this year. Employment is still around 387,000 people higher than last July ,\" he said. \"July includes the school holidays, and we continue to see some changes around when people take their leave and start or leave a job. \"It’s important to consider this when looking at month-to-month changes, compared with the usual seasonal pattern. The only other fall in employment in 2023 was in April, which also included school holidays. \"While unemployment increased by 36,000 people in July, to 541,000, it was still around 172,000 lower than before the pandemic .\" Mr Jarvis said the high participation rate of 66.8% coupled with an underemployment rate of 6.4% suggests the labour market is still experiencing tight conditions.",
