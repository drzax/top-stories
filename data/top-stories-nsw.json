ANZ's fall was leading a 0.7% decline across the financial sector. The other biggest loser on the ASX 200 is TPG Telecom, off 8.4% to $4.99 after the company pulled the plug on discussions with Vocus, which was looking to buy some of its enterprise, government and wholesale assets, including Vision Network. Unlike in the US, Australia's tech sector index was down 0.3%. Utilities, mining and energy were all in the black in early trade. Biggest gains: Elders +10% to $6.80 Boral +6.8% to $5.01 NIB Holdings +4.1% to $7.59 Light and Wonder +2.3% to $134.61 Incitec Pivot +2.2% to $2.965 Biggest losses: TPG Telecom -8.3% to $5 ANZ -3.3% to $24.635 Chalice Mining -2.8% to $1.59 Perseus Mining -2.6% to $1.695 Macquarie Group -2.5% to $158.62",

The Reserve Bank's former deputy governor Guy Debelle is spruiking the benefits of a speedier transition towards renewable energy in Australia. Dr Debelle has told an audience at the UBS Australasia Conference in Sydney that the nation's progess towards decarbonisation is still moving at a \"slow pace\" and has a \"long way to go\". He also says Australia has a comparative advantage -- over other nations -- which it is not taking full advantage of. By that, he means our access to sun and wind power (and the huge amounts of land to build those renewable energy plants). He says Australia has more than enough capacity to meet its own decarbonisation needs, while exporting that renewable energy to countries like Japan and South Korea. Despite the loss in fossil fuel revenues being \"expensive\", Dr Debelle said there is no other option than transition to renewables. \"The alternative is a hell of a lot more expensive. So if we don't have a habitable planet, that's going to be pretty damn costly.\"",

The shadow home affairs and cyber security minister James Paterson told Sky News this morning that he had spoken to the port operator. \"I was briefed by the company last night and they were hopeful that they would be able to restore normal operations in the next couple of days, and in the meantime what they are trying to do is build a parallel system that effectively allows the port to continue to operate, at least for those high-priority shipments in the meantime, so that doesn't have too adverse flow on consequences for our economy,\" he said. \"My understanding from the company is that they detected suspicious and unauthorised activity on their own networks at about 10am on Friday, and they took a precautionary measure to shut down their networks or effectively disconnect them from the internet so that whatever was happening couldn't proceed any further.\" Mr Paterson said he understands the company did not receive a ransom note, either because the attack was successfully disrupted or because the attacker was motivated by something other than financial gain. If you're just getting up to speed with the issues, political reporter Georgia Roberts had this story yesterday.",
