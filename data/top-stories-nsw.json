The report shows the reliance on the age pension will reduce, because of growing superannuation balances.

That's according to financial comparison website Finder. Finder says that would mean saving nearly $300,000 for a house deposit and $188,523 for a unit. Home loans expert at Finder, Richard Whitton, says many first home buyers simply can't afford to save such big deposits. “Wage growth over the past few decades simply hasn’t kept up with skyrocketing property prices. “Saving up enough for a deposit, especially when the cost of everything from food, energy, and insurance – not to mention rent – is rising, is a big barrier to overcome. “Buying a home is becoming increasingly out of reach for many Aussies.” New South Wales is the most expensive place to buy with households need to save for 20 years on average for a house deposit of $470,660. You can see why many people will never be able to get on the property ladder. The Northern Territory and Western Australia were the best places to save for a home deposit, with NT households needing to save for an average of 8 years for a $151,584 house deposit.",
