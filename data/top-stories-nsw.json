Israel blockaded the territory and launched waves of punishing air strikes following the October 7 terrorist attack by Hamas militants on towns in southern Israel. Many in Gaza, reduced to eating one meal a day and without enough water to drink, are waiting desperately for the aid. Hospital workers were also in urgent need of medical supplies and fuel for their generators as they treat huge numbers of people wounded in the bombings. More than 200 trucks carrying roughly 3,000 tons (2721 tonnes) of aid had been positioned near the crossing for days waiting to head into Gaza.

The flight landed from Dubai, following a flight from Tel Aviv to Dubai with 99 passengers on board. In a post today on X, formerly Twitter, Foreign Affairs Minister Penny Wong said more than 1,800 previously registered Australians had now left Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories, including the West Bank. Today's aircraft is understood to be the final Australian government-assisted flight out of Israel for the foreseeable future. Only about six of the 99 passengers were returning home to Perth, according to Perth Airport.",
