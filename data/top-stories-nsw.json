Speaking to Radio National's David Lipson, Mr Sarhan said whatever aid was coming into Gaza now was just \"window dressing\". \"We're having a grave situation in Gaza now — doctors (have) started doing surgeries without anaesthetics and without antibiotics … people are being tortured to have surgeries without anaesthetics — it's a very bad situation,\" he said. \"People there are dying by the hundreds every day and the death has reached a level that they can't even bring their dead out from the rubble … they don't have equipment to get the dead out. They don't even have body bags to bury them, it's turning into an open graveyard.\" He said aid agencies were angry and frustrated at how long it was taking to help the people of Gaza, with many unable to operate safely. \"The killing has to stop … if the ceasefire happens and the killing stops, aid will have a meaning, but right now it's a complete mess there.

But one stock defying the recent gloom is Weebit Nano, which develops \"advanced semiconductor memory technology\". It's the ASX 200's top gainer by far today up 16.2% to $4.37, and has gained around 50% over the past four trading sessions. It all began with a 6.9% jump to $3.11 on Wednesday, a day before it put out a market update pre-open on Thursday morning announcing a major deal for South Korean foundry DB HiTek to licence its technology on chips. It then rose a further 6.8% on Thursday and 13.3% on Friday. Based in Israel and France, the company had previously updated the market on October 10 to assure investors that its operations would be unaffected by the Israel-Gaza war, with its lab currently unaffected and work-from-home contingency plans in place for its Israeli staff if needed. The other biggest gains as of the middle of the trading day are: ARB Corporation +4% to $31.46 Insignia Financial +2.7% to $2.095 Resmed +2.4% to $23.18 Fisher and Paykel Healthcare +1.9% to $19.29 The biggest losers (amongst many) are: New Hope Corporation -9% to $5.89 Pilbara Minerals -5.2% to $3.66 Mineral Resources -4.1% to $57.13 Alumina Ltd -4% to $0.7775 Coronado Global Resources -3.9% to $1.62 Overall, only a quarter of the ASX 200 companies were gaining ground, with 144 in the red and six flat. Healthcare (+1%) and consumer non-cyclicals (+0.4%) were the only sectors in the black. Energy (-2.4%) was down sharply, led by coal miners, while mining (-1.9%) and education (-1%) were also off steeply.",

              "plaintext": "The September quarter Consumer Price Index (CPI) from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) is going to be critical for the Reserve Bank's decision on whether it needs to raise interest rates at least once more, possibly as soon as November 7. So what are economists expecting to see at 11:30am AEDT this Wednesday when the ABS publishes CPI data for both the month and quarter of September? Westpac, which publishes a very detailed category-by-category breakdown of its forecast, is tipping both headline and 'trimmed mean' figures to come in at 1.1% for the quarter and 5.3 and 5% for the year, respectively. ( Trimmed mean is a key \"underlying\" measure of inflation preferred by the Reserve Bank because it excludes the most volatile price moves up and down). Westpac senior economist Justin Smirk says there are big uncertainties about just how much temporary electricity bill rebates and permanently increased childcare subsidies will offset price rises in those sectors, making forecasting harder than usual. \" Auto fuel is making the most significant contribution in the September quarter (+0.26ppt), closely followed by utilities (0.24ppt), food (0.17ppt), rents (0.13ppt), financial services (0.10ppt) and then dwelling purchases (0.09ppt).\" CBA's forecast for inflation is a little lower, at 0.9 and 1% for the headline and trimmed mean, respectively. It believes such a result would see the RBA sit tight in November. \"Our forecast for Q3 23 CPI is broadly similar to the RBA's implied profile from August. We believe this is consistent with monetary policy on hold in November.\" However, the bank's economists warn that the risks are to the upside for inflation, and a result much higher than forecast could see the RBA hike the cash rate by 0.25%pt next month. UBS's George Tharenou is forecasting an even higher 1.2%/1.1% headline/underlying result, which would add to pressure for a rate rise. ANZ's economists see the result as being 1.1/1.2% for headline and trimmed mean, which they say could see another rate hike. \"This outcome, particularly for trimmed mean, would cause the RBA some discomfort given its 'low tolerance for a slower return of inflation to target' than current forecasts. \"As we noted after the most recent minutes, risks of RBA action in the near-term appear to be rising. For now, we expect the cash rate to remain at 4.1%, although we'll ultimately make a call on the November Board meeting in the wake of the CPI.\" For what it's worth, the typical forecast according to a survey of economists by Reuters is for both headline and trimmed mean inflation to rise 1.1% in the quarter, or 5.3% and 5% up respectively over the past year. Financial markets are currently pricing in about a 30% chance of the RBA lifting the cash rate in a fortnight's time.",

The benchmark indices are down around 0.8% in early trade, with the ASX 200 at 6,845 points. Mining and energy are dominating the early falls, with real estate and consumer cyclical stocks also down on fears of an economic slowdown due to higher interest rates persisting for longer. In a clearly 'risk-off' day, the sectors posting solid gains are the more 'defensive' ones of consumer non-cyclicals and healthcare — the kinds of businesses we can't avoid when we're cutting spending. Treasury Wine Estates is one of the ASX 200's top gainers, up 3% to $12.12, after the Australian Government said China is undertaking a five month review into punitive wine tariffs, with a widespread expectation they will be removed early next year. The other top rises around 10:20am AEDT were: Weebit Nano +4% to $3.91 Bellevue Gold +3.7% to $1.555 BlueScope Steel +1.8% to $18.23 ARB Corp +1.8% to $30.81 The biggest falls were for: New Hope Corporation -7.7% to $5.97 Liontown Resources -3.7% to $1.83 Champion Iron -3.5% to $6.06 Pilbara Minerals -3.5% to $3.725 South32 -3% to $3.27",
