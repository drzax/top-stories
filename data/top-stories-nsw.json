The RBA kept official interest rates on hold at 4.1 per cent despite warning that inflation was too high. Here's more from Peter: The Reserve Bank board left official interest rates on hold a fortnight ago on fears that more hikes could trigger an unanticipated spike in unemployment by the end of the year. Minutes from the RBA Boardâs meeting on July 4 show concerns that higher interest rates would force households to save more and most likely impact a so-far resilient jobs market. âMembers observed there was considerable uncertainty about the resilience of household consumption,â the minutes say. âThe squeeze of many householdsâ finances would ... encourage households to save more which would affect consumption. âIf that were to occur, the demand for labour would slow and the unemployment rate would be likely to rise beyond the rate required to ensure inflation returns to target.â",
