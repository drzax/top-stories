The ASX rallied late morning after the RBA Governor made some comments to the Senate that yesterday's CPI data was in line with what they expected. I think it created a bit of hope that the bank will keep the cash rate on hold at 4.1 per cent next month. But then former RBA assistant governor, now chief economist at Westpac, Luci Ellis published a note saying she expects a rate hike on Melbourne Cup day - along with the other big four banks. Stocks went back down then mostly traded sideways through the afternoon - with a sharp little uptick just at the end - but it wasn't enough. The ASX 200 and the broader All Ordinaries Indices both ended the day about 0.6 per cent lower. The top 5 stocks today were: Super Retail Group + 4.59% Beach Energy +4.05% Iluka Resources +2.85% Paladin Energy + 2.59% Gold Road Resources +2.23% The bottom 5 stocks : Megaport -16.33% Block -8.02% Neuren Pharmaceuticals - 7.29% Light and Wonder -4.93% Bank of Queensland -4.74%",

The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) has put out the numbers today. The Export Price Index fell 3.1 per cent in the September quarter 2023, and fell 10.7 per cent during the year. A big driver was rural exports, which fell for the third consecutive quarter, down 7.1 per cent for the three months to September and down 16.8 per cent annually. Michelle Marquardt, ABS head of prices statistics, said: \"The annual fall in rural exports is the largest in this series since the December quarter 2009. Good seasonal conditions outside of Australia have improved global supply for a range of key agricultural exports, including coarse grains, oilseeds, beef and sheep meat, driving prices downward.\" Fertilisers and minerals were also down for the quarter (-29%) - driven by fall in lithium prices. Coal, coke and briquettes also fell (-11.3%). CBA Senior Economist Belinda Allen said this about imports, in a note after the data was released: \"On the import side, and the prices for goods imports rose by 0.8% in Q3 23. A move higher was expected given global oil prices. Less certain was the impact from a weaker Australian dollar. The main contributor to the rise was petroleum, petroleum products and related materials (+9.4%). Major global oil producers cut supply, pushing up prices in the quarter.\"",
