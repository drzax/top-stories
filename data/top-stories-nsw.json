In July it was revealed that Transport Minister Catherine King had rejected Qatar's application for 21 additional flights into Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane per week, on top of its existing 28 weekly flights into Australia's major airports. Yesterday, the Australian Financial Review published comments from Assistant Treasurer Stephen Jones, who explained the government's decision to block the extra Qatar flights was in the national interest and would help keep Qantas profitable. During a Senate committee hearing in Melbourne yesterday, Qantas boss Alan Joyce denied twisting the government's arm on rejecting Qatar's proposal, but Mr Turner told The World Today the reasoning doesn't stack up, because there is a need for flight capacity to increase. \"There's no logic to it, and it is a bit of a worry because we have more demand than capacity ,\" he told the ABC's senior business correspondent Peter Ryan. \"So any extra capacity that certainly for our industry is very important. \"It was clearly not in the national interest as far as I can see. \"You could argue that it could have been in Qantas's interests, it certainly wasn't in Virgin's interest because they have a codeshare relationship with Qatar, so I just don't think it was an argument that held any water .\"",
