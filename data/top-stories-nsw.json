They were targeting them because they are Jews. \"Israel is acting in self-defence, as Australia and many other countries around the world have recognised their right to do so. \"Israel is seeking to disable Hamas and its ability to operate as a terrorist threat.

The comments by Hezbollah's deputy leader, Sheikh Naim Kassem, came as Israel shelled and made drone strikes in southern Lebanon and Hezbollah fired rockets and missiles toward Israel, according to the Associated Press. Hezbollah says six of its fighters were killed on Saturday, while Israel says one of its soldiers was hit by an anti-tank missile in cross-border fighting. It isn't yet possible to independently verify the claims of either side. For Hezbollah, heating up the Lebanon-Israel border has a clear purpose, Kassem says: \"We are trying to weaken the Israeli enemy and let them know that we are ready.\" There are concerns that Iran-backed Hezbollah, which is believed to have a large weapons arsenal, might try to open a new front in the Israel-Hamas war with a large-scale attack on northern Israel.
