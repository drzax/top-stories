Israel says it has struck a compound beneath a mosque in the West Bank that it claims was used by militants to organise attacks, and Palestinian medics say at least one person has been killed. The Palestinian Red Crescent ambulance service said at least one Palestinian was killed and three others injured. It had earlier said that two people were killed. Israel said the compound beneath al-Ansar Mosque, in Jenin, belonged to operatives from Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad who were responsible for attacks in recent months. \"Intel was recently received which indicated that the terrorists, [who] were neutralized, were organizing an imminent terror attack,\" the military said in a statement. Jenin refugee camp, a Palestinian militant stronghold, was the focus of a major Israeli military operation earlier this year.",

Egypt's president again rejected any talk of driving Gaza's 2.3 million Palestinians into the Sinai Peninsula and warned against the \"liquidation of the Palestinian cause\". Jordan's King Abdullah II called Israel's siege and bombardment of Gaza \"a war crime\". The speeches reflected growing anger in the region, even among those with close ties to Israel who have often worked as mediators, as the war sparked by a massive Hamas attack enters a third week with casualties mounting and no end in sight. Egypt is especially concerned about a massive influx of Palestinians crossing into its territory, something that it fears would, among other things, severely undermine hopes for a Palestinian state.
