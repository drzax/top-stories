He fronted the event with two of his grandchildren and said the nation needed this change. \"I know why I'm voting yes because I see people in this community here, we were a community that were downtrodden and were actually imploding as a community for a long time from the scars of dispossession,\" he passionately told the crowd. \"But we empowered ourselves, we found the solution, it was within us, we rebuilt ourselves, we went through healing. \"That is all this Voice is about for us, we want that to happen so we can heal as a country, so we can empower ourselves, so, my granddaughter and our kids don't have to have this industry of closing the gap as something they inherit.\"",
