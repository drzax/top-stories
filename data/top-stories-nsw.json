The British-Palestinian doctor knew the attack would likely lead to a ground incursion of the coastal enclave. Fearing a crisis would befall Gaza's hospitals, he wanted to be there to treat patients with critical conditions. \"I studied in London but did my internship during the conflict in Lebanon in 1996,\" he told the ABC. \"I have a long experience of working in conflict zones — Iraq, Syria, Lebanon and Gaza.\" He says the health system in the region is falling apart, with patients sleeping in corridors.

But White House officials, from the president down, have been talking more and more about their desire to see \"pauses\" in the war. It's likely to be raised as a priority by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken when he meets Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. He's on his way to Israel now. White House national security spokesman John Kirby briefed reporters here in Washington earlier: \"We're really not just talking about, like, one pause. \"What we're trying to do is explore the idea of as many pauses as might be necessary to continue to get aid out, and to continue to work to get people out safely, including hostages. \"The president already worked on one such pause when we were able to get those two Americans out. And that's what we're kind of looking at.\" On Wednesday (local time), Joe Biden voiced support for a humanitarian pause after a protester interrupted a speech he was giving in Minnesota. “As a rabbi, I need you to call for a ceasefire right now,\" yelled the protester, who later identified herself to reporters as Rabbi Jessica Rosenberg from the anti-Zionist Jewish Voice for Peace group. \"I think we need a pause,\" Biden replied, according to a pool reporter at the event. \"A pause means give time to get the prisoners out.\" Yesterday, Foreign Minister Penny Wong reiterated Australia's call for humanitarian pauses .",

We're starting with a question from Australian Shareholders Association, asked by CEO Rachel Waterhouse. She asks Mr Goyder the total value of flight credits on the balance sheet, and if the rate of customer complaints have reduced. She's also asked about a compensation figure for the 1,700 workers illegally sacked by Qantas, as per the High Court's decision a few months ago. Mr Goyder replies that the flight credit is now $520 million, and the airline has paid back $1.25 billion worth of credits. Ms Hudson follows up saying Qantas is focused on credits being redeemed or refunded, and they have \"100 dedicated agents\" in its call centres to ensure customers can access those funds. \"We are going to be unrelenting in the way in which we contact customers, and we've started SMSing customers ... and we've noticed that's driven a lot of uptick [in refunds],\" she says. She also notes that credits will never expire, \"and we're not going to stop until that balance is zero\". On the ground handling issue, Mr Goyder says Ms Hudson will be leading that process in terms of compensation. He says it would be inappropriate right now to discuss compensation regarding the High Court decision. \"I guess we assume it's a significant amount?\" Ms Waterhouse queries. Mr Goyder replies that they are still working through the compensation process.",
