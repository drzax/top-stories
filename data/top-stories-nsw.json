A document presented by Greens senator Barbara Pocock showed a map of the senior leadership of a firm from whom KPMG had taken enormous money, contradicting KPMG's claim that they do not engage in the practice of power mapping. KPMG is the largest public sector consultant in the country. The firm's boss Andrew Yates denied such practice today at the inquiry. But Senator Pocock said it's breaching trust by not being transparent about their contracts. \"We are talking about trust here. This is a breach of trust,\" she said. \"You have breached the Senate's trust and you have breached the trust of the Australian public.\"",
