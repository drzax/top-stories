                  "articleBody": "Analysis by North America Correspondent Barbara Miller Julie Miles — an audience member who voted for Trump in 2020 asked the former president how he planned to appeal to women voters concerned about the decision to overturn the federal right to abortion. Concerns among female voters in particular about the stripping away of abortion rights are a tricky issue for Republicans and are thought to have played into the Democrats better than expected results in November's mid-terms. But Donald Trump appears to misunderstand Julie's concerns, describing the Supreme Court's decision as \"a great victory\", which he personally takes credit for. \"I was so honoured to have done it.\" Fact-check: Donald Trump was no longer in office when the decision was made, but it was likely down to the appointments he made to the Supreme Court while in the White House. Trump says he does believe in exceptions for abortion, if the mother's life is in danger or she was raped. He won't, however, be drawn on whether he'd sign a federal ban on abortion, or give a straight answer on at how many weeks of pregnancy such a ban would be appropriate. The camera pans briefly back to Julie as he speaks, who looks a little confused by the answer."

How often do you interrupt a former President who continues to spout baseless claims? Here’s another challenge already.

That would seem on the face of it unlikely, but how important is fact-checking it when Mr Trump is soon back onto claims that the election was not stolen. He also tells the room he’ll pardon many of the rioters jailed in the wake of January 6."

                  "articleBody": "By North America Correspondent Barbara Miller Straight out the blocks Donald Trump repeats his baseless claim that the 2020 election was stolen. In answer to the first question from moderator Kaitlin Collins as to why Americans should put him back in the White House the President almost immeditately turned to his claims of election fraud. \"That was a rigged election and it’s a shame we had to go through it,\" he said. Kaitlin Collins interrupted the President several times, at one point giving him the option to publicly acknowledge he lost the election, all to no avail. \"That was a horrible election,\" he said \"We have to have honest elections.\" That last comment got warm applause from the audience, who CNN says is made up of Republicans and undeclared voters."

According to the Associated Press, Trump's team saw the invitation from CNN as an opportunity to connect with a broader swath of voters than those who usually tune into the conservative outlets he favors. \"President Trump has been battle-tested and is a proven winner. He doesn’t shy away from anything and faces them head on,\" said Trump spokesperson Steven Cheung ."

The current GOP 2024 presidential frontrunner will take questions live from Republican and undecided voters. Interestingly, CNN's Kaitlan Collins (who is only 31!) will be moderating the town hall discussion. Collins, the network's former chief White House correspondent, was known for getting under the former president's skin during his time in office, according to Politico. Trump clashed with Collins several times, both in the briefing room and on Twitter, often after she challenged him for dodging questions or making false claims."

She was awarded $5 million in damages in her civil lawsuit against the former US president. He plans to appeal. The verdict in Manhattan federal court represented a fresh legal setback for Mr Trump as he seeks to regain the presidency in 2024. It also provided vindication for Carroll, 79, who in 2019 publicly accused Trump, 76, of raping her in a Bergdorf Goodman department store dressing room in the mid-1990s. While jurors did not find that Trump raped Carroll, it awarded damages over the incident and over a post last October on Trump's Truth Social platform in which he called Carroll's claim a \"complete con job\", hoax and lie. It comes ahead of CNN giving Mr Trump a town hall. That will begin in about 20 minutes, and we'll be providing you with updates here ."

Khan — Pakistan's most popular political leader according to polls — was arrested in a fraud case on Tuesday, prompting supporters to storm military buildings and ransack the home of a top army general. The government by Wednesday had approved requests from two of Pakistan's four provinces — Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, both Khan strongholds — and the federal capital Islamabad to deploy troops to restore order."

Marin, 37, the world's youngest prime minister when she took office in 2019, is considered by fans around the globe as a millennial role model for progressive new leaders, even as voters at home opted for a new government."

Concerns among female voters in particular about the stripping away of abortion rights are a tricky issue for Republicans and are thought to have played into the Democrats better than expected results in November's mid-terms. But Donald Trump appears to misunderstand Julie's concerns, describing the Supreme Court's decision as \"a great victory\", which he personally takes credit for. \"I was so honoured to have done it.\" Fact-check: Donald Trump was no longer in office when the decision was made, but it was likely down to the appointments he made to the Supreme Court while in the White House. Trump says he does believe in exceptions for abortion, if the mother's life is in danger or she was raped. He won't, however, be drawn on whether he'd sign a federal ban on abortion, or give a straight answer on at how many weeks of pregnancy such a ban would be appropriate. The camera pans briefly back to Julie as he speaks, who looks a little confused by the answer.",

In answer to the first question from moderator Kaitlin Collins as to why Americans should put him back in the White House the President almost immeditately turned to his claims of election fraud. \"That was a rigged election and it’s a shame we had to go through it,\" he said. Kaitlin Collins interrupted the President several times, at one point giving him the option to publicly acknowledge he lost the election, all to no avail. \"That was a horrible election,\" he said \"We have to have honest elections.\" That last comment got warm applause from the audience, who CNN says is made up of Republicans and undeclared voters.",

She was awarded $5 million in damages in her civil lawsuit against the former US president. He plans to appeal. The verdict in Manhattan federal court represented a fresh legal setback for Mr Trump as he seeks to regain the presidency in 2024. It also provided vindication for Carroll, 79, who in 2019 publicly accused Trump, 76, of raping her in a Bergdorf Goodman department store dressing room in the mid-1990s. While jurors did not find that Trump raped Carroll, it awarded damages over the incident and over a post last October on Trump's Truth Social platform in which he called Carroll's claim a \"complete con job\", hoax and lie. It comes ahead of CNN giving Mr Trump a town hall. That will begin in about 20 minutes, and we'll be providing you with updates here .",

In answer to the first question from moderator Kaitlin Collins as to why Americans should put him back in the White House the President almost immeditately turned to his claims of election fraud. \"That was a rigged election and it’s a shame we had to go through it,\" he said. Kaitlin Collins interrupted the President several times, at one point giving him the option to publicly acknowledge he lost the election, all to no avail. \"That was a horrible election,\" he said \"We have to have honest elections.\" That last comment got warm applause from the audience, who CNN says is made up of Republicans and undeclared voters.",

                  "articleBody": "It's the ongoing debate dominating the economic response to the budget. Both Chris Richardson and Steven Hamilton reckon it will increase inflation, with the possibility of tipping the RBA into another rate rise, if the central bank was on the edge. They spoke to The Business yesterday: But not all economists agree. Former RBA economist and now economics lecturer Zac Gross says the effect on inflation will be negligible. Investment bank Barrenjoey's economics team came up with a similar result from their modelling, as covered by the ABC's Kate Ainsworth :"

Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA) were $383 million, down from $427 million in the previous corresponding period. Net profit after tax (NPAT) was $200 million, down from $246 million in the first half of 2022. Grancorp lifted its full year guidance: EBITDA of $500- $560 million, up from $470- $530 million. NPAT of $220- $260 million, up from $180- 220 million. GrainCorp's Managing Director and Chief Executive Robert Spurway said there was ongoing demand for Australian grain and oilseeds, supported by a bumper third crop on the east coast. \"GrainCorp's export program ran at close to full capacity with 4.4mmt of grain and oilseeds exported during the half,\" Mr Spurway said. \"Export supply chain margins remained solid, albeit not at the levels we saw last year.\" The company also acknowledged the death of a worker in a fatal truck accident in April at the Graincorp receival site in Moree, New South Wales."

The S & P 500 gained 18.47 points, or 0.4 per cent, at 4,137, while the Nasdaq Composite added 126.89 points, or 1 per cent, at 12,306. The Nasdaq was helped by a 4.1 per cent climb in Google's parent company Alphabet as the company rolled out more artificial intelligence for its core search product in response to competition from Microsoft Corp. Large-cap tech stocks including Apple Inc and Microsoft also gained 1.04 per cent and 1.73 per cent, respectively. The rate-sensitive S & P 500 technology sector index went up 1.2 per cent and the communication services rose 1.69 per cent. Markets reacted positively because they saw the inflation data as a small positive, with hopes rising of a rate pause. \"The CPI is indicating some sort of relief in inflationary pressure. That would mean the Fed would be toward the end or already at the end of its interest rate cycle, and growth companies are most heavily affected by higher interest rates,\" Kevin W. Philip, a partner at investment advisor Bel Air said. Fed funds futures traders are pricing in a pause in rate increases at the central bank's June meeting, and less than a 5 per cent chance of another 25 basis point hike. However, investors also had concerns about the looming US debt ceiling. Talks on raising the US federal government's $US31.4 trillion debt ceiling entered a new phase on Wednesday as some areas of potential compromise emerged after Tuesday's White House meeting. Regional bank shares extended declines from volatile sessions last week on concerns about the sector's health. PacWest Bancorp fell 0.5 per cent, and Zions Bancorporation fell 2.7 per cent respectively. Oil and gas producer Occidental Petroleum Corp fell 3.6 per cent after its first-quarter earnings fell short of analysts' estimates. Livent Corp rose 5.2 per cent after Australian lithium miner Allkem Ltd agreed to merge with the US-based chemical manufacturing firm to create a $US10.6 billion firm. Airbnb Inc 10.9 per cent as the vacation rental booking company had fewer bookings and lower average daily rates in the second quarter.

The Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 0.4 per cent last month after gaining 0.1 per cent in March. The increase was in line with economists' expectations, according to Reuters. Stubbornly high rents accounted for much of the increase in inflation. However, there were pockets of relief for consumers. Food prices were unchanged for a second straight month. Grocery store prices fell 0.2 per cent after decreasing 0.3 per cent in March, posting back-to-back declines for the first time since July 2019. Fruits and vegetables, meat, fish and eggs were cheaper compared to March. Milk prices dropped 2 per cent. Natural gas prices tumbled 4.9 per cent and the cost of electricity dropped for the second straight month, blunting some of the 3 per cent jump in gasoline prices, which followed a 4.6 per cent plunge in March. The rebound came after Saudi Arabia and other OPEC+ oil producers announced further oil output cuts. Annual inflation increased 4.9 per cent, which was the smallest yearly rise since April 2021. - with Reuters"

Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA) were $383 million, down from $427 million in the previous corresponding period. Net profit after tax (NPAT) was $200 million, down from $246 million in the first half of 2022. Grancorp lifted its full year guidance: EBITDA of $500- $560 million, up from $470- $530 million. NPAT of $220- $260 million, up from $180- 220 million. GrainCorp's Managing Director and Chief Executive Robert Spurway said there was ongoing demand for Australian grain and oilseeds, supported by a bumper third crop on the east coast. \"GrainCorp's export program ran at close to full capacity with 4.4mmt of grain and oilseeds exported during the half,\" Mr Spurway said. \"Export supply chain margins remained solid, albeit not at the levels we saw last year.\" The company also acknowledged the death of a worker in a fatal truck accident in April at the Graincorp receival site in Moree, New South Wales.",

The S & P 500 gained 18.47 points, or 0.4 per cent, at 4,137, while the Nasdaq Composite added 126.89 points, or 1 per cent, at 12,306. The Nasdaq was helped by a 4.1 per cent climb in Google's parent company Alphabet as the company rolled out more artificial intelligence for its core search product in response to competition from Microsoft Corp. Large-cap tech stocks including Apple Inc and Microsoft also gained 1.04 per cent and 1.73 per cent, respectively. The rate-sensitive S & P 500 technology sector index went up 1.2 per cent and the communication services rose 1.69 per cent. Markets reacted positively because they saw the inflation data as a small positive, with hopes rising of a rate pause. \"The CPI is indicating some sort of relief in inflationary pressure. That would mean the Fed would be toward the end or already at the end of its interest rate cycle, and growth companies are most heavily affected by higher interest rates,\" Kevin W. Philip, a partner at investment advisor Bel Air said. Fed funds futures traders are pricing in a pause in rate increases at the central bank's June meeting, and less than a 5 per cent chance of another 25 basis point hike. However, investors also had concerns about the looming US debt ceiling. Talks on raising the US federal government's $US31.4 trillion debt ceiling entered a new phase on Wednesday as some areas of potential compromise emerged after Tuesday's White House meeting. Regional bank shares extended declines from volatile sessions last week on concerns about the sector's health. PacWest Bancorp fell 0.5 per cent, and Zions Bancorporation fell 2.7 per cent respectively. Oil and gas producer Occidental Petroleum Corp fell 3.6 per cent after its first-quarter earnings fell short of analysts' estimates. Livent Corp rose 5.2 per cent after Australian lithium miner Allkem Ltd agreed to merge with the US-based chemical manufacturing firm to create a $US10.6 billion firm. Airbnb Inc 10.9 per cent as the vacation rental booking company had fewer bookings and lower average daily rates in the second quarter. Rivian Automotive jumped 1.8 per cent after the electrical vehicle maker beat estimates for its first-quarter results and reiterated its annual production forecast. - with Reuters",

The Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 0.4 per cent last month after gaining 0.1 per cent in March. The increase was in line with economists' expectations, according to Reuters. Stubbornly high rents accounted for much of the increase in inflation. However, there were pockets of relief for consumers. Food prices were unchanged for a second straight month. Grocery store prices fell 0.2 per cent after decreasing 0.3 per cent in March, posting back-to-back declines for the first time since July 2019. Fruits and vegetables, meat, fish and eggs were cheaper compared to March. Milk prices dropped 2 per cent. Natural gas prices tumbled 4.9 per cent and the cost of electricity dropped for the second straight month, blunting some of the 3 per cent jump in gasoline prices, which followed a 4.6 per cent plunge in March. The rebound came after Saudi Arabia and other OPEC+ oil producers announced further oil output cuts. Annual inflation increased 4.9 per cent, which was the smallest yearly rise since April 2021. - with Reuters",

Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA) were $383 million, down from $427 million in the previous corresponding period. Net profit after tax (NPAT) was $200 million, down from $246 million in the first half of 2022. Grancorp lifted its full year guidance: EBITDA of $500- $560 million, up from $470- $530 million. NPAT of $220- $260 million, up from $180- 220 million. GrainCorp's Managing Director and Chief Executive Robert Spurway said there was ongoing demand for Australian grain and oilseeds, supported by a bumper third crop on the east coast. \"GrainCorp's export program ran at close to full capacity with 4.4mmt of grain and oilseeds exported during the half,\" Mr Spurway said. \"Export supply chain margins remained solid, albeit not at the levels we saw last year.\" The company also acknowledged the death of a worker in a fatal truck accident in April at the Graincorp receival site in Moree, New South Wales.",
