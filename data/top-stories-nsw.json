It has been heading south and is now ever so close to $US100 a tonne. Take a look at this chart compiled by economists at CBA that shows the price movement since August 2020. The spot price for the commodity peaked in about May 2021 about $US240 a tonne. The price plunge links back to demand from China. Spot prices are down about 11 per cent since July 25. CBA's Mining and Energy Commodities expert, Vivek Dhar writes: \"Markets are concerned that policymakers may not follow through with any meaningful support for China's commodity-intensive economy following the semi-annual economic conference attended by China's top leaders ('Politburo'). The conference, which took place in late July, saw China's top leaders pledge to \"strength counter cyclical policies\", where an \"adjustment\" would be made to the restrictions on the property sector. Policymakers even reportedly talked of bringing forward infrastructure spending to help support the economy. These announcements though lacked details such as targets and timelines .\" China's property sector accounts for 35-40% of China's steel consumption. Most of China's property sector indicators have worsened through the first half of 2023. \"It's challenging to see how policymakers turn-around China's property sector, particularly given the extent of supply and demand side issues that are weighing on the sector at present. A number of factors began last year when China's COVID-zero policy crippled household balance sheets and saw a number of property developers default. We think steel demand from China's property sector will likely only stabilise next year. The rapid fall in iron ore prices over the last week raises downside risks to our forecast for iron ore prices to fall to $US100/t by Q4 2023. \" Iron ore miners like BHP, Rio Tinto and FMG will often sayu they're playing the long game and don't watch spot prices, but I'm pretty sure they'll be keeping a close eye on this activity in China. It's also worth pointing out, $US100 it still much higher than the government's long term price estimates of $US55 a tonne .",

Senator Karen Grogan began her line of questioning by asking Treasury officials whether they were concerned with housing supply and what their forecasts were for the sector, or whether it was simply house prices they were focused on. Treasury's Luke Yeaman said they keep a close eye on both the construction sector and rental market â especially the latter given it has a direct impact on inflation. He said there had been \"some divergence\" between medium density apartments versus standalone homes, and there had been a large surge in approvals for standalone homes because of the HomeBuilder scheme during COVID. Supply chain issues however are still having an impact on the construction sector, which is in turn affecting the housing market, because while there is a large pipeline of new housing coming online, it's much slower than expected because of those construction issues, he said. Senator Grogan asked whether Treasury expects its forecasted housing supply to be on track, to which Mr Yeaman responded that they are expecting medium density housing to alleviate pressure in the market in the next 12 to 18 months, especially with strong growth in migration. Treasury's Assistant Secretary for Housing, Kerren Crosthwaite, followed up Mr Yeaman by saying they expect some easing in the rental market when more social and affordable housing is built. Ms Crosthwaite said currently there are more people in the private rental market because there has been a reduction in available public housing. She said between 2011 and 2022, there was a reduction in social housing from 4.8% to 4.1%, which came back to state and local governments across the jurisdictions and their respective decisions.",

Treasury's forecast for GDP (or economic growth) in the May budget was 3.25% for the 2022-23 financial year, and Senator Hume asked if that was going to be achieved. Ineke Redmond from Treasury said they still needed to compile and review data to form a more thorough assessment, but said developments including population growth (including migration) could see an increase in GDP, if not equalling that forecast, despite a slightly sharp fall in consumption because of inflation and interest rates. Treasury's Luke Yeaman also reiterated Ms Redmond's comments and said overall the economy was tracking \"quite close\" to its growth forecasts. Mr Yeaman said while he wouldn't attribute a number to economic growth right now, the economy was developing broadly in line with its expectations as forecast in the budget. (For what it's worth, the RBA's just released economic outlook within its August Statement on Monetary Policy shows the central bank is now expecting a year-average GDP growth to be 3% for the 2022-23 financial year .)",
