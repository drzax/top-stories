Talkback callers asked how a potential federal Voice would interact with SA's own Voice to Parliament. Mr Malinauskas, in the Yes camp, said the two are \"completely separate propositions\". \"If there's a Yes outcome on the weekend, the state-based Voice and the federally-based Voice will be unique,\" he said. \"That is in many respects no different to countless other organisations that the parliament and government have set up to provide on any number of decisions.\" Mr Speirs, a No campaigner, was also asked by callers if he were to win the next election, would the Liberals change the state Voice. \"I've been very clear publicly that we would watch the state-based Voice as it unfolded and would be open to amending it or changing the way it worked, if it wasn't working effectively,\" he said. \"We'll have to see the outcome in South Australia on Saturday evening or Sunday when those results become apparent as to whether a No vote in South Australia can be read as a lack of support for the premier's legislated state-based voice.\"",

The flight will leave early next week with further details to be released by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade within the next 24 hours. Senator Wong says the department is coordinating the flight, and anyone seeking to leave should register their interest through Smart Traveller. She said the government was considering whether further flights were needed. \"I did last night agree to a third flight,\" she said. \"My anticipation is that demand will require at least a further flight. We will look at whether any further assisted departures are required.\"",

What are your thoughts on Geelong wanting Ollie Lord to leave Alberton as part of a trade for Esava Ratugolea with Port Adelaide rather than taking pick 24? - Adam. This is all based on reports out of Adelaide overnight that not only are Geelong saying no to pick 24 for Esava Ratugolea, they also want Ollie Lord out of Port Adelaide too. At the moment, I would call this wildly optimistic. But Geelong are no strangers to some aggressive negotiating at the trade table, and more often than not it works out well for them. I imagine Port will end up chucking a little something else to pick 24 to get the deal done. But I'd be pretty stunned if that something else was Ollie Lord.",

You might remember Ablemarle has bene courting Liontown for months now and revised their offer to $3 share about a month ago. But since then Australia's richest person Gina Rinehart has been not-so-quietly buying up stock to increase her share in the company. Liontown had granted the world's biggest lithium chemical maker, Ablemarle, a four-week period to examine its books to enable it to put forward a binding offer. Albemarle's due diligence is substantially complete and it requires a short extension, Liontown said. Ms Rinehart's firm, Hancock Prospecting, has again increased its stake in Liontown to 19.9 per cent. It's enough to potentially hamper the US mining giant's takeover attempt. Albemarle needs 75 per cent support from Liontown investors in a shareholder vote to succeed with its bid. A stake of between 15 per cent and 20 per cent can often become a blocking stake depending on investor turnout on the day of the shareholder vote. Liontown had backed Albemarle's offer to shareholders.",
