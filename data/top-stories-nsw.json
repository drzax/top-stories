That comes after record half-year production of 91.3 million barrels of oil equivalent, and despite a fall in oil prices. Investors get an interim dividend of $US0.80 a share, down 27 per cent from the same time last year. Woodside says development of its major growth project, Scarborough, off the north-west coast of WA, is nearly 40 per cent complete. Chief executive Meg O'Neill says Woodside is continuing to investigate the death of a worker at its North Rankin platform in June, the first fatality at an offshore platform in Australia in more than ten years. “We have implemented changes to our operational practices based on the preliminary findings of those  investigations and shared our learnings with the broader industry,\" Ms O'Neill said. “Woodside’s safety performance over the past two years has been below the standard we set for ourselves.  We know we must do better and are resolved to strive for a return to leading safety performance.\"",
