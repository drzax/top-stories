Fresh off having an entire State Football Centre in WA named in her honour, Sam Kerr was announced as the runner-up for the prestigious Ballon d'Or award on Tuesday, widely regarded as one of the biggest and most important individual accolades in world football. She'd been short-listed a bunch of times before, but second is her best-ever finish, falling just behind Spain's Aitana Bonmati ( who was expected to win after she also won Player of the Tournament at the Women's World Cup). Kerr wasn't at the ceremony, though. Bizarrely, it was scheduled right in the middle of the current international window (but not the men's window, funnily enough!), which meant the majority of the nominees for the women's award weren't actually there. The whole ceremony was a bit of a disaster, really. The person who presented the women's award was famous male non-football player Novak Djokovic, who has expressed opinions in the past about why women athletes don't deserve equal pay (though has since apparently changed his mind). And when Bonmati went on stage to collect her award, the actual trophy wasn't even there. Someone from backstage had apparently forgotten about it, so had to hurriedly unbox it and hand it to her when she was already at the podium to give her speech. She then went on to talk about equality, opportunity for women, and fighting for what's right off the pitch. Lol. Earlier today, Kerr was also named the AFC Women's Player of the Year in a ceremony that she also couldn't attend. Come on, guys: it's not that hard to sync up all your e-calendars, surely!?",

In fact, Chinese Taipei were one of Asia's most successful women's national teams from the late 1970s and 1990s. They won three Asian Cup titles between 1977 and 1981 and finished no lower than fourth in the tournament all the way up to 1999. They were one of just three Asian teams to qualify for the first-ever Women's World Cup back in 1991, alongside Japan and China, and made it all the way to the quarterfinals where they lost to the USA. Not only that, but Taiwan (the country) actually helped to organise the first Women's World Invitational Tournament — known as the Chunghua Cup — all the way back in 1978! So we basically have Taiwan to thank for helping kick-start the development of the Women's World Cup and making into what we know it as today. Unfortunately, as the rest of Asia (and then the world) began to invest in women's football, Taiwan fell further and further behind. You can read more about the history of the \"Mulan\" (yes, that Mulan, as the team used to be called), plus the geopolitical tensions between Taiwan and China in the context of football, in a story I wrote earlier this year. (Best Disney movie ever, just quietly). Chinese Taipei come into tonight's game still trying to claw their way back up the Asian football ladder. They're technically ranked higher than the Philippines, and come off some good wins in September's Asian Games, but they're yet to win a game in this Olympic qualifying stage and are out of contention to progress, so they've only really got pride and experience to play for tonight.",

The last time the Matildas dominated the first half of a competitive match in the way we saw them do a few days ago was in that record-breaking 18-0 defeat of Indonesia at the 2022 Women's Asian Cup, where they'd scored 9 goals by half-time. Sam Kerr scored five that day, rocketing past Tim Cahill to become Australia's all-time leading goal-scorer, and her hat-trick against the Philippines was a reminder of just how lucky we are to have a footballer of her calibre leading our national team. The 59,155 people who showed up to Perth Stadium absolutely got their money's worth, not only seeing their hometown hero find the back of the net three times, but also seeing the Matildas play some truly quicksilver football. Returning to the same line-up that played together for most of the Women's World Cup, you could immediately see the difference from that scrappy opening game against Iran. The structure was clearer, the combination play was more intuitive, the tempo was higher, the touches were cleaner, the finishing was deadlier. They played both possession-based and counter-attacking football, they defended confidently, and they just looked like they were having a whole heap of fun. Caitlin Foord - with three goals and four assists - was deservedly named player of the match, with some internet legend already turning her epic third goal into the gif below: It was really only when the substitutions were made that things started to get a little less convincing. It was similar vibes to the Iran game: basically a bunch of midfielders struggling to click with each other without a striker to aim for. Clare Wheeler was a bright spark, though, scoring her debut goal for Australia, while Amy Sayer had some good moments as well. Alex Chidiac got fouled a bunch of times, and Cortnee Vine unfortunately pinged a hamstring and had to come off 10 minutes after going on. But those are the only small smudges on what was otherwise a machine-clean performance. What did you make of their outing against the Philippines, fam? Did you have a favourite moment, a favourite pass, a favourite goal (there were plenty to choose from)? Log into the comments and tell me your thoughts!",
