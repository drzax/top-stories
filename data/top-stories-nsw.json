It says the 2022/23 STIP and the 2021/23 long-term incentive plan (LTIP) remain subject to Board discretion and clawback should the Board determine that this is necessary. The full extent of the CEO's remuneration subject to clawback and/or malus is up to $14.4 million as set out in the body of the financial report. Statutory remuneration was $11.9 million. What about the recent converting of Rights to shares by Mr Joyce? The report says after offering in previous years to defer the decision on vesting of Rights awarded under the 2018-2020 LTIP, 2019-2021 LTIP and the 2020-2022 LTIP, Joyce elected in August 2023 to convert these Rights to shares. \" The combined value of these three LTIPs contributed $6.45 million to the CEO's actual outcome of $21.4 million for 2022/23 ,\" the report says",
