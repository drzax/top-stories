Dargan performed on X-Factor in 2014, telling SBS that she sung in front of John Legend in New York. Her opponent is Amber Amelia (3-1), a Palawa woman who hails from Lake Macquarie. This is the first time an Australian title will be contested between two Indigenous women, for a belt that now features the Indigenous flag on it. Both women came in under the weight limit yesterday (54.94kg and 54.74kg respectively) and, again, were fully respectful of each other during the face off which, frankly, was lovely to see.",
