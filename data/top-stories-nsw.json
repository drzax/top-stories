NAB will raise its standard variable mortgage rate by 0.25 of a percentage point from November 17. That rate underpins all its discounted variable lending rates, which will rise accordingly. The bank said it will also lift its Reward Saver bonus interest rate by 0.25 of a percentage point, while continually reviewing its other savings and term deposit rates. NAB's group executive for personal banking, Rachel Slade, urged any customers in financial difficulty to contact the bank sooner rather than later. \"While most of our customers are in good shape, there may be some people who are more concerned about the first rate rise since mid-year which is why it's crucial to reach out to your bank as soon as you can. We're here to help,\" she said in a statement. \"Customers continue to build and flex their 'budgeting muscle' and they're responding to cost of living pressures by reducing their spending on dining out, fuel and leisure travel.\"",

The successful management of the necessary CEO succession process must now be the Board's priority.\" Premier Investments also recently announced that it has started a formal review to assess its corporate, operating, and capital structure, with a particular focus on Peter Alexander, Smiggle, and the apparel brands.",

The subject was brought up during a working dinner late on Tuesday, host Japan said in a statement, with the group due to continue talks on Wednesday. The statement gave no details of options being discussed if the Hamas militant group is ousted from Gaza. Diplomats in Washington, the United Nations, the Middle East and beyond have also started weighing the options. Discussions include the deployment of a multinational force to post-conflict Gaza, an interim Palestinian-led administration that would exclude Hamas politicians, a stopgap security and governance role for neighbouring Arab states and temporary UN supervision of the territory, Reuters reported. G7 foreign ministers are due to issue a statement mentioning the Israel-Gaza crisis later today, marking only the second such joint statement from the group on the issue since October 7. The statement will present the G7's \"united stance\" on the Middle East situation, Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirokazu Matsuno said. It is expected to include a call for humanitarian pauses, temporary breaks in fighting to allow aid into the besieged enclave, Japanese media reported on Wednesday. The G7 is made up of Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States, with the European Union also participating in the talks.",

The IDF has published vision and a folder of photos appearing to show troops and bulldozers near Al Noor amusement park south of Gaza City. On Telegram, it said it located an underground tunnel running adjacent to the theme park and destroyed it. The folder of images also included a photo appearing to show soldiers and tanks in the vicinity of a different ferris wheel about 9 kilometres away. Map data analysed by the ABC indicates this ferris wheel is located near the Al Hilal (The Crescent) Sports Club, near the coast north of Gaza City. The IDF did not comment on what its soldiers were doing in this area in its Telegram post. In its update, it also said it had destroyed an \"underground tunnel shaft and a weapons warehouse\" containing chemicals and mines, found near a university, but the ABC could not identify the location from the provided vision. Earlier today the IDF said it was moving into the \"heart of Gaza city\". Both ferris wheels are located about 5km away from the city centre. The ABC could not independently verify when the IDF's photos were taken.",

A family of three Australian citizens crossed the border to Egypt through Rafah on November 7, the ABC has confirmed. Departures out of Gaza depend on \"a range of factors\", the spokesperson said, with a challenging situation on the ground changing rapidly. \"The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is assisting 76 individuals in Gaza, including Australians and their families, who have requested our help to depart\", the DFAT said. \"Australia is doing what we can to support those Australians and their families still in Gaza, including providing the best available information and options for their safety, and communicating through all available channels.\" The spokesperson said Australia was supporting international efforts to keep the Rafah border crossing open for humanitarian purposes and for civilians to pass through. Australians in need of emergency consular assistance should contact the Australian Government's 24-hour Consular Emergency Centre on +61 2 6261 3305 (from overseas) or 1300 555 135 (from within Australia).",
