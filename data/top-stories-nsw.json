That's been a tremendous batting display in tricky conditions to be just one down at stumps. Warner was the only batter to fall for Australia, and he won't be happy about it, a poor shot to a nothing ball outside off catching his outside edge. Aside from that it's been pretty straight forward as England's bowlers failed to get the ball singing in cloudy conditions. England's first innings score of 283 came in double quick time, but having lost wickets in clumps, there could be an argument to say they wasted their chances to capitalise on starts and make a bigger score past 300. However, as has been the case throughout this series, it's very much all still to play for. And we'll be back to tell you all about it right here tomorrow.
