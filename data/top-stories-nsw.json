The RBA had offered the pay increase over three years to junior and mid-level staff. Under the proposal, staff would get a 4 per cent pay rise at the start of the new agreement, 3.5 per cent from September 2024, and 3 per cent from September 2025. But after the ballot closed this week, 57 per cent of staff voted to reject the offer. Jason Hall, the national assistant secretary for the Finance Sector Union, said RBA staff had sent a clear message to management by rejecting their pay offer. \"We hope the RBA now understands that it must deal with the expectations of its workforce and substantially increase this pay offer ,\" he said.

Stocks in Nvidia barely ended higher on Thursday, after hitting a new record early in the session when it beat expectations by positing a quarterly revenue of $US13.51 billion after the bell. The chip maker also predicted revenue would hit an eye-watering $US16 billion in the third quarter. During trade, Nvidia rose to $US502.66, and lifted its stock to 223% higher in the year to date. But while all eyes were on Nvidia's results, other chip makers fell as a result. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index lost more than 3%, Marvell Technology and Nvidia rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc each tumbled nearly 7%, while Intel dropped 4.1%. Despite being buoyed by Nvidia, the Nasdaq finished lower, with some investors taking profit after the rally and markets being generally nervous about Jerome Powell's impending speech .",
