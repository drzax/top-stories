Unusually, the bank was somewhat at pains to talk down its profitability, pointing out that a return on equity of 14% was well below peaks closer to 20% around a decade ago. And Barrenjoey's very experienced banking analyst Jon Mott believes that could fall even further to 12% as the bank faces cost pressures from inflation, a declining net interest margin and growing loan losses as bad debts rise. He has an $85 price target on CBA shares, about 18% below its current share price of $103.77. \"CBA remains in a solid position with a strong management team, dominant share in retail banking and a growing business banking presence. However, the macro and competitive environments are challenging,\" he wrote. \"We believe that the risk/return outlook is skewed to the downside.\" One of the big risks is how many of CBA's mortgage customers will be able to keep paying their home loans if interest rates go higher, or even remain at current levels. CBA's CEO Matt Comyn told Kirsten Aiken on The Business that the bank has already called about 100,000 customers it considered financially at risk to ask them if they needed any assistance. Hundreds of thousands of CBA customers are rolling off cheap fixed rate loans over the next year or so, going from rates around 2% to variable rates above 6%. And, even for those who aren't in \"mortgage prison\" and can refinance, it turns out that it's harder to get a cheap deal. As Stephanie Chalmers explains, below, banks (especially the big four) are dialing back aggressive cash back offers and rate discounts for new customers as they seek to maintain their net interest margins and profitability.",

Disney CEO Bob Iger was discussing the entertainment giant's quarterly results overnight, and announced that it would be hiking the price of its ad-free tier of the Disney+ streaming service by 27% — taking it to $US13.99 a month for those in the US. The price increase will take effect in the US from October 12, and the company is planning to roll out the higher subscription payments to its European customers from December. Meanwhile Disney is also going to introduce lower-cost, ad-supported streaming plans to Canada, the UK and other European markets from November 1 at a lower price point. Cracking down on password sharin g is also firmly in Disney's sights, with Iger saying it plans to roll out a strategy similar to what Netflix recently unveiled \"sometime in 2024\". Right now, Disney hasn't said whether the price increase will affect those of us here in Australia — but given the increases we've seen with other streaming services like Netflix and Spotify, it seems to be a matter of when it affects us, not if .",

In a segment of the Kyle and Jackie O program broadcast in August 2022, the controversial Sydney media personality \"stereotyped gay men as irresponsible in regard to their sexual health\", the Australian Communications and Media Authority ruled. It says Sandilands painted them as prime carriers of a virus that presented a danger to the community and did not deserve any sympathy or compassion. The 2022 outbreak of the virus formerly known as monkeypox, which caused more than 140 confirmed cases, was declared a communicable disease incident of national significance by the chief medical officer. ACMA chair Nerida O'Loughlin says Sandilands's comments were derisive and insulting and breached standards of decency expected by the public. \"Although there was a basis at the time for a public discussion about mpox that involved reference to gay sexuality, the segment went beyond any acceptable standards by conveying that gay men were irresponsible, were a risk to the community and did not deserve any sympathy even when presenting for medical assistance,\" she says. In a submission to the investigation, broadcaster KIIS 106.5 argued the segment was intended to bring about awareness to the community of the public health risk of mpox, but conceded it contained \"some unfavourable descriptions of those susceptible to the virus, being homosexual males\".
