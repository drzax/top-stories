The pauses, which would allow people to flee along two humanitarian corridors and could be used for the release of hostages, were significant first steps, White House national security spokesperson John Kirby said. But as night approached, there were no immediate reports of a lull in fighting raging among the ruined buildings in the north of the Gaza Strip. There was also no direct confirmation from Israel, which spoke more generally of measures that appeared to correspond to arrangements already in place. \"We are undertaking localised and pinpoint measures to enable the exit of Palestinian civilians from Gaza City southward, so that we do not harm them. These things do not detract from the war fighting,\" Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said. However, he reiterated there would be no full ceasefire for now. \"We will not stop fighting as long as our hostages are in Gaza and as long as we have not completed our mission, which is toppling the Hamas regime and eliminating its military and governance capabilities,\" he said. Israeli forces completely encircled Gaza City in recent days and the military has been allowing civilians safe passage along the main route south for three or four hours each day, with ever-growing numbers of families opting to escape.

Ms Rogers said she wanted \"to stress the importance of adjusting proactively to a future where interest rates may be higher than they've been over the past 15 years \". If you're not familiar with the Bank of Canada's cash rate history, their rate was just 0.25% throughout most of the pandemic, and never went past 1.75%. Now, it's at a 22-year high of 5.0%, after increasing rates 10 times between March 2022 and July this year, with inflation peaking at more than 8% last year. The BoC left rates on hold last month, and has the same attitude as other central banks around the world when it comes to future rate hikes (that they could still raise rates again, if needed). Inflation in Canada isn't expected to reach its 2% target until the end of 2025, according to the BoC's forecasts. Ms Rogers also said some households in Canada were already struggling to deal with existing debt, with delinquency rates back at (or surpassing) pre-pandemic levels for credit cards, car loans and other unsecured lines of credit. Delinquency rates on mortgages however are still lower than before the pandemic, she said, but 60% of fixed-rate mortgage holders who will have to renew their mortgages by the end of 2026 \"may face significantly higher payments\". All that said, even though some of the BoC's own policy setters see the need to lift rates again, economists expect the BoC to start easing rates as early as April, and money markets see them coming down mid-2024.",

Let's start overseas, where Wall Street has been incredibly tepid after comments from the US Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell on inflation. During a speech at the International Monetary Fund (IMF if you're up with the lingo), he said central bank officials \"are not confident\" that interest rates are high enough to tame inflation. Even if there's improvements to goods, services and labour, Mr Powell said the Fed wouldn't hesitate to lift rates again — and those hawkish comments have naturally sent the jitters through Wall Street. \" We are not confident that we have achieved such a stance [to bring inflation back to target],\" he said. \"We will continue to move carefully, however, allowing us to address both the risk of being misled by a few good months of data, and the risk of overtightening.\" His comments come just days after Federal Reserve governor Michelle Bowman said there is a high level of uncertainty in the economy. Coupled with a poorly received auction of US 30-year Treasury debt, Wall Street was heading lower at the close of trade. So where does that leave us back home? Somewhat unsurprisingly, the Australian share market is set for a modest open, with futures down slightly. But the big event coming up will be the RBA's Statement of Monetary Policy — aka the central bank's full forecasts for inflation and the economy. It'll also shed some light on governor Michele Bullock's post-meeting statement on Tuesday afternoon, specifically the comment that inflation will be \"at the top of the target range of 2 to 3% by the end of 2025\". The RBA's last SoMP had inflation coming in at 2.8% by the end of 2025 — so all eyes will be on seeing whether this has changed. Still with me? That's the spirit. Grab a coffee and let's get through the final day of the (traditional) working week together.",
