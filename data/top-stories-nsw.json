In a statement to the ASX, BHP says a review suggests rostered employees in Australia had their leave incorrectly deducted on public holidays since 2010. \"There are approximately 28,500 affected current and former employees with an average of six leave days in total that have been incorrectly deducted from affected employees,\" they told the ASX. BHP also said it's found around 400 current and former employees in Port Hedland are entitled to additional allowances \"due to an error with the employment entity in their contract\". BHP estimates the cost of fixing the issue will be around $US280 million pre-tax — which works out to be roughly $430 million. Geraldine Slattery, BHP's Australian President has apologised to the employees affected by the errors. \"This is not good enough and falls short of the standards we expect at BHP,\" she said. \"We are working to rectify and remediate these issues, with interest, as quickly as possible.\" BHP says it has self-reported to the Fair Work Ombudsman, and will contact current and former employees who have been affected.",
