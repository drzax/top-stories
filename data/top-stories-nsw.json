Prime Minister Bisher al Khasawneh said \"all options are on the table for Jordan in our dealing with the Israeli aggression on Gaza and its repercussions,\" but did not elaborate on what steps the kingdom would take. Last week Jordan recalled its ambassador and announced that Israel's ambassador, who left Amman shortly after Hamas' attack, would not be allowed to come back, effectively declaring him persona non grata. Mr Khasawneh said Israel's siege of the densely populated Gaza was not self-defence as it maintains. \"The brutal Israeli attack does not discriminate between civilian and military targets and is extending to safe areas and ambulances,\" he said. In a statement, Israel's foreign ministry said the country's \"relations with Jordan are of strategic importance to both countries and we regret the inflammatory statements from Jordan's leadership\". Yesterday, Jordan's King Abdullah II said his air force dropped \"urgent medical aid\" to a field hospital operated by the kingdom in Gaza. The airdrop bypasses a growing bottleneck of aid deliveries to Gaza via Rafah, the enclave's border crossing with Egypt. The Jordanian army have operated the 40-bed hospital, on the outskirts of Gaza City, since 2009. Israel says it \"coordinated\" with Jordan on the drop and that the aid \"will be used by the medical staff for patients,\" and also includes food. The Israel-Gaza war is tricky for Jordan to navigate. The nation is a unique player in the region, walking a diplomatic tightrope as it seeks to maintain ties with neighbours and powerful allies. The conflict also appears to be putting pressure on the kingdom's rulers, King Abdullah and Queen Rania. My colleague Lucia Stein and I wrote a story about it, which you can read below if you'd like to learn more.",

              "plaintext": "Oil prices edged higher on Monday after top exporters Saudi Arabia and Russia reaffirmed their commitment to extra voluntary oil supply cuts until the end of the year. Brent crude futures rose 0.3% to $US85.18 a barrel, while US West Texas Intermediate crude gained 0.4% to $US80.82. Saudi Arabia confirmed on Sunday it would continue its additional voluntary cut of 1 million barrels per day (bpd) in December to keep output around 9 million bpd, a ministry of energy source said. Russia also announced it would continue its additional voluntary cut of 300,000 bpd from its crude oil and petroleum product exports until the end of December. The cuts could be extended into the first quarter of 2024 because of \"seasonally weaker oil demand at the start of every year, ongoing economic growth concerns and the aim of producers and OPEC+ to support the oil market's stability and balance\", said UBS strategist Giovanni Staunovo. Oil prices rebounded after both benchmarks fell by around 6% in the week to November 3, as supply concerns driven by Middle East tensions eased. UN agency leaders demanded a humanitarian ceasefire on Monday, a month into the war in Gaza, as health authorities in the enclave said the death toll from Israeli strikes now exceeded 10,000.",
