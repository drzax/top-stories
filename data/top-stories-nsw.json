He's a wrecker, and it's much easier to punch down than to help lift up. \"And that is what the leader of the opposition sought to do, to wreck and to ruin, not to build and to inspire.\" Mackellar's independent MP Sophie Scamps said she was \"very proud\" of the way the debate was run in her electorate, blaming misinformation for the result. \"I do think there was a broad misinformation, disinformation campaign and Australians really had a lot of questions,\" Dr Scamps said. \"I think on the exit polls coming out, people on both sides of the campaign would like to know that they can trust the information that politicians are telling them. It is fundamental to our democracy.\" Earlier today, Mr Dutton said the country had spoken in \"overwhelming fashion\" by rejecting the proposal of the Voice to Parliament.",

I'd really like to see the prime minister lean in on that.\" The Arrernte/Luritja woman from Central Australia, told ABC News that the next steps forward need to ensure Aboriginal people have agency in conversations and solutions made about them in an attempt to close the gap. \"The path we went down ahead of referendum clearly isn't going to be the one we walk together but we do need to sort this out. We do need to keep moving because the issues that brought us to the referendum exist with us today, Those stats relating to closing the gap still exist and they need a different solution, and [that needs] to be a solution that's defined by Aboriginal people who know what is happening with the underlying drivers, who know how to solve that,\" she said. She said it was important these \"challenging\" conversations were had in a way that did not damage vulnerable children. \"I think that's about having kind conversations, that's about looking for hope, that's about looking for what comes next and charting that pathway,\" she said about protecting children post-referendum. \"Being honest and being really aware what you say in public and how you say it is heard by our children. \"And even when you look back at election night, children were watching, children were watching that result and they were watching how people responded.\"",

Abermarle says it decided to dump the bid because there were \"growing complexities\" around the transaction. The US miner's decision comes days after Hancock Prospecting, the iron ore miner controlled by Gina Rinehart, increased its stake in Liontown to 19.9% —which would have likely been enough to block Abermarle's takeover bid of $3 a share. \"Our engagement with the Liontown team has been meaningful and productive. We appreciate the level of cooperation we have received, and we thank the entire team for their efforts,\" Albemarle CEO Kent Masters said in a statement. \"That said, moving forward with the acquisition, at this time, is not in Albemarle's best interests .\" Hancock Prospecting has not commented on the development. Liontown Resources entered a trading halt earlier this morning, shortly after making the announcement to the market. The company says the halt will remain in place until Liontown makes an announcement regarding the funding of its Kathleen Valley project, or Wednesday October 18 — whichever comes first.
