I don't know about you but sometimes it can feel unfair that the responsibility is shifted to us as individuals when they're responsible for large-scale waste and emissions. Here's what Craig says: The role that business plays is crucial. And government too. Yes, in the show we give tips for what you can do. But in a lot of cases the reason that higher recycling rates are not being met or waste avoided or emissions skyrocketing is out of our hands as individuals. It is in how packaging is designed. It is in how clothing is manufactured and marketed. It is what infrastructure has been built. It is in the energy used in manufacturing. So a lot of this series is focused on what business and government need to do to make the system work better. Australians have actually been pretty good at putting their recycling in their bins for years. It is time for the system to actually catch up to our expectations. Which doesn’t mean individuals don’t have a role, but one of those roles is demanding better from business and government.",

From a waste perspective, reducing our food waste and keeping it out of landfill is a big thing we can do to be more sustainable. When food is uneaten we waste so many resources – the land, water, transport and energy that went into making it. And when we bury it in landfill, it breaks down without oxygen which creates methane, a potent greenhouse gas. So keeping our food waste out of landfill should be a priority for Australia. Reducing our use of single-use plastics is also a big goal. We can do some of this ourselves through changes in our habits (going reusable for water bottles and coffee cups etc) but it is very hard to avoid plastic in our society. So as long as it remains part of our world, we have to increase how much of it we actually recycle. Recycled plastic uses less energy and creates less emissions than virgin plastic. So, we have to get our plastic recycling above the pitiful 13% level that it's currently at. This takes companies designing better packaging and governments not only building recycling infrastructure (there has been a lot of new stuff already) but also putting in place rules to encourage recycling.",

When food is uneaten we waste so many resources – the land, water, transport and energy that went into making it.

We can do some of this ourselves through changes in our habits (going reusable for water bottles and coffee cups etc) but it is very hard to avoid plastic in our society. So as long as it remains part of our world, we have to increase how much of it we actually recycle. Recycled plastic uses less energy and creates less emissions than virgin plastic. So, we have to get our plastic recycling above the pitiful 13% level that it's currently at. This takes companies designing better packaging and governments not only building recycling infrastructure (there has been a lot of new stuff already) but also putting in place rules to encourage recycling."

I don't want to spoil too much but it's definitely worth watching War On Waste tonight for more info. In the mean time, this is Craig 's answer on where things are up to: So many people are asking me “when can we recycle our soft plastics again” after the collapse of the REDcycle recycling scheme. We look into why this collapsed in the show tonight. The main problem was a lack of ways to actually process the soft plastics. Some went into chairs and bollards. Some went into roads. But we didn’t have enough ways to recycle (or downcycle) it, especially when we started dropping off much more soft plastics during COVID. The other issue was the public weren't aware of the problems the scheme was facing so it came as a shock when we found the stockpiles of plastic (we visit some of these in the show and they are quite overwhelming). There are some interesting tests being done on new systems which can hopefully lead to a proper soft plastic recycling system in the future. There are tests going on for kerbside soft plastic pickups which we look at in episode two. There are also test facilities for “chemical recycling” which tries to break the plastics back into an oil that, with refining, can then be turned back into plastic again. But this is early days and we need to make sure that these systems are not done at such a small scale that they are just a green wash to make plastic seem more recyclable than it is.",

We look into why this collapsed in the show tonight. The main problem was a lack of ways to actually process the soft plastics. Some went into chairs and bollards. Some went into roads. But we didn’t have enough ways to recycle (or downcycle) it, especially when we started dropping off much more soft plastics during COVID. The other issue was the public weren't aware of the problems the scheme was facing so it came as a shock when we found the stockpiles of plastic (we visit some of these in the show and they are quite overwhelming).

There are also test facilities for “chemical recycling” which tries to break the plastics back into an oil that, with refining, can then be turned back into plastic again. But this is early days and we need to make sure that these systems are not done at such a small scale that they are just a green wash to make plastic seem more recyclable than it is."

That's despite a really standout session for the miners, more than recouping some of the losses they posted yesterday — shares in Fortescue are up 5 per cent, Rio 's up 4.1 per cent and BHP has gained 3.8 per cent. Energy stocks are on the up, with Santos gaining 1.1 per cent so far. Despite the good performances, the gains across the broader index are being capped by falls in the financials sector — shares in Westpac have dropped 1.4 per cent. And most other sectors are posting losses as well. 119 of the top 200 stocks are in the red as it stands.",

The survey of more than 1000 people found that nine in 10 had come across at least one suspected scam in the past year. It comes as the ACCC warns of a new scam targeting customers of loyalty points programs. The text message scam is circulating to customers of the Qantas Frequent Flyer, Telstra and Coles' loyalty programs, according to the National Anti-Scam Centre, which has received more than 200 reports of the issue in the last few months. The ACCC warns people not to click on any links in text messages and to instead access websites or apps independently, including in the loyalty scam, which tells recipients their points are expiring. \"Many of us are worried about our friends and family members becoming victims of scams,\" Choice CEO Alan Kirkland says. \"The overwhelming majority of people in Australia want the government to force businesses to do more to protect people from scams. \"We welcome the government's commitment to consult on these issues over the coming months.\"",
