The CommBank Household Spending Insights index rose 0.7% in August from July, which was flat. The index is based on 12 spending categories and uses payment data from about 7 million Commonwealth Bank customers (which comprises about 30% of Australian consumer transactions). A increase in the number of international students meant spending on education grew 2.8%, while the FIFA Women's World Cup and big-name concert tours pushed recreational spending up 1.9%. Higher petrol prices drove up spending on transport by about 2%. However, the annual rate of increases is significantly down from its peak of 18% last yea r. CBA Chief Economist Stephen Halmarick says annual spending growth remains subdued as households manage the increased cost of living. \"The effects of the 400bp of Reserve Bank of Australia interest rate rises is clearly reflected in a significant slowdown in annual household spending growth measured by the CommBank HSI Index. Monetary policy is now restrictive and financial conditions will continue to tighten in the months ahead on the lagged effect of RBA interest rate hikes and the fixed rate mortgage refinancing task. We continue to expect household spending to weaken further over the remainder of 2023 and into 2024.\" Households spent less on hospitality and utilities (reflecting the government rebates available for energy bills).",

The ban will also cover the use of cryptocurrency and digital currencies. The Minister for Social Services Amanda Rishworth says it will protect vulnerable Australians. \"You can't use your credit card to place a bet for land-based gambling and the same rules should apply for online gambling too.\" Companies could face fines of up to $235,000 if they don't enforce the new rules. Financial Counselling Australia's (FCA) director of policy and campaigns Lauren Levin says it's a major win in the battle to reduce gambling harm. \"Digital currencies can have wild fluctuations in value, so not only do people speculate on their bets, but also on the movement in the digital currency.\" However, the FCA is disappointed online lotteries won't be included in the ban. \"Online lotteries have changed the whole situation, as the danger of losing large sums is now just as high as someone gambling on online sports betting. \"There is no good reason for online lotteries to allow people to buy a $10,000 ticket on credit, or for people to enter a $3,000 syndicate on credit. \"Gambling is gambling.\"",
