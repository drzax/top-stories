But that won’t stop the former president and his supporters from characterising the investigation as a witch hunt and an attempt to interfere in the 2024 election. Trump is still considered the leading candidate for the Republican presidential nomination, while Biden has declared that he’s also running for office again.",

OnePath is a superannuation trustee owned by Insignia Financial, previously known as IOOF, and has approximately 700,000 members and $35 billion in funds under management. It has been hit with infringement notices totalling $1.46 million for failing to direct 125 member contributions to a MySuper product from mid-last year onwards. \"In addition to today's enforcement action, APRA is closely monitoring OPC to ensure any members who suffered financial losses as a result of these breaches are fully compensated as soon as possible,\" APRA Deputy Chair Margaret Cole said.",
