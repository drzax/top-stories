              "plaintext": "Australia take on world number 63 Iran in the first of their three Olympic qualifiers in this window. On paper, tonight's game should be a pretty straightforward exercise for the Matildas: Iran are the lowest-ranked side in this group, and their players are largely still amateur or semi-professional, with few (if any) playing their club football outside of Iran. 2023 hasn't been super kind to them in terms of results: they've won one and drawn another of the four games they've played this year, while two other games were cancelled altogether. Their most recent national team fixtures came against Russia in June, both of which they lost 4-0 and 2-0. But it's Iran's journey off the field that is the most captivating part of their story. As I wrote when they made their Women's Asian Cup debut last year, it's been an incredible up-hill battle for Iran's women footballers to simply step out onto the field. In 2011, the country was banned from participating in a second-round Olympic qualifying game against Jordan because their players were wearing hijabs. Despite the fact that the coverings provided women athletes with the opportunity to participate in football in their country, FIFA took a different view, providing lots of reasons from religious to medical to safety concerns for why they couldn't be worn. Funnily enough, it was an Aussie - former Matildas vice-captain Moya Dodd - who was chair of the Asian Football Confederation at the time and helped to get the ban overturned, ultimately empowering millions of Muslim women around the world, from Iran to Indonesia, to take part in the game. We even saw the first hijab-wearing player at the Women's World Cup earlier this year when defender Nouhaila Benzina took to the field for Morocco. So although Iran might not get much further in this qualifying campaign, for them to be here at all is a testament to the strength and perseverance of generations of Iranian women, and a moment for Australia's Iranian diaspora to see their women's national team compete on our shores for the first time. That in itself is worth celebrating.",

Even now, a few months on, I still can't really believe it happened. Watching this video, I was immediately transported back to Lang Park, feeling the nerves twisting my stomach and shivering up my spine. I remember the noise of the crowd every time Australia scored and every time Mackenzie Arnold saved. I was so stressed I couldn't even sit down. The comments from folks under my retweet were filled with amazing memories of where they were, who they were with, what they were feeling. One study I read suggested that almost half of Australia watched this game, shattering the previous record for a single television event. Aside from Cathy Freeman at the Sydney 2000 Olympics, I really don't remember another sporting moment that stopped the entire nation like this one did. The Matildas had been on a steady upward trajectory in terms of popularity and visibility up until the World Cup, but this game really took them into the stratosphere. The ripple-effects have already begun, with the A-League Women breaking membership and attendance records in their opening two rounds, while some of its Matildas players like Cortnee Vine have become genuine celebs. The three Olympic qualifiers that Australia are playing in Perth over the next week are expected to do the same, with 20,000+ expected for the first and last games, while the second match against the Philippines could sell out the 60,000-seat Optus Stadium. For context, the last time the Matildas played in Perth - a 2018 friendly against Thailand - the crowd was just a smidge over 7,500. How times have changed, hey? What were your best memories of the Women's World Cup? Where were you when that penalty shoot-out happened? And how have you stayed engaged with the women's game since then?
