In his first broadcast interview since the ACCC alleged Qantas sold fares for cancelled flights, Mr Goyder conceded big mistakes were made but says new chief executive Vanessa Hudson is preparing to mediate with 1700 ground staff who were unlawfully sacked. Mr Goyder told the ABC's senior business correspondent Peter Ryan he's been busy meeting with major investors to win back trust and confidence. Mr Goyder is dealing with fallout on a number of fronts: •\tthe ACCC's allegations that Qantas sold fares for flights that didn't exist or had been cancelled •\tlast week's High Court ruling that 1700 Qantas ground staff were unlawfully sacked at the height of the pandemic •\tthe potential clawing back of Alan Joyce's pay (if the ACCC's allegations are proven the former Qantas boss could lose as much as $14.4million So with Alan Joyce \"gone\", the pressure isn't easing and in his first broadcast interview about the crisis, Richard Goyder is adamant about rolling with the turbulence for the long haul.
