So, should we expect wages to pick up again? They think so. \" Wage costs will accelerate further from here, driven by very low unemployment lifting individual and enterprise agreements and higher award and minimum wage gains across the public and private sectors,\" they said. \"But whatever the driver, wage gains are not being met with productivity gains, meaning unit labour costs will continue to rise, eventually forcing a reluctant RBA to lift official interest rates further. \" We continue to expect a peak of 4.6% before the RBA's hiking cycle is complete.\" The cash rate target is currently 4.1%.

To recap, wages grew by 0.8 per cent in the June quarter, and they're now increasing at an annual pace of 3.6 per cent (down slightly from 3.7 per cent in March). Meanwhile, headline inflation grew by 0.8 per cent in the June quarter, down from 1.4 per cent in the March quarter. So, the quarterly rate of growth in wages and inflation is now the same, if for a brief moment. Dr Chalmers and Mr Burke have picked up on that fact, while noting that the rate of growth in real wages is probably still a while away. \" This is the first time in three years that quarterly wages have kept up with inflation - and much better than the fall of 1.5 per cent in the March quarter 2022,\" they said. \"While there will be volatility in the next few quarters, Treasury expects annual real wages to return to growth in early 2024 .",

The PBOC lowered its seven-day reverse repo rate, a key source of short-term funding for banks, from 1.9 to 1.8%. It also cut the medium-term lending facility (MLF) rate from 2.65 to 2.5%, in the largest reduction since April 2020 (and we all remember what was happening then). Julian Evans-Pritchard from Capital Economics says it's the fourth round of across-the-board cuts this cycle, with the loan prime rate (LPR) expected to also be cut on Monday. \"On its own, rate cuts of this magnitude won't have a big impact,\" he notes. \"They only partially reverse the recent increase in real interest rates due to lower inflation. But the PBOC tends to use changes in policy rates as signalling tool, with the heavy lifting being done by other tools such as adjustments to reserve requirements and bank loan quotas. Today's cut suggests that these tools will be deployed too, consistent with the PBOC's promise of further monetary easing. \"But we think this will provide only modest support to credit growth and wider economic activity. \"Weak credit demand means that easier availability of credit probably won't drive much of a pick-up in credit growth. Instead, the additional liquidity is like to remain trapped in the banking system, as was the case last year. \"Reviving demand would take much larger rate cuts, or regulatory measures to effectively restore confidence in the housing market.\"",
