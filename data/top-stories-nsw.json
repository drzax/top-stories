They were wearing shirts that read End Fossil Fuels. At least one person glued their feet to the ground, making it harder to be removed, a spokesman for the US Tennis Association said.

Britain's longest-reigning sovereign died aged 96 at Balmoral Castle, leading to 10 days of national mourning for her record-breaking 70-year reign.

Chevron workers have been arguing for better pay and rostering, and had threatened to start strike action yesterday, before mediation talks were held by the Fair Work Commission. Now, union body Offshore Alliance says those talks have failed to resolve their demands, and strike action will begin from 1pm WST (3pm AEST) — including workers at Gorgon, Australia's second-largest LNG plant, and Wheatstone. The ongoing dispute between Chevron and its workers has been swirling for weeks, and follows the threat of Woodside workers threatening to walk off the job, which sent the price of LNG soaring globally. Australia is the biggest exporter of LNG in the world, and although it mainly supplies customers in Asia, the threat of industrial action has impacted prices in Europe, too. With the strike action now set to go ahead this afternoon, it could disrupt 7% of the global supply of LNG. Here's the full statement from Offshore Alliance's Facebook page: \"Despite the Offshore Alliance giving Chevron plenty of opportunity to sort out EBA's across the 3 Chevron facilities, they will finally be facing their day of reckoning. Protected Industrial Action commences at 13:00 today. \"Chevron are demanding they be given special concessions in bargaining — a demand which we have put through the shredding machine. \"Their bargaining performance has been the most inept effort of any employer the Union has dealt with in the past 5 years and our members have had enough. \"When PIA commences, plant on each respective facility will be shut down if there are not competent personnel to undertake handovers during work stoppages. \"It's game on, Chevron.\" Chevron has reportedly made provisions for when workers down tools. Woodside's dispute with its North West Shelf workers was resolved late last month, guaranteeing pay packets of more than $300,000 a year .",
