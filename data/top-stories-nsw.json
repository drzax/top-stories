The airline is anticipating an underlying profit before tax of between $2.43 billion and $2.48 billion for the current financial year. It has also increased its existing share buyback by up to $100 million. Flying activity increased in the second-half as new aircraft and more wide body jets returned from long-term storage, the company said in a statement. Jet fuel prices remain elevated but recent falls will deliver a cost improvement in the second half, Qantas said. The airline posted an annual underlying loss before tax of $1.86 billion in 2021-22 financial year. But it swung to a record first-half profit, earlier this year, as appetite for travel grew. It also said: \"As forecast, the steady return of total market capacity has seen fare levels moderate from peaks reached in the first half of FY23, but yields are expected to remain materially above pre-COVID levels through FY24, particularly internationally.\" In other words, airfares should get a little cheaper - but they'll still be much higher than they were prior to the coronavirus pandemic. In addition, there will be some changes to management. One of Qantas' directors Michael L'Estrange is retiring from the board. He'll be replaced by Doug Parker - the former chairman and CEO of American Airlines, who has more than 35 years of experience in the aviation industry.",

The US economy is at risk of crashing if no deal is reached in 10 days. The Democratic president and the top congressional Republican have struggled to make progress on an agreement, as McCarthy is pressuring the White House to agree to spending cuts in the federal budget that Biden has called \"extreme\". They have until June 1 to increase the government's self-borrowing limit or trigger an unprecedented debt default that economists warn could bring on a recession. Biden told reporters as the meeting started that he was \"optimistic\" they could make some progress. Both sides need a bipartisan agreement to \"sell it\" to their constituencies, he said, adding there may still be some disagreements. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen on Monday offered a sobering reminder of how little time is left, saying the earliest estimated default date remains June 1 and that it is \"highly likely\" that Treasury will no longer be able to pay all government obligations by early June if the debt ceiling is not raised. White House aides met with Republican negotiators on Capitol Hill for two hours on Monday, and early indications were that the talks had gone well. \"I firmly believe what we're negotiating right now, a majority of Republicans will see that it is a right place to put us on the right path,\" McCarthy told reporters. Any deal to raise the limit must pass both chambers of Congress, and therefore hinges on bipartisan support. McCarthy's Republicans control the House 222-213, while Biden's Democrats hold the Senate 51-49. A failure to lift the debt ceiling would trigger a default that would shake financial markets and drive interest rates higher on everything from car payments to credit cards.",
