              "plaintext": "AGL Energy has struck a deal with the Victorian government to keep its Loy Yang coal power station running until mid-2035 to provide Victorians with \"a higher level of certainty\". AGL signed the structured transition agreement which will allow the company to coordinate the retirement of the station — which is Victoria's largest electricity generator — with the state government. Last September, AGL brought forward the closure of Loy Yang by a decade to 2035, after buckling to the pressure placed on them by investors and lenders. The deal also allows for the closure of the coal-fired plant earlier than scheduled, provided it's not needed for \"the reliable and secure supply of electricity in Victoria\", as long as it was given the green light by the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO).",
