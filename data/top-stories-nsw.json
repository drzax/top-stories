At least 500 people, most of them foreigners or dual nationals and their dependents passed through Rafah, the only crossing that does not border Israel, Egyptian security sources said. Evacuations through the crossing were suspended on Saturday and Sunday after an Israeli strike on an ambulance that was heading to Rafah. Egyptian security sources said Egypt was continuing to press for increased aid and fuel into the strip and security for ambulances. Jordan's foreign ministry said 262 Jordanians were evacuated on Tuesday, out of a total of 569 that had been stuck in Gaza following the outbreak of fighting there. Canada said 59 of its citizens, permanent residents and family members were evacuated. Nineteen Gazans needing medical treatment were also allowed through, a medical source said, to join dozens of others who are being treated in Egyptian hospitals. Other countries with citizens cleared to leave on Tuesday included Romania, Germany, Moldova, Ukraine, the Philippines and France, according to the Gaza border authority. Reporting with Reuters",

But it looks like, after a four-month break, there's a good chance that the Reserve Bank is hoping it's one and done with yesterday's resumption of rate rises. That's the analysis from Westpac's new chief economist Luci Ellis, who was until last month the assistant governor (economic) at the RBA. \"We do not expect that the RBA will follow up with another rate increase in December. \"The last paragraph of the statement contained a shift in language from 'Some further tightening of monetary policy may be required' used in the October media release to 'Whether further tightening of monetary policy is required'. \"This reads as the Board hoping not to have to raise rates again, but being very willing to do so if things change.\" NAB's Alan Oster, now the longest standing big bank chief economist in the game, disagrees. \"Reflecting recent data, the staff's inflation outlook has been revised up and we now see one further rise as likely to balance the risks, pencilling in a 4.6% rate peak in February, though December is live,\" wrote NAB's economics team. \"Looking further ahead, given the resilience of the economy and labour market thus far, we now see rate cuts as unlikely to begin until November (previously August) with gradual cuts through 2025 and early 2026 to 3.1%, around the long-run neutral level.\" Personally, I quite like Peter Martin's analysis, published on the ABC News website this morning. With consumption and inflation still clearly trending down, and wages growth likely to have peaked below 4% per annum in the September quarter (ABS data out next week), I'm not sure the RBA even needed this rate hike.",
