It was around 0.3% higher in early trade and the ASX 200 closed 0.3% higher at 6,997 points. Healthcare was the frontrunner all day, closing up 1.7%. Sector giant CSL finished 1.7% up at $248.22, rebounding from recent weakness, while Resmed had an even better 3.1% rise to $23.87. Consumer cyclical stocks had a good day, after bets on US rate rises fell even further on Friday, taking some pressure off rate increases globally. Despite this, bets on a Reserve Bank of Australia cash rate rise tomorrow at 2:30pm AEDT continue to hover just below 60%. Utilities and financial stocks also had a good day, with Westpac's 26% rise in profit and $1.5 billion share buyback prompting a 2 per cent rise for its share price to $21.92, with the rest of the big four up between 0.5 and 1 per cent. Industrials, energy and mining were all down, although gold miners were amongst the best gainers, with South32 (-1.5%) and Rio Tinto (-0.9%) two of the major drags. Biggest gains: Iress +8.3% to $5.64 De Grey Mining +7.4% to $1.23 Lovisa Holdings +5.1% to $19.43 Evolution Mining +5.1% to $3.69 Bellevue Gold +4.8% to $1.43 Biggest losses: Block -6.3% to $76.10 Paladin Energy -5% to $0.955 Karoon Energy -3.2% to $2.44 Lynas Rare Earths -3.1% to $6.99 Computershare -2.9% to $24.41 That's it from me for today.
