Senator Lidia Thorpe made allegations that the Prime Minister and the AFP is not doing enough to protect her from the far right. “His violent force that he has sent to protect me can’t even protect me, refuse to protect the black sovereign woman because the police are part of the problem in this country,” she said. “You want to paint me as an angry black woman, well you are about to see an angry black woman. “For months I wasn’t allowed to be in my own home, because people want to kill me out there,” she said. In a statement earlier today, Australian Federal Police said they were investigating the threats against Senator Thorpe, but would not discuss the protection arrangements in place for individuals. The Prime Minister is expected to speak in Brisbane shortly, where he will be asked about the matter.",
