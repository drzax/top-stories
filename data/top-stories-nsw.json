Shrinking manufacturing industries in China, the Eurozone and the US also weighed on sentiment. Manufacturing in the Eurozone contracted in July at the fastest pace since May 2020 because of dropping demand. The Australian market is down more 1 per cent in afternoon trade, and the Australian dollar has lost 0.5 per cent so far today, dropping below 66 US cents, after taking a tumble overnight. In Japan, the Nikkei 225 has fallen by 2 per cent as chip makers weigh on the benchmark index, tracking a fall on the Nasdaq. Investors are waiting for the reaction on Wall Street tonight after Fitch cut the US credit rating. Yields on US treasury bonds fell on the news. Janet Yellen slams Fitch The White House has slammed the move saying it \"strongly disagrees with this decision.\" And US treasury secretary Janet Yellen also took issue with Fitch's move. “I strongly disagree with Fitch Ratings’ decision.\" \"The change by Fitch Ratings announced today is arbitrary and based on outdated data.\" \"President Biden and I are committed to fiscal sustainability.\" \"The most recent debt limit legislation included over $1 trillion in deficit reduction and improved our fiscal trajectory.\" \"Looking forward, President Biden has put forward a budget that would reduce the deficit by $2.6 trillion over the next decade through a balanced approach that would support investments for the long-term.” Congress agreed to a deal in June which suspended the nation's US31.4 trillion borrowing limit until January 2025. But Steven Ricchiuto, US chief economist at Mizuho Securities, says the US needs to cut spending. \"It's an unsustainable budget situation because the economy can't even grow its way out of this problem. \"Therefore, they're going to have to either tackle it or accept the consequences of potential further additional downgrades.\" with Reuters",

Employee households were most affected by rising mortgage interest charges, but higher prices for food, insurance, utilities, and housing increased the cost of living for everyone. The ABS says living costs for employee households rose 1.5 per cent over the June quarter, the largest increase of all household types. Over the year, living costs for employee households increased by 9.6 per cent, the most on record. Insurance premiums rose across house, house contents, and car insurance. Eating out, takeaway food, and fruit and vegetables increased, as did strong demand for rental properties which drove rents higher. The ABS' Living Cost Indexes includes mortgage interest charges, while the Consumer Price Index measures the cost of new dwellings. It says increasing interest rates saw the cost of living rise from between 6.3 per cent to 9.6 per cent, higher than the 6 per cent annual increase in the CPI. Mortgage interest charges rose by 91.6 per cent over the year.",

That compares to just over 13 million Australians who only hold one job, meaning that 6.6% of all workers are holding down multiple positions. Before COVID, the proportion of workers doing multiple jobs was fairly steady between 5-6%, but has remained above that level since December 2021. On average, multiple job holders worked longer hours than those with only one position. The average multiple job holder worked 30.9 hours a week in their main job and 9.6 hours in their secondary one, for a total of 40.5 hours — above a standard working week. Single job holders worked 35.5 hours per week on average. Men with multiple jobs worked the longest hours, on average, at 45.3, women with multiple jobs worked an average of 36.4 hours a week in paid employment. Women were more likely to hold multiple jobs (7.7%) than men (5.7%). Those aged 20-24 were most likely to hold more than one job (8.9%), while 7.9% of employed 15-19-year-olds also held more than one job. Only 5.5% of employed people aged 60-64 and 5.2% of those working aged 65 or older worked more than one job. Those working in agriculture, forestry and fishing, administrative and support services, arts and recreation, accommodation and food services, healthcare and social assistance, and education and training had the highest rates of multiple job holding (all above 7%). Those employed by utilities, financial and insurance firms, wholesalers, manufacturers and logistics firms were the least likely to hold multiple jobs (less than 5%).",
