Investors are looking out for the Reserve Bank meeting minutes, which are out at 11:30am AEST. They will provide greater detail on why the RBA decided to lift the cash rate target to 4.1% earlier this month (a decision which surprised markets). Later today, the RBA's deputy governor Michele Bullock will give a speech on \" Achieving Full Employment \", at an event hosted by the Australian Industry Group in Newcastle. Overseas, investors are looking closely at China as there's speculation our biggest trading partner will pump more stimlus into its slowing economy.
