              "plaintext": "The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) says steel manufacturer BlueScope Steel has been ordered to pay a $57.5 million penalty for attempting to fix prices for flat steel products supplied in Australia. The penalty ordered by the Federal Court today is the highest penalty ever imposed for cartel conduct in Australia. The Court also imposed a $575,000 penalty on BlueScope’s former general manager, Jason Ellis, which by Court order cannot be recovered from an insurance company. From the ACCC's press release: Justice O’Bryan said that “the conduct in the present case warrants a significant penalty to deter repetition by Mr Ellis and by others who may otherwise calculate that the rewards from such conduct outweigh the risks of detection. It is important that the deterrent effect of the penalty being imposed is not undermined by the ability of company directors and officers to insure against the financial cost of the penalty.” In December 2022 the Court found that BlueScope and Mr Ellis had attempted to induce eight steel distributors in Australia, and an overseas manufacturer, Yieh Phui, to enter agreements to fix and/or raise the level of pricing for flat steel products. “This should serve as a strong warning to all businesses and individuals that attempting to fix prices with competitors will have very serious consequences, even if the attempt fails and they do not reach an agreement,” ACCC Commissioner Liza Carver said. “We welcome this substantial penalty against BlueScope. It is important that penalties are sufficiently large to deter even large companies and their employees from breaching Australia’s competition laws.” “Cartel conduct is illegal because it cheats Australians by increasing the prices consumers and business customers have to pay, and by restricting healthy economic growth,” Ms Carver said. “If BlueScope had been successful in reaching an agreement to fix prices with its competitors, this would have reduced price competition and increased prices for flat steel products which are widely used in the construction, manufacturing, automotive and transport industries.” Justice O’Bryan found that the conduct by BlueScope was deliberate and systematic and considered that “only a substantial penalty for each of the attempts to induce cartel conduct will serve the objectives of specific and general deterrence”. He found that the conduct by BlueScope was of a serious kind, was carried out at a senior level of the company, had the potential to occasion significant loss and damage and to deliver substantial financial gain to BlueScope. BlueScope and Mr Ellis were also ordered to pay the ACCC’s costs.",

The fallout from the rejection has been simmering for days, and Assistant Treasurer Stephen Jones telling the AFR that the rejection was in the national interest and would keep Qantas profitable on Monday only reignited the debate. Speaking to the ABC's senior business correspondent Peter Ryan, Mr Turner said the federal government needs to be up front about who ultimately signed off on vetoing Qatar's bid. \"I believe the recommendation from the Department of Transport to the minister, Catherine King, was that it be allowed,\" he told The World Today. \"But the story is that it was someone above her that basically had a captain's call, presumably the Prime Minister. \"So it'd be interesting to know: who actually made the call, who made the decision, what the recommendation was, and what was the reason for it? \"Because these are questions that [have] just not been answered yet.\" He said people deserve an explanation to understand what was behind the government's decision making process as they face expensive airfares when booking flights. \"A lot of people, a lot of industries, you know, relatively small industries in tourism and travel have been negatively affected by this, [they're seeing] nothing of the relatively expensive airfares that we still have, because there's not enough capacity for the demand at the moment. So airfares are going to stay up ,\" he said. Mr Turner also believes the issue could end up \"blowing up on the government\". \"I think it could, if they can't give, what their rationale was, what the reason was, who made the decision and why,\" he said.",

In July it was revealed that Transport Minister Catherine King had rejected Qatar's application for 21 additional flights into Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane per week, on top of its existing 28 weekly flights into Australia's major airports. Yesterday, the Australian Financial Review published comments from Assistant Treasurer Stephen Jones, who explained the government's decision to block the extra Qatar flights was in the national interest and would help keep Qantas profitable. During a Senate committee hearing in Melbourne yesterday, Qantas boss Alan Joyce denied twisting the government's arm on rejecting Qatar's proposal, but Mr Turner told The World Today the reasoning doesn't stack up, because there is a need for flight capacity to increase. \"There's no logic to it, and it is a bit of a worry because we have more demand than capacity ,\" he told the ABC's senior business correspondent Peter Ryan. \"So any extra capacity that certainly for our industry is very important. \"It was clearly not in the national interest as far as I can see. \"You could argue that it could have been in Qantas's interests, it certainly wasn't in Virgin's interest because they have a codeshare relationship with Qatar, so I just don't think it was an argument that held any water .\"",
