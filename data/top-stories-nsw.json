Ben Whishaw won leading actor for his portrayal of Adam Kay in autobiographical drama This is Going to Hurt, while Adeel Akhtar won the BAFTA for supporting actor for his role in the crime drama Sherwood. Derry Girls won in scripted comedy, with Sister Michael actress Siobhán McSweeney winning for female performance in a comedy programme. Entertainment performance was won by Claudia Winkleman for The Traitors, which won for reality and constructed factual. But the memorable moment award, the only award voted for by the public, was won by Paddington and Queen Elizabeth II's Party at the Palace sketch for the late monarch's jubilee … … and Paddington is pretty excited about it.
