The three major indexes gave up earlier advances, losing momentum as the session progressed and investors digested the data ahead of the long US holiday weekend. The S & P 500 and the Dow ended modestly green, while the tech-laden Nasdaq closed nearly unchanged. All three indexes notched gains on the week. \"Today, people are coasting into the holiday weekend with relief that the job numbers were solid,\" said Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist at Carson Group in Omaha. \"There are signs of the economy slowing, which is what the Fed wants to see,\" Detrick added. \"It likely opens the door for no rate hike at the next Fed meeting in three weeks.\" The Labor Department's payrolls report showed the US economy added more jobs than expected last month, but the rising unemployment and participation rates, along with a welcome cool-down in average hourly wage growth, solidified expectations that the Fed will let key interest rates stand this month. Financial markets are pricing in a 93 per cent likelihood of such a pause this month, according to CME's FedWatch tool. But what the Fed will do beyond September remains an open question.",

The federal government quashed a request from the airline to allow additional flights per week into Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane. Acting Queensland Labor Premier Steven Miles says additional flights would push prices down — and he would have approved the request if it was up to state governments. But Employment Minister Tony Burke insists there is no need for a review. \"The decision [has] been made by Minister (Catherine) King, based on the national interest, that decision, I have got no reason to question that at all,\" he said. Meanwhile, Nationals senator Bridget McKenzie wants to launch a Senate inquiry into the government's decision. Senator McKenzie says after not getting answers from the transport minister, she will today call for a Senate inquiry on the issue — also accusing the government of being too cosy with Qantas. \"In the absence of her answering the questions and coming clean, it's very easy to assume that this government is continuing to run a protection racket for the most complained about company in our country, when you look at the ACCC figures,\" she said.",

Political reporter Evelyn Manfield explains what's being debated: This is the second tranche of the government's industrial relations reform. Under the change, the Fair Work Act would be amended to close a so-called loophole where an employer and employees have agreed through an enterprise agreement to a particular rate of pay, but then that pay is undercut when the employer brings in different workers through labour hire. The bill is also promising to introduce greater protections for gig economy workers and casuals, and increase penalties for wage theft. But business groups are opposing the changes, arguing they add complexity and will drive up costs. Political reporter Stephanie Borys was on News Breakfast earlier and said the bill will be debated for four weeks in the House of Representatives before it goes to the Senate where the government needs to find the numbers from the Greens and crossbench to get it through.",
