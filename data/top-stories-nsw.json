The late Gumatj clan leader and former Australian of the Year passed away earlier this year at age 74. Mr Dutton was speaking at a press conference in Adelaide, where he made a link between YunupiÅu's achievements in helping improve economic outcomes for his YolÅu people, and how that was a reason Australia should vote against the \"Canberra-based bureaucracy\" of an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Voice to Parliament. Indigenous Australians Minister Linda Burney called for Mr Dutton to apologise, accusing him of using the late leader's \"name in vain\" and of making inaccurate references to East Arnhem Land. YunupiÅu's brother and now-leader of the Gumatj clan Djawa YunupiÅu released a short statement in relation to Mr Dutton's comments, via the Yothu Yindi Foundation. \"It saddens our family to see my brother's name and legacy twisted like this,\" Mr YunupiÅu said. \"He was a strong advocate for the Voice, and Mr Dutton knows that. \"He heard the same message loud and clear when he met with the 13-clan leadership of the Dilak Council, who also support a Voice.\" Djawa YunupiÅu and the Dilak Council offered their unequivocal support towards a Voice to Parliament at the Garma Festival in north-east Arnhem Land earlier this year. Mr Dutton has been approached for further comment. NOTE: YunupiÅu's surname and image are used in accordance with the wishes of his family.",
