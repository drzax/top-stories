Hi Natty — even if you haven't been a Latitude customer directly, you might have applied for a financial product with them years ago, before they were even known as Latitude Financial. Before the Latitude brand became a household name (and a feature on the back of the Richmond Tigers guernsey, if you're AFL inclined like myself), they were GE Money — and have quite the history, including as Coles and Myer-branded credit cards. I did a deep dive on Latitude's history back in April, which you can read below.

The company self-reported the underpayments — which date back to 2010 — last week. It has estimated correcting the issue will cost more than $400 million, with superannuation and interest. Fair Work Ombudsman, Sandra Parker, has told ABC Radio Perth it may well be an oversight, but is disappointed by the company's \"negligence\". \"Our concern is how can there be an oversight and a mistake that runs for 13 years without there being negligence and neglect on the part of the company,\" she said. \"BHP itself said it's not good enough — that's right, it's not good enough for any employer — let alone one of Australia's largest and most sophisticated employers to underpay their employees on such a large scale.\"",

Markets are hinting at a pause, as is one survey by financial comparison website Finder, who surveyed 39 experts and economists. More than half of those surveyed believe the cash rate will hold at the current rate of 3.85%, but senior economics lecturer at the University of Melbourne, Tomasz Wozniak thinks the cash rate could go up by 0.15 percentage points. \"The inflation is high and way above the RBA's targets,\" he said. \"It increased monthly from 6.4 to 6.8% in May. Quarterly, in seasonally adjusted terms, that's still 7.3%, it's very high. \"Prices in all groups of expenditures increased, especially in groceries and housing.\" Mr Wozniak said he'd be \"surprised\" if they didn't increase the cash rate. \"That would be working probably against their statutory obligation to curb the inflation and keeping the GDP or the Australian economy in pretty good shape,\" he said.",
