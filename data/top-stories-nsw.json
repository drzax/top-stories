              "plaintext": "A review by the corporate regulator, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, has found First Nations bank customers are paying up to $3000 in overdraw fees a year. The review looked at the cost of high fee and low fee transaction accounts offered by some of Australia's major and regional banks. It found that many Indigenous customers were in high fee accounts, despite being eligible for a low fee basic account. More than 110,000 customers in areas with a higher than average proportion of Indigenous people and receiving AbStudy payments (a living allowance for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students) were in high fee accounts. These customers paid more than $6 million in fees annually, which could have been avoided if they were in a low fee account. ASIC commissioner Danielle Press says the regulator has written to banks telling them to switch customers to cheaper accounts, and improve the situation for Indigenous customers. \"Current processes to transfer eligible customers to low-fee accounts are overwhelmingly ineffective.\" \"We are asking banks when they will migrate eligible customers to low-fee accounts, and whether they will remediate impacted customers.\" \" We are also asking what changes will be made to ensure tailored Indigenous services are effective.\" \" We will be monitoring these issues to ensure changes are made and will prepare a report on this project later in 2023.\" The review found that banks knew there were a high number of customers that were eligible for low fee accounts, but they did little to transfer them to cheaper accounts with switching rates for most banks between 0.5 per cent to 3 per cent.",
