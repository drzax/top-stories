US officials have revealed further \"underwater noises\" have been detected in the search for a sub still missing in the Atlantic Ocean with five people on board. A Canadian P3 aircraft using sonar buoys yesterday picked up what two US media outlets described as \"banging\" sounds. The Coast Guard in Boston says further noises have been detected today but it's still too early to say whether or not they're connected to the sub. \"When you're in the middle of a search and rescue case, you always have hope.
