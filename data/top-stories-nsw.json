On Close of Business, in the age of global decarbonisation, Rachel Pupazzoni speaks to specialist energy economist from Victoria University Bruce Mountain, about whether Australia can be a renewable energy super power. With Snowy Hydro 2.0 facing a massive cost blow out and the New South Wales government in talks with Origin Energy to delay the closure of the coal fired Eraring power plant, Dr Mountain says \" Australia has the ingredients to be a low cost energy producer, but government policy has not allowed the best transition to renewables so far\". Also on the program, a look back on the week that saw Qantas boss Alan Joyce step down early, and the Reserve Bank governor Philip Lowe concede the bank went too far with its support of the economy through the lockdowns in 2020 and 2021. You can watch the program tonight on the ABC News Channel at 9:30pm AEST or as it repeats on Saturday and Sunday, or you can catch it any time on ABC iView .",
