One person is dead in Mexico amid reports of flash flooding in the peninsula, where some roads were swept away and images on social media showed raging torrents gushing down city streets that have been turned into rivers. In the United States, the storm is already wreaking havoc on flights and sporting events before it's even arrived, and officials are warning residents to remain indoors and keep emergency supplies handy. Though Hilary has been weakening over the last 48 hours as it nears land, it is still set to be the wettest storm ever to hit the US Southwest, according to Zack Taylor, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service (NWS). \"This is a dangerous storm,\" he says. \"It's not just the rain totals but the intensity.\" Reuters is reporting that Hilary is set to dump vast amounts of water on many parts of the US Southwest that are more accustomed to dry conditions. Areas such as Palm Springs, California, which typically gets around 116 millimetres of rain in an entire year, could receive 152mm to 254mm from this one storm. California's Death Valley area, which receives only about 55 millimetres of rain per year, could receive 76-101 millimetres of rain from this event.",
