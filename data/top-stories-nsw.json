On its website, Active Super claimed not to invest in industries that threatened the environment and the community — meaning it didn't invest funds in tobacco manufacturing, gambling, coal mining and oil tar sands. The super fund also said it added Russia to its list of excluded countries after it illegally invaded Ukraine last year. But ASIC alleges Active Super \"exposed its members to investments it claimed to restrict or eliminate\", claiming it had 28 holdings, directly or indirectly, that contradicted its ethical stance, between February 1, 2021 and June 30, 2023. Those holdings included: Gambling : Skycity Entertainment Group Limited, PointsBet Holdings Limited, The Star Entertainment Group Limited, The Lottery Corporation Limited and Tabcorp Holdings Limited; Tobacco : Amcor PLC; Russian entities : Gazprom PJSC and Rosneft Oil Company; Oil Tar Sands : ConocoPhillips; Coal Mining : Coronado Global Resources Inc., New Hope Corporation Limited and Whitehaven Coal Limited. ASIC also alleges Active Super claimed it would stop investing in Russian companies from May 2022, but holdings in Russian securities remained in place as of the end of June 2023. \"There is much competition among super funds for new members, and we know that funds seek to attract members with promises their investments will not be exposed to certain industries,\" said Sarah Court, ASIC's Deputy Chair. \"When making these claims super funds must have evidence to back their claims and ensure they are not promising exclusions that they cannot guarantee.\" It's the third greenwashing civil penalty ASIC has launched, after taking action against Mercer Super and Vanguard. A spokesperson for Active Super said the fund has cooperated with ASIC's investigation, and \" welcomes increased scrutiny on ESG disclosure standards as being good for members, the super industry and the community\". \"As the matter is before the courts we are unable to comment further,\" the spokesperson said.",

That date would have the trial get underway just two weeks before the first votes are cast in the 2024 Republican presidential primary, a race in which Trump is the frontrunner. US Special Counsel Jack Smith's office asked a judge in a court filing on Thursday to start the trial on January 2 in part due to the public's interest in a speedy trial. Smith's office said interest was \"of particular significance here, where the defendant, a former president, is charged with conspiring to overturn the legitimate results of the 2020 presidential election, obstruct the certification of the election results, and discount citizens’ legitimate votes.\" A spokesperson for Trump says Smith and the Justice Department \"are blatantly playing political games\", citing Trump's status as a frontrunner in the 2024 election. Prosecutors predict it will take about four to six weeks to put forward the bulk of their case against Trump at trial. Trump last week pleaded not guilty to charges over the alleged election conspiracy.",
