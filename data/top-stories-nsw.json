He says the results were \"stronger than expected\" despite the weaker growth in household spending, but it \" highlights the tensions that continue to exist between monetary and fiscal policy settings in Australia \". Here's his full take on the figures and their meaning: \"National GDP grew by 0.4% in the June quarter, or a touch above the 0.3% gain expected by the market. Over the past twelve months, the economy has posted modestly below trend growth of 2.1%. \"Yet within the national accounts, household consumer spending grew by a mere 0.1% in the June quarter, to be up only 1.5% over the past year. Higher interest rates, courtesy of the RBA, are certainly doing their part in slowing down the consumer, which is a big chunk (50%) of the economy. \"Higher interest rates, along with ongoing labour and material shortages, have also helped slow housing construction, which fell 0.2% in the quarter and by 1.1% over the past year. \"Yet countering this effect has been strength in public demand. In particular, new public investment spending rose by 5.5% in the quarter, which as the ABS notes, reflects \"ongoing large-scale transport, health and education projects across a number of states .\" Indeed, major public infrastructure programs are also likely contributing to the labour and material shortages in the housing sector — adding to inflationary pressure and \"crowding out\" much needed growth in housing supply. \"While federal and state government commitment to infrastructure programs is usually a welcome development, the present timing of this public investment boom is unfortunate – as it runs contrary to the RBA's efforts to slow the economy and bring down inflation. \"All that said, today's stronger than expected GDP report is not expected to change the outlook for the RBA just yet .\"",

Mr Viney also said the figures would be in line with what the RBA was expecting to see. \"We also have to remember with the slowing in the economy, it's from a high starting point,\" he said. \"So growth was strong through 2022, so from a high starting point it's natural to get slowing, and then on top of that the RBA is looking for that slowing in demand to show those rate rises that they put through are working to bring a better balance between supply and demand in the economy. \"I think broadly these numbers would suggest, and certainly with that soft or broadly flat consumption number for the quarter, that would confirm the rate rises are having the impact the RBA is looking for .\" You can watch his full chat with finance presenter Alicia Barry below:",
