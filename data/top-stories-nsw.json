The ACCC claims eHarmony stated it offered \"free dating\", its memberships automatically renewed, and failed to display accurate prices, statements about \"one month\" memberships and early cancellation options. The watchdog alleges the conduct dates back to at least November 2019, and \"most of it is ongoing\". ACCC chair Gina Cass-Gottlieb says the watchdog has received \"hundreds\" of complaints about eHarmony and its memberships. \"We allege that eHarmony deprived consumers of the chance to make an informed choice about whether to join this dating service and how much to spend in doing so,\" Ms Cass-Gottlieb said. “We allege that as a result of eHarmony's conduct, consumers may have thought they committed to a plan of 6, 12 or 24 months when in reality the plan was longer because it automatically renewed, in some cases at a much higher price.\" Ms Cass-Gottlieb also said eHarmony's free membership had limited functionality that required customers to pay before being able to date, and misled members about their ability to cancel subscriptions. She added that eHarmony should have known about the need for clear information for members, as the ACCC consulted the dating site in 2016 when developing its best practice guidelines for dating websites. \"We are disappointed to have to take this action, especially since eHarmony should have been well and truly on notice about the need to provide consumers with clear and accurate information about their dating services,\" Ms Cass-Gottlieb said. The ACCC is also encouraging customers who experienced issues with an eHarmony subscription, or paid more than what was advertised for a membership to contact them via their website. eHarmony has been contacted for comment.",

Premier Li is China's second-highest-ranking official after President Xi Jinping, who has opted not to attend a series of global summits underway this week. There had been hopes Albanese might meet President Xi at the G20 leader's summit in Delhi this weekend, re-creating a significant meeting of the two leaders at last year's G20 summit in Bali. But with that no longer an option, it is now expected the PM will meet Premier Li instead. It's anticipated the two leaders would meet ahead of the East Asia Summit, which brings together South-East Asian leaders with leaders of countries like Australia, Japan, China, Russia and the USA. While diplomatic and trade relations between Australia and China have improved substantially in recent months, there are some substantial issues that might be raised. Trade barriers remain in place on Australian wine exports, and ministers have spoken out in recent months calling for their removal. Two Australians also remain detained in Beijing —\njournalist Cheng Lei, and writer Dr Yang Hengjun. The government has openly called for both Australians to be reunited with their families, and Foreign Minister Penny Wong yesterday told the ABC that officials were continuing that pressure. \"We are deeply concerned about Ms Cheng Lei and Dr Yang, as are so many Australians,\" she said. \"And we have continued to raise with our counterparts at every level the desire of Australia to see both Ms Cheng Lei and Dr Yang reunited with their families. \"We'll continue to make those representations.\"",
