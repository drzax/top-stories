After the tech stock sell off on Wall Street overnight, the local tech stocks on the ASX led its lower performance for the day, with the technology sector shedding 1.1%. Xero slipped by 3.9%, Technology one and Life360 fell by 2.9%, and Block was down by 2.1%. Industrials were also down by 0.7%, and financials dipped by 0.5% — with all of the big four banks dipping in the range between 0.1% to 0.8%. Consumer non-cyclicals were the best performing sector, up 1.2%, and energy gained 1.1%. The top five performers for the day were: Ingenia Communities +4.6% Coronado Global Resources +2.8% Monadelphous Group +2.6% Endeavour Group +2.4% Flight Centre +2.3% As for the worst five performers: Mineral Resources -7.5% Lake Resources -7.3% Imugene -6% Syrah Resources -5.8% Newcrest Mining -5.3% And that brings us to the end of the financial markets for another week — thanks for joining us. We'll be back to do it all next week, when we will see the latest quarterly inflation numbers ahead of August's all-important RBA meeting.

Coronado's quarterly group saleable production is up 22% compared to its March quarter to 4.5 million tonnes, while its group run of mine (ROM) coal production was 15% higher to 7.2 million tonnes. Its revenue for the June quarter came in at $US728 million ($1 billion), with capital expenditure totalling $US48 million ($70.8 million). Although Coronado has flagged higher capital expenditure for the 2023 financial year, it's also expecting coking coal prices to remain well above the long-term average, and demand to continue to rise. Put that all together, and it makes sense why its share price is tracking up today — it's given investors something to be optimistic about.",

With only a few hours of trade left, it's looking increasingly likely the local share market will finish roughly where it started this week. A continued slide in tech stocks is a big driver behind the ASX's dip, with the technology sector down 1.1%, and the academic and educational, industrials and financial sectors each down 0.7%. Consumer non-cyclicals are up 1.1% though, while energy has gained 0.6%.
