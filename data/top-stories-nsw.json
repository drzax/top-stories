The Gaza Strip has been cut off from food, water and fuel supplies coming through Israel, with electricity also cut and several health facilities damaged in air strikes. \"We have seen devastating loss of innocent life since the heinous attacks on Israel by brutal terrorist group Hamas,\" Foreign Minister Penny Wong said. \"Far from representing the Palestinian people, Hamas undermines Palestinian needs and aspirations. \"We continue to call for the unconditional release of all hostages. We stand with Israel and reiterate its right to defend itself. \"President Biden has called on Israel to operate by the rules of war in its response to Hamas attacks — we join him and others in that call. \"We call for safe and unimpeded humanitarian access to civilians affected by the worsening humanitarian crisis in Gaza. \"We call for the establishment of a corridor to enable humanitarian needs to be met.

It's currently just before 9am in Gaza. The post on X, which includes a map, translated from Arabic into English reads: An important statement to the residents of Gaza City  In recent days, we have appealed to you to leave Gaza City to the south of Wadi Gaza in order to preserve your safety. I would like to inform you that the IDF will allow movement on the indicated streets without any harm between the hours of 10:00-16:00. For your safety, take advantage of the short time to move south — from Beit Hanoun to Khan Yunis. If you care about yourself and your loved ones, go south as instructed. Rest assured that Hamas leaders have taken care of themselves and are taking cover from strikes in the region. Residents of Al-Shati, Rimal, and west of Zeitoun will also be allowed to move on Daldul and Al-Seena Streets towards Salah Al-Deen and Al-Bahr Streets.
