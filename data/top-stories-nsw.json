              "plaintext": "From the ABC's senior business correspondent Peter Ryan, who was at the RBA lock-up in Martin Place, Sydney this morning: The Reserve Bank board is holding on to the risk of another interest rate rise this year if inflation remains stubbornly high and fails to slow in line with forecasts. But in decidedly dovish minutes from the RBA's meeting a fortnight ago, it's now increasingly clear the impact of 12 cash rate rises since May last year is working to slow the economy and cool inflation. In leaving the cash rate at 4.1pc on August 1, the minutes show RBA members were confident that the aggressive action was \"working as intended\" with monetary policy \"already tightened â¦ significantly\". \"The full effects or earlier tightening were yet to be recorded â¦ but consumption had already slowed significantly â¦ and early signs that the labour market might be at a turning point.\" But there was also debate in the RBA boardroom about the need to maintain the pressure with another rate rise as a hammer blow against inflation, now running at 6% over the year. \"The case to raise the cash rate centred on the risk that inflation might prove to be more persistent than currently forecast,\" the minutes say. \"Were this to occur, it would require the Board to raise the cash rate by more than otherwise to get inflation back to target.\" Members proposing the losing argument for a rate rise argued gains in the jobs market would need to be sacrificed to get inflation lower and hiking in August would \"mitigate the risk of that undesirable scenario eventuating.\" The minutes show members are also becoming increasingly concerned about a rebound in real estate prices. The RBA board also remains concerned that wages growth in Australia and around the world remains \"above levels that would be consistent with many central banks' inflation targets\". However, the minutes note that higher wages could be a one-off correction and might be partially offset by weaker corporate profit margins or faster productivity growth. In the background, concerns are rising that the health of China's economy created \"a high degree of uncertainty\". The minutes say China's outlook depends on a recovery in household consumption, support for the ailing property sector and the effectiveness of policy support from authorities in Beijing. Beijing has just injected RMB240 billion ($51 billion) into China's economy in response to growing concerns over the financial health of one of the country's largest real estate developers.",

              "plaintext": "The Australian share market is posting modest early gains, although Australia's two biggest miners have fallen further into the red on fears about Chinese commodity demand as one of the nation's largest developers teeters on the brink of collapse. This is the latest on the Country Garden situation from Reuters : China's largest private real estate developer Country Garden is seeking to delay payment on a private onshore bond for the first time, the latest sign of a stifling cash crunch in the property sector, piling pressure on Beijing to step in. Adding to worries about contagion risk, a major Chinese trust company that traditionally had sizable exposure to real estate, Zhongrong International Trust Co, has missed its repayment obligations on some investment products. Analysts warned that a rise in default by trust companies, also known as shadow banks, which have strong ties to the domestic property sector, will further weigh on the world's second-largest economy. Those fears have seen BHP and Rio Tinto fall around 0.5% in early trade, after steeper drops yesterday. Fortescue Metals is holding up, however, rising 1.1%. Industrials, energy and mining were among the sectors slightly in the red on the ASX 200 today, but big gains in healthcare and solid rises for tech, real estate and financials more than offset those losses. There are 109 companies on the up, compared to only 72 of the top 200 on the slide. The ASX 200 is up 0.3% to 7,300 points in the first 20 minutes of trade. The Aussie dollar has also stabilised, sitting at 64.89 US cents .",
