The impairment comes from increased debt costs and \"tightening market conditions\" for its cleaning and maintenance business Spotless, which caters to the defence sector. Downer EDI lowered its forecasts after lawsuits were filed alleging breaches of disclosures regarding a maintenance contract and the Sydney-based company revealed accounting irregularities in December. \"Downer is undergoing a period of significant and necessary organisational change. Against this backdrop, we have delivered underlying earnings in line with what was previously communicated,\" CEO Peter Tompkins said in a statement. Downer EDI posted its biggest single-day loss in six months, falling nearly 6 per cent, but has recovered some of that fall in mid-afternoon trade to sit a bit over 2 per cent below yesterday's closing figure.",
