On his visit he will call for the \"resumption of a genuine peace process\" for the creation of a Palestinian state and \"halting the colonisation\" of the West Bank while visiting Israel on Tuesday, his office says. \"The only way to be useful is to one, show solidarity to Israel; two, make commitments against terrorist groups very clear; and three, to open up a political perspective.\" Macron will also express France's \"solidarity\" with Israel and the French citizens living there, while also urging \"a halt of the colonisation\" of the West Bank as a result of Israeli settlements. The French leader's Israel visit for talks with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was announced late Sunday. Seven French citizens are still missing: one of them, a French woman, has been confirmed as among the hostages taken by Hamas. Macron says the others are also thought to be hostages, but there has not yet been confirmation. AFP",

On his visit he will call for the \"resumption of a genuine peace process\" for the creation of a Palestinian state and \"halting the colonisation\" of the West Bank while visiting Israel on Tuesday, his office says. \"The only way to be useful is to one, show solidarity to Israel; two, make commitments against terrorist groups very clear; and three, to open up a political perspective.\" Macron will also express France's \"solidarity\" with Israel and the French citizens living there, while also urging \"a halt of the colonisation\" of the West Bank as a result of Israeli settlements. The French leader's Israel visit for talks with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was announced late Sunday. Seven French citizens are still missing: one of them, a French woman, has been confirmed as among the hostages taken by Hamas. Macron says the others are also thought to be hostages, but there has not yet been confirmation. AFP",
