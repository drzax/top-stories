              "plaintext": "SQM Research, which does lots of property and housing-focused research, has put out an interesting note about the impact of today's rate announcement on the housing market. Last year SQM Research's managing director Louis Christopher published a \"Housing Boom and Bust Report\", which examined what the housing market might look like in each of the capital cities in the wake of ongoing inflation and rate rises. At the time, he looked at four possible scenarios, with variations of the cash rate, inflation peaks and the unemployment rate. Now he says given today's rise, there is only one scenario left, and it means we can expect to see more people selling their homes — and a fall in house prices from the second half of the year. \"While our numbers on distressed listings today remain largely benign (except for Tasmania) we can now expect distressed activity to rise based on a new round of forced and panicky selling starting sometime the 2nd half of this year,\" he said. \"This will particularly be the case if unemployment rises towards 5%. Naturally, the higher the unemployment rate, the more forced selling we will see. \"So, in our view, market participants need to be prepared for a new round of housing price falls starting in the second half of 2023. \"The price falls may not immediately occur, but the expectation is the spring selling season will be a tough one for sellers.\" But if you're a prospective buyer, Mr Christopher says to exercise some caution. \"Buyers need to be very cautious in this environment, especially for regional areas which were already weakening,\" he notes. \"But I doubt our larger cities will be spared much given the massive mortgage debts outstanding. \"As a potential buyer, spending some time on the sidelines, researching the market, isn't a bad idea, right now. \"All this is my opinion and forecasting, of course. No one knows the future and I have been wrong in the past indeed I'm partially wrong now as I expected the RBA to peak the cash rate at no more than 4%.\"",
