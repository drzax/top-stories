Its agricultural exports, like those of Russia, are also crucial for world supplies of wheat, barley, sunflower oil and other food that developing nations rely on. A month ago, the Kremlin tore up an agreement brokered last summer by the UN and Turkey to ensure safe Ukraine grain exports through the Black Sea.

The additional 200,000 homes are on top of the National Housing Accord target that was agreed on by state and territories last year, with $3 billion set aside for the fast-tracking of the builds. Speaking from the country music capital of Tamworth in northern NSW, Mr McEwan said the lack of housing is the biggest barrier that's standing in the way of businesses being able to fill job vacancies, and changes to the planning process across the states was needed. \"I'd say it's [housing] the biggest issue that we've got across Australia,\" he told the ABC's senior business correspondent Peter Ryan. \"So the government's spending time on it and it should be, I think, on the simplification of the planning process. \"That's not to say we want houses built in the wrong places, but the simplification, taking 5, 10 years to get a development up and running is just far too long in this environment and we need action pretty quickly. \"When you come out to places like Tamworth and you see the facilities out here, with the sporting facilities, the council facilities, you realise it’s well served, but it’s getting people into these communities and finding the housing ... that is the biggest problem .\" You can listen to Ross McEwan's full chat with Peter Ryan below:",

Profit attributable to Telstra equity holders was up 14.2% to $1.93 billion. The rise in profit was based on a 5.4% increase in total income to $23.2 billion. \"We remain disciplined on reducing our costs, particularly considering the external economic environment,\" said Telstra's CEO Vicki Brady. Ms Brady said her priority was to continue to improve customer experience and further reduce complaints to the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman, which the company said fell by more than a third on the previous year. Telstra also revealed that its current plan is to retain ownership of its infrastructure business, InfraCo Fixed, \"for at least the medium term\" after it was structurally separated out from the rest of the firm earlier this year, meaning a sale or public share float is off the table for now. The telco was cautious in its guidance, predicting total income should be slightly higher than current levels but could be lower ($22.8 to $24.8 billion), while underlying profits before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) of $8.2-8.4 billion would be slightly higher than this year's $8 billion result. \"While our cost reduction ambition is being challenged by high inflation, we still expect to achieve the large majority of this by financial year 2025,\" added Ms Brady. The company will pay a fully-franked final dividend of 8.5 cents per share bringing total dividends for the year to 17 cents, slightly up on last year.",
