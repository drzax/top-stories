It was the third fall in consumer confidence in a row with the confidence among the worst levels since the COVID-19 outbreak. Confidence fell in New South Wales and Victoria, but increased in Queensland, South Australia and Western Australia. ANZ says people are worried about high inflation and financial conditions. Confidence in current financial conditions fell by 5.7 points, while confidence that it was a good time to buy a major household item dropped by 0.8 per cent, after a 6.8 per cent fall in the previous week. ANZ senior economist Adelaide Timbrell says confidence among renters was at a record low, while it improved for those paying off their homes. \"The confidence level was among the five worst results since the COVID outbreak and has stayed below 80 for 20 straight weeks.\" \"The decline in the latest result was mainly driven by weaker confidence in ‘current financial conditions\" \" Among the housing cohorts, confidence fell to a record low for those renting.\" \"It improved among those paying off their homes but remained below 70, while it fell for those who own their homes outright.\"",
