The Government will allocate $234 million dollars in next week's budget to reduce harm caused by tobacco and vaping products, including to stop the importation of non-prescription vapes. Under the changes, all general practitioners will be able to prescribe flavour-free, plain packaged vapes to patients working to quit smoking. Speaking on Q & A last night, Butler said easy access to vapes had created a new generation of nicotine addicts. \"This is now the number one behavioural issue in high schools and it's rapidly becoming a serious behavioural issue in primary schools,\" he said. \"This is a very serious problem we're facing and it has exploded over the last few years. While we were focused on the pandemic, it has utterly exploded and we've got to deal with it now.\" Butler is expected to further detail the government's plans during a speech at the National Press Club from 12:30pm today ."

On Monday, a heavy presence of police converged in an area where police had reported a possible sighting of the suspect, but later 38-year-old Francisco Oropeza wasn't found despite a search by officers, scent-tracking dogs and aerial police. The false alarm was one of the first times since Friday's shooting in the rural town of Cleveland that authorities had announced a possible sighting of Oropeza. By Sunday evening, authorities said more than 250 officers from multiple jurisdictions had joined the search, and Texas Governor Greg Abbott put up $US50,000 ($75,000) in reward money for tips leading to Oropeza's capture. \"I can tell you right now, we have zero leads,\" said James Smith, the FBI special agent in charge."

A number of props, sets and costumes from beloved television shows will be sold in early June — from the bar where Sam Malone greeted customers on Cheers, to the pink outfit Barbara Eden wore in I Dream of Jeannie, to props used on the set of Breaking Bad. Other items up for auction include a tunic worn by Superman in the 1950s TV series, barware from Mad Men, and costumes from Star Trek. Comisar had dreamed of creating a museum to house his collection, but when that failed to come together, he decided it was time the items leave the temperature-controlled warehouses where he's been caring for them. \"I just decided these pieces should go back to the fans and let them enjoy them and then when that good day comes when a TV museum is effectuated, these pieces will be well cared for in the hands of passionate fans and collectors,\" he said."

The Government will allocate $234 million dollars in next week's budget to reduce harm caused by tobacco and vaping products, including to stop the importation of non-prescription vapes. Under the changes, all general practitioners will be able to prescribe flavour-free, plain packaged vapes to patients working to quit smoking. Speaking on Q & A last night, Butler said easy access to vapes had created a new generation of nicotine addicts. \"This is now the number one behavioural issue in high schools and it's rapidly becoming a serious behavioural issue in primary schools,\" he said. \"This is a very serious problem we're facing and it has exploded over the last few years. While we were focused on the pandemic, it has utterly exploded and we've got to deal with it now.\" Butler is expected to further detail the government's plans during a speech at the National Press Club from 12:30pm today .",

On Monday, a heavy presence of police converged in an area where police had reported a possible sighting of the suspect, but later 38-year-old Francisco Oropeza wasn't found despite a search by officers, scent-tracking dogs and aerial police. The false alarm was one of the first times since Friday's shooting in the rural town of Cleveland that authorities had announced a possible sighting of Oropeza. By Sunday evening, authorities said more than 250 officers from multiple jurisdictions had joined the search, and Texas Governor Greg Abbott put up $US50,000 ($75,000) in reward money for tips leading to Oropeza's capture. \"I can tell you right now, we have zero leads,\" said James Smith, the FBI special agent in charge.",

A number of props, sets and costumes from beloved television shows will be sold in early June — from the bar where Sam Malone greeted customers on Cheers, to the pink outfit Barbara Eden wore in I Dream of Jeannie, to props used on the set of Breaking Bad. Other items up for auction include a tunic worn by Superman in the 1950s TV series, barware from Mad Men, and costumes from Star Trek. Comisar had dreamed of creating a museum to house his collection, but when that failed to come together, he decided it was time the items leave the temperature-controlled warehouses where he's been caring for them. \"I just decided these pieces should go back to the fans and let them enjoy them and then when that good day comes when a TV museum is effectuated, these pieces will be well cared for in the hands of passionate fans and collectors,\" he said.",

Speaking on Q & A last night, Butler said easy access to vapes had created a new generation of nicotine addicts. \"This is now the number one behavioural issue in high schools and it's rapidly becoming a serious behavioural issue in primary schools,\" he said. \"This is a very serious problem we're facing and it has exploded over the last few years.

On Monday, a heavy presence of police converged in an area where police had reported a possible sighting of the suspect, but later 38-year-old Francisco Oropeza wasn't found despite a search by officers, scent-tracking dogs and aerial police. The false alarm was one of the first times since Friday's shooting in the rural town of Cleveland that authorities had announced a possible sighting of Oropeza. By Sunday evening, authorities said more than 250 officers from multiple jurisdictions had joined the search, and Texas Governor Greg Abbott put up $US50,000 ($75,000) in reward money for tips leading to Oropeza's capture. \"I can tell you right now, we have zero leads,\" said James Smith, the FBI special agent in charge.",
