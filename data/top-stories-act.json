The idea is to open up the ability for more casuals who do regular and predictable shifts to ask for conversion into permanent employment, which comes with benefits such as leave and redundancy provisions, albeit without casual loading. Business groups aren't happy about the idea. This is the response from the AiGroup's chief executive Innes Willox. \"Defining casual employment in a way that prevents or discourages an employer from offering a casual regular and predictable hours would be a mistake that would damage the economy and hurt both businesses and employees,\" he said in a statement. \"If we make it harder for employers to offer regular work to casual employees this will just result in less security, less certainty and less opportunities for workers. \"It won't help anyone if an employer is forced to convert a casual employee to a permanent job if one doesn't genuinely exist. The real risk is that employees will be laid off down the track. \"What little we know of the government's plans for causals appears to be a solution to a problem that doesn't exist.\" Mr Willox pointed to a recent research note prepared by the AiGroup's economic team, showing casual employment falling, not increasing. \"The rate of casual employment in Australia has been stable for some time. In the years before the pandemic, it ranged between 23.5 per cent and 25.5 per cent. The rate of casual work recently declined to the lowest level in a decade ,\" Mr Willox said.

After having announced Michele Bullock as the new Reserve Bank governor just over a week ago, he has now appointed Victorian public servant Chris Barrett as the next chair of the Productivity Commission. \"Cabinet has agreed to recommend to the governor-general that Chris Barrett be appointed the chair of the Productivity Commission for a term of five years,\" Jim Chalmers told a press conference. \"Chris's appointment recognises if we want to build a stronger economy, then we've got to build stronger economic institutions and that means renewing and refocussing and revitalising the Productivity Commission.\" Mr Barrett is currently the deputy of the economic division of the Victorian department of Treasury and Finance, with almost three decades experience working on public policy. Previously, he also served as Australia's ambassador to the OECD, executive director of the European Climate Foundation, and as chief of staff to former federal treasurer Wayne Swan, whom Mr Chalmers also worked for. \"His appointment comes after a rigorous merit based process which involved interviews with two departmental secretaries and the Australian Public Service commissioner,\" Mr Chalmers added. Mr Chalmers said Mr Barrett will start his new role in September, and thanked the outgoing chair, Michael Brennan. \"He has made a significant contribution to that institution and to the national economic debate,\" he said. \"And I'm grateful for that and for his time before that as a senior public servant and a ministerial advisor as well. \"Under Mr Brennan's leadership, the Productivity Commission has delivered more than 20 reports to the government.\"",
