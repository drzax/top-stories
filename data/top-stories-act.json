The company has been approved for a $150 million conditional loan by the United States International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) that will fund the capital requirements needed for its Balama Graphite Operations in Mozambique. The conditional loan commitment is subject to the completion of due diligence, negotiation of detailed terms and legal documentation, among other approvals. The DFC loan is for a maximum principal amount of $US150 million and a term of up to 13 years, with interest fixed at applicable long-dated US Treasury rates plus a margin. Syrah's managing director and CEO, Shaun Verner, said the loan approval demonstrates the importance of operation to the US and its critical minerals strategy. As a result of the loan, Syrah Resources has risen the most in 21 months, and is trading around $0.60.",

From November 9, businesses will be prohibited from proposing, using, or relying on unfair contract terms in standard form contracts with consumers and small businesses, under changes to the Australian Consumer Law. The changes mean businesses and individuals could face \"substantial\" penalties by the courts, instead of just having courts declare specific terms of a contract unfair and void. The ACCC's deputy chair Mick Keogh says the changes should motivate businesses to correct their contracts before the new penalties are enforced. \"There was previously little motivation for businesses to comply with the law, despite the ACCC's compliance and enforcement actions. We s trongly urge businesses to review their contracts now to ensure they comply ,\" he said. \"The test for whether a contract term is unfair has not changed. However, businesses now could potentially face substantial penalties for contravening the law. This will better protect consumers and small businesses who have limited bargaining power, expertise, and ability to negotiate or assess standard form contracts. \"While some of the changes won't apply to contracts until they are renewed, or a new contract is entered into, businesses should be proactive in reviewing their standard form contracts now .\"",
