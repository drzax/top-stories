The death toll in Derna alone has exceeded 5,300, the state-run news agency quoted Mohammed Abu-Lamousha, a spokesman for the east Libya interior ministry, as saying. Derna's ambulance authority earlier put the toll at 2,300. The startling death and devastation wreaked by Mediterranean storm Daniel pointed to the storm's intensity, but also the vulnerability of a nation torn apart by chaos for more than a decade. Outside help was only just starting to reach Derna on Tuesday, more than 36 hours after the disaster struck. The floods damaged or destroyed many access roads to the coastal city of 89,000. Here's what we know about the extent of the devastation so far, and what made this storm so deadly:",

The Ocean Explorer ran aground on Monday in Alpefjord in a national park 1,400 km northeast of Greenland's capital Nuuk, the Danish military's Joint Arctic Command (JAC) said. \"A cruise ship in trouble in the national park is obviously a worry. The nearest help is far away, our units are far away, and the weather can be very unfavourable ,\" JAC head of operations Commander Brian Jensen said. \"However, in this specific situation, we do not see any immediate danger to human life or the environment, which is reassuring.\" A spokesperson for Australian cruise operator Aurora Expeditions said in a statement everyone on board was safe and well. The JAC said its nearest unit was an inspection vessel 1,200 nautical miles away at the time of the incident, meaning it could reach the grounded ship by Friday morning local time at the earliest. The Arctic asked a cruise ship located nearer to the Ocean Explorer to stay in the area so it could assist in case the situation changes. Reporting by Reuters",
