Its figures also show the country has likely just had its warmest winter on record. Senior Meteorologist Angus Hines says Australia should expect warm days and nights in the months ahead. \"That really warm winter is really providing a bit of a springboard into spring and we're expecting to see by and large more of the same,\" he said. \"The trend is singing out very strongly in regards to temperatures over the coming months that we are again going to see significantly above-average temperatures across the vast majority of Australia.\" He says the warmer weather will bring with it an increased fire danger. \"People around the country, particulary in those fire-prone areas, are urged to assist and update their fire plan and get prepared for what could be a big fire season,\" he says.",

Some pharmacists opposed this measure and waged an aggressive campaign in the media to stop it happening, but they weren't able to. From today, nearly 100 common medicines listed on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS ) will have the option of a 60-day prescription. This means many patients can now receive twice the medication for the cost of a single prescription. But that's just the start.

Hopefully we'll see lots of bees in them soon. But to the market. Today's the trading day of the week and the ASX 200 futures suggest Australia's stock market will open lower this morning after Wall Street's major indices lost a bit of ground overnight. Yesterday, the business news cycle was dominated by the news that the ACCC had taken Qantas to court for allegedly advertising and selling tickets to flights the airline had already cancelled. It saw Qantas ' share price lose 2 per cent in value, down 12 cents to $5.91, which wasn't much really. Remember, the airline's share price hit $2.36 a share at the beginning of the pandemic in March 2020, and it's been slowly trending higher since then, in fits and starts. Later this morning, we'll get updated retail trade figures, and new lending indicators, from the Bureau of Statistics. That will give us a little more information about the \"health\" of economic activity (as old Keynesians would have categorised things, anyway).",
