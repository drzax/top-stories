The Royal Mint produced six effigies of Queen Elizabeth II on Australian currency during her 70-year reign. Assistant Treasury Minister Andrew Leigh says developing a new coin is a long process. \"There's a range of things we need to get right, the mint's dyes need to be appropriately tested, each of the dyes need to sustain some 200-to-300,00 coin printings, so all of that testing process is in place,\" he said. \"I'm keen to make sure we get a lot of those new coins out. I know for the vast majority of Australians this will be the first time they hold a coin that has a King and not a Queen on it, so it's a big moment.\"",

Liontown is currently the subject of a $6.6 billion takeover bid by US chemicals giant Albemarle. It's possible that Ms Rinehart's intervention could force Albermarle to amend its bid for the Western Australian lithium explorer. How much does Rinehart own? Ms Rinehart's Hancock Prospecting group now controls 235.5 million shares in Liontown (or 10.69% of the company). That's a significant increase from a fortnight ago – when Liontown revealed that Ms Rinehart controlled almost 170 million shares (or 7.7% of the company). Over the past two weeks, Ms Rinehart's company has been buying Liontown shares (at $3 per share). Albemarle is about half-way through its one-month period of exclusive due diligence – scrutinising the progress at Liontown's factility at Kathleen Valley (which is still under construction). Liontown said it would start producing lithium in around nine months.",

The Australian share market is likely to have a flat (or slightly weaker) start to the trading day, with ASX futures down 0.1%. However, it could rise as the day progresses, given Wall Street ended its day with modest gains (after dropping sharply for the past four days). In contrast, European markets fell moderately, including Britain's FTSE (-0.8%), Germany's DAX (-1%) and the Stoxx 600 (-0.6%). The Australian dollar was marginally lower at 64.2 US cents. The US greenback, meanwhile, rose to its highest in almost 10 months against a basket of currencies after the US Federal Reserve last week signalled it may have to lift interest rates further — and was likely to hold them higher for longer than investors had expected. Here's how one market analyst decribed the situation to the Reuters news agency. There is a \"tug of war between investors seemingly getting more concerned about 'higher for longer' ... and bulls wondering maybe we have seen the correction and we can start to build from these levels higher,\" said Chuck Carlson, chief executive at Horizon Investment Services. Over the past few weeks, share market investors have been feeling unnerved by what's happening in the bond market. There's been a sell-off in government bonds, causing their prices to fall and interest rates (or yields) to rise. One of the most closely-watched benchmarks, the US 10-year Treasury yield, climbed 10 basis points to 4.54% (on exectations rates will remain higher for longer). This is its highest level since 2007, just before the global financial crisis.",
