I've been crunching Qantas' bottom line, and it has made huge losses during the 15 years of outgoing chief executive Alan Joyce's tenure. Airlines are a tough industry, with wars, pandemics, natural disasters, and financial crises the main factors that drive away passengers. Over the past 15 years, Qantas has been hit by COVID-19, which shut down the global travel industry, high fuel costs, fleet writedowns, and the global financial crisis, when toxic investments in the US almost brought down the world's financial system. Qantas net profit verses losses breakdown From 2008 to 2022, Qantas lost $2.9 billion, which wiped out the profits it made during the period. The rebound from COVID-19 has seen the airline return to profit for 2023, making a record $1 billion for the half year. Annual net losses 2022: $860 million loss 2021: $1.7 billion loss 2020: $1.9 billion loss 2014: $2.83 billion loss 2012: $$245 million loss 2008 - 2022 Total annual net loss: $7.6 billion Annual net profits 2019: $891 million profit 2018: $980 million profit 2017: $852 million profit 2016: $1.029 billion profit 2015: $560 million profit 2013: $5 million profit 2011:$249 million profit 2010: $112 million profit 2009: $117 million profit 2008: $969 million profit 2008 - 2022 Total annual net profit $4.7 billion"

                  "articleBody": "The Transport Workers Union has issued a statement about Vanessa Hudson's appointment to Qantas's top job, warning she will face an \"uphill\" road to rebuild the national carrier. TWU national secretary Michael Kaine says standards have been \"shattered\" over the 15 years Alan Joyce has been in the role, and says Ms Hudson has a \"golden opportunity\" to correct the airline's trajectory. “Today’s announcement is by no means a sign of relief to aviation workers, especially the 1,700 illegally sacked ground workers still suffering on the sidelines. But this is a golden opportunity for a reset at Qantas,\" he said. “Over a decade Alan Joyce has systematically splintered his workforce and driven down standards to the point where Qantas is a shadow of what it once was. \"Joyce’s position became untenable because Qantas was treated as a corporate vessel for excessive executive bonuses and shareholder dividends. \"Vanessa Hudson must be courageous enough to steer Qantas back to its core purpose: high-quality service for passengers and investment in the hard-working people who built the spirit of Australia.\" Mr Kaine says the union's door is open for Ms Hudson to meet with worker representatives, and comes as the new Qantas boss told a media conference she was looking forward to developing a \"constructive relationship\" with unions."

CEO Brad Banducci said supply chains are slowly recovering, but notes that customers are becoming increasingly wary about the impact that ongoing inflation is having on household budgets. \"In general, customer spending is stable. However, v alue-conscious customers are becoming more thoughtful about their discretionary spend, trading into more affordable options such as our own brands and looking for additional ways to save in store or through our Digital, Rewards and eCommerce platforms,\" Mr Banducci said. The food sales arm of the business saw a 7.6% increase to $12.3 billion in the third quarter, with food retail sales growing by 7.4%."

Every capital city, with the exception of Darwin, saw a rise in real estate prices, led by Sydney. Regional areas also saw some minor gains. But against all logic and what previous experience has shown us, house prices appear to have not just stabilised but turned a corner.

                  "articleBody": "Good morning, it's Tuesday May 2 and you've found yourself on the ABC's markets and business blog — and what a day we have in front of us. Let's get the elephant in the room out of the way first: it's rates day. The RBA is meeting today to decide what to do with the cash rate, after leaving rates on hold at 3.6% in April. But we know that was a lineball call — in the meeting minutes published a couple of weeks later, the RBA board had considered another rise of 0.25 percentage points. So what could today's decision look like? Major banks and investors are widely predicting the RBA will leave the cash rate unchanged at 3.6%, with data last week showing inflation is slowly coming down. I'll bring you the latest on that decision when it happens at 2:30pm AEST, and all the reaction that follows. On the markets front, the Australian share market is looking to open lower this morning after ASX futures were down -0.1% to 7,336 points as of 7:30am. It follows a mixed performance on Wall Street overnight, with US financial markets largely dominated by the news that regulators had seized First Republic, before selling its assets to JPMorgan Chase to fight off another global banking crisis. First Republic is the third US bank to collapse in just two months, after Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank folded earlier this year. All in all, there's a bit on — pour yourself a coffee and let's see where the day takes us."

I've been crunching Qantas' bottom line, and it has made huge losses during the 15 years of outgoing chief executive Alan Joyce's tenure. Airlines are a tough industry, with wars, pandemics, natural disasters, and financial crises the main factors that drive away passengers. Over the past 15 years, Qantas has been hit by COVID-19, which shut down the global travel industry, high fuel costs, fleet writedowns, and the global financial crisis, when toxic investments in the US almost brought down the world's financial system. Qantas net profit verses losses breakdown From 2008 to 2022, Qantas lost $2.9 billion, which wiped out the profits it made during the period. The rebound from COVID-19 has seen the airline return to profit for 2023, making a record $1 billion for the half year. Annual net losses 2022: $860 million loss 2021: $1.7 billion loss 2020: $1.9 billion loss 2014: $2.83 billion loss 2012: $$245 million loss 2008 - 2022 Total annual net loss: $7.6 billion Annual net profits 2019: $891 million profit 2018: $980 million profit 2017: $852 million profit 2016: $1.029 billion profit 2015: $560 million profit 2013: $5 million profit 2011:$249 million profit 2010: $112 million profit 2009: $117 million profit 2008: $969 million profit 2008 - 2022 Total annual net profit $4.7 billion",

TWU national secretary Michael Kaine says standards have been \"shattered\" over the 15 years Alan Joyce has been in the role, and says Ms Hudson has a \"golden opportunity\" to correct the airline's trajectory. “Today’s announcement is by no means a sign of relief to aviation workers, especially the 1,700 illegally sacked ground workers still suffering on the sidelines. But this is a golden opportunity for a reset at Qantas,\" he said. “Over a decade Alan Joyce has systematically splintered his workforce and driven down standards to the point where Qantas is a shadow of what it once was. \"Joyce’s position became untenable because Qantas was treated as a corporate vessel for excessive executive bonuses and shareholder dividends. \"Vanessa Hudson must be courageous enough to steer Qantas back to its core purpose: high-quality service for passengers and investment in the hard-working people who built the spirit of Australia.\" Mr Kaine says the union's door is open for Ms Hudson to meet with worker representatives, and comes as the new Qantas boss told a media conference she was looking forward to developing a \"constructive relationship\" with unions.",

This is an exceptional  company full of incredibly talented people and it's very well positioned for the future,\" she said. \"My focus will be  delivering for those we rely on and who rely on us — our customers, our employees, our shareholders and  the communities we serve.\" Qantas will announce its new CFO to replace Ms Hudson \"in the months ahead\". We'll hear more from outgoing CEO Alan Joyce and Ms Hudson later this morning.",

Let's get the elephant in the room out of the way first: it's rates day. The RBA is meeting today to decide what to do with the cash rate, after leaving rates on hold at 3.6% in April. But we know that was a lineball call — in the meeting minutes published a couple of weeks later, the RBA board had considered another rise of 0.25 percentage points. So what could today's decision look like? Major banks and investors are widely predicting the RBA will leave the cash rate unchanged at 3.6%, with data last week showing inflation is slowly coming down. I'll bring you the latest on that decision when it happens at 2:30pm AEST, and all the reaction that follows. On the markets front, the Australian share market is looking to open lower this morning after ASX futures were down -0.1% to 7,336 points as of 7:30am. It follows a mixed performance on Wall Street overnight, with US financial markets largely dominated by the news that regulators had seized First Republic, before selling its assets to JPMorgan Chase to fight off another global banking crisis. First Republic is the third US bank to collapse in just two months, after Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank folded earlier this year. All in all, there's a bit on — pour yourself a coffee and let's see where the day takes us.",

I've been crunching Qantas' bottom line, and it has made huge losses during the 15 years of outgoing chief executive Alan Joyce's tenure. Airlines are a tough industry, with wars, pandemics, natural disasters, and financial crises the main factors that drive away passengers. Over the past 15 years, Qantas has been hit by COVID-19, which shut down the global travel industry, high fuel costs, fleet writedowns, and the global financial crisis, when toxic investments in the US almost brought down the world's financial system. Qantas net profit verses losses breakdown From 2008 to 2022, Qantas lost $2.9 billion, which wiped out the profits it made during the period. The rebound from COVID-19 has seen the airline return to profit for 2023, making a record $1 billion for the half year. Annual net losses 2022: $860 million loss 2021: $1.7 billion loss 2020: $1.9 billion loss 2014: $2.83 billion loss 2012: $$245 million loss 2008 - 2022 Total annual net loss: $7.6 billion Annual net profits 2019: $891 million profit 2018: $980 million profit 2017: $852 million profit 2016: $1.029 billion profit 2015: $560 million profit 2013: $5 million profit 2011:$249 million profit 2010: $112 million profit 2009: $117 million profit 2008: $969 million profit 2008 - 2022 Total annual net profit $4.7 billion",

TWU national secretary Michael Kaine says standards have been \"shattered\" over the 15 years Alan Joyce has been in the role, and says Ms Hudson has a \"golden opportunity\" to correct the airline's trajectory. “Today’s announcement is by no means a sign of relief to aviation workers, especially the 1,700 illegally sacked ground workers still suffering on the sidelines. But this is a golden opportunity for a reset at Qantas,\" he said. “Over a decade Alan Joyce has systematically splintered his workforce and driven down standards to the point where Qantas is a shadow of what it once was. \"Joyce’s position became untenable because Qantas was treated as a corporate vessel for excessive executive bonuses and shareholder dividends. \"Vanessa Hudson must be courageous enough to steer Qantas back to its core purpose: high-quality service for passengers and investment in the hard-working people who built the spirit of Australia.\" Mr Kaine says the union's door is open for Ms Hudson to meet with worker representatives, and comes as the new Qantas boss told a media conference she was looking forward to developing a \"constructive relationship\" with unions.",

So what do co-chairs actually do ? It's a mix of helping put together the exclusive guest list, working with top chefs to create a specific menu (often aligned with the annual theme) and creating an atmosphere inside the event by selecting specific decor. Plus, there's the traditional hosting element, with co-chairs often taking the stage to perform during the dinner portion of the evening. Phones are strictly off limits, so sadly we never get to see any performances or interior design choices."

This year, there will be roughly 400 guests — similar to recent years but still lower than pre-pandemic highs of 500-600. As always, Anna Wintour and her team still get to approve every guest. Back in March, gossip tabloid Page Six reported that in Wintour's bid to narrow the guest list, the entire Kardashian clan had been culled. But it looks like the rumours were false, as Kim Kardashian posted these photos with Karl Lagerfeld's cat, Choupette, after spending some time at his office to \"get inspiration\" ahead of the event. Personally, I predict we'll spot Kendall Jenner (she was featured on Vogue's May cover which paid tribute to Lagerfeld) and I hope and pray Kylie Jenner will debut her relationship with Timothée Chalamet because that would be INTERESTING."

                  "articleBody": "This year's theme centers on the late designer Karl Lagerfeld, who made an indelible mark on luxury fashion in his long career at Chanel, Fendi and elsewhere. He was also a self-proclaimed \"big mouth,\" publicly sounding off with fatphobia. He spoke against gay men who want to adopt children, migrants, sexual assault survivors, the #MeToo movement and \"ugly\" people, without apology. \"He offended people right and left, making as much of an art out of the cutting aside as the perfectly cut double-face gown,\" New York Times fashion critic Vanessa Friedman wrote soon after Lagerfeld's death. \"He judged,\" Friedman wrote, \"and knew he would be judged himself, but he didn't care. Rather, he embraced it.\" The choice of Lagerfeld for fashion's biggest night is not without critics. At the time of the announcement, actor and activist Jameela Jamil acknowledge his fashion genius but denounce his \"distinctly hateful\" remarks, often toward women. \"Why is THIS who we celebrate when there are so many AMAZING designers out there who aren't bigoted white men?\" Jamil wrote. According to the Met, Karl Lagerfeld: A Line of Beauty, will look at \"the designer's stylistic vocabulary as expressed in aesthetic themes that appear time and again in his fashions from the 1950s to his final collection in 2019.\" Lagerfeld died in 2019 at the age of 85."

So what do co-chairs actually do ?

Phones are strictly off limits, so sadly we never get to see any performances or interior design choices.",

This year, there will be roughly 400 guests — similar to recent years but still lower than pre-pandemic highs of 500-600. As always, Anna Wintour and her team still get to approve every guest. Back in March, gossip tabloid Page Six reported that in Wintour's bid to narrow the guest list, the entire Kardashian clan had been culled. But it looks like the rumours were false, as Kim Kardashian posted these photos with Karl Lagerfeld's cat, Choupette, after spending some time at his office to \"get inspiration\" ahead of the event. Personally, I predict we'll spot Kendall Jenner (she was featured on Vogue's May cover which paid tribute to Lagerfeld) and I hope and pray Kylie Jenner will debut her relationship with Timothée Chalamet because that would be INTERESTING.",

He was also a self-proclaimed \"big mouth,\" publicly sounding off with fatphobia. He spoke against gay men who want to adopt children, migrants, sexual assault survivors, the #MeToo movement and \"ugly\" people, without apology. \"He offended people right and left, making as much of an art out of the cutting aside as the perfectly cut double-face gown,\" New York Times fashion critic Vanessa Friedman wrote soon after Lagerfeld's death. \"He judged,\" Friedman wrote, \"and knew he would be judged himself, but he didn't care. Rather, he embraced it.\" The choice of Lagerfeld for fashion's biggest night is not without critics. At the time of the announcement, actor and activist Jameela Jamil acknowledge his fashion genius but denounce his \"distinctly hateful\" remarks, often toward women. \"Why is THIS who we celebrate when there are so many AMAZING designers out there who aren't bigoted white men?\" Jamil wrote. According to the Met, Karl Lagerfeld: A Line of Beauty, will look at \"the designer's stylistic vocabulary as expressed in aesthetic themes that appear time and again in his fashions from the 1950s to his final collection in 2019.\" Lagerfeld died in 2019 at the age of 85.",
