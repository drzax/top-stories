Their exits are in addition to the former four partners, who have previously been named as Michael Bersten, Peter Collins, Neil Fuller, and Paul McNab. PwC says the investigation found a number of specific examples where professional standards were breached, regarding the misuse of confidential information or other matters reviewed by the ATO. \"Furthermore, the investigation identified a failure of leadership and governance to adequately address the matters, either at the time or whilst the matters were under investigation by the TPB or ATO.
