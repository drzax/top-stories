It's the worst week the ASX has had since last September, and was dragged lower over uncertainties in China and rising bond yields in the US. For the sectors, real estate led the charge throughout the afternoon, up 1.7%, while utilities gained 1.2% and basic materials picked up 0.9%. Consumer cyclicals was the worst performing sector, down 1.2%, while technology shed 0.9% and financials dipped by 0.4%. As for the best performers, it was far and away Magellan's day thanks to its announcement of a special dividend of 30 cents a share, despite a worse than expected 52% drop in its full year profit. The top five performers for today were: Magellan Financial +13.6% Abacus Group +9.4% Goodman Group +7.1% Inghams +6% Amcor +5.6% At the other end, the five worst performers were: Imugene -16% Super Retail Group -6.9% Centuria Capital -5.9% Growthpoint Properties Australia -5.5% Sayona Mining -4.2% And that's where we'll leave the markets blog for the day â and the week. Thanks for your company throughout the day, or if you've been following along throughout the business week. We'll be back to do it all again on Monday, but until then you can catch up on today's developments below, or download the ABC News app and subscribe to our range of news alerts for the latest news.",

She unpacked the intensifying \"global selloff\" we've been seeing thanks to the Fed's latest minutes, where it mentioned that it still sees significant risks to inflation. But she's pointed out that the US Treasury has been printing a lot of T bills lately and fell behind government bond issuance, and will eventually result in Treasury shifting back to bonds â which poses a threat to sovereign yields. \"The increasing supply, and the decreasing demand for US sovereigns will be one major force pushing the US yield curve higher. And if the strong economic data translates into higher inflation, the impact on yields will likely be higher,\" she wrote. The impact of a higher US yield? A stronger US dollar. \" A stronger US dollar is inflationary for the rest of the world ,\" she wrote. \"If nothing, the energy and raw material prices that are negotiated in USD terms on international markets simply become more expensive when imports are reverted back to local currencies, and that, alone, is enough to push inflation higher in the rest of the world when the US dollar appreciates. \"The EURUSD fell to 1.0856, the AUDUSD slipped below 64 cents and the USDJPY spiked above 146.50. \"The correction is in play ... and we could see the US dollar retreat further into the weekly closing bell, but the stronger dollar trend is clearly in play and it is worrying. \"",

Iron ore futures are trading up on China's Dalian Commodity Exchange, and it's the seventh session in a row they've been edging higher. The reason? It's got to do with the fact China's steelmakers haven't cut production yet, despite the concerns that remain around long-term demand. \"Iron ore prices were up strongly on the back of news that steel mills in Hebei have not yet implemented production cuts,\"  NAB said in a note. The bank also said it was staying cautious on the 2023 outlook, as China steel production is expected to be capped at 2022 levels. Meanwhile, ANZ mentioned ina note that falling exports from Australia and Brazil have also squeezed iron ore inventories in China.",
