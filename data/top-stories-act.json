Current RBA governor Philip Lowe didn't let on much when asked about it yesterday either, except for the fact that he would be \"honoured\" to continue on in the job if he was asked. So who else is in the running to be the next RBA governor, if it's not Philip Lowe? Here's a quick snapshot of the people who are considered the front runners: Will we get any clarity about when that cabinet discussion (and announcement) today?

Bonza will no longer offer flights from its Sunshine Coast base to Port Macquarie, Coffs Harbour and Tamworth. Flights have also been cancelled from Toowoomba to the Whitsundays, and Cairns to Mackay. Instead, Bonza's chief operating officer Carly Povey said the airline would offer extra flights to popular destinations, including Melbourne and Albury. The airline will stop serving the affected routes from August 1 .",
