That's despite losing steam through the afternoon— here's a chart of how the All Ordinaries tracked over the session: Meanwhile, the ASX 200 rose 0.35 per cent to 7,334.6 points, with big banks and energy stocks doing some of the heavy lifting. Mining stocks were a drag on the market, limiting the gains, with BHP and South 32 in the red, alongside gold and lithium miners. And Fortescue and Rio Tinto shares ended virtually unchanged. Here's how the different sectors fared on the benchmark index: And the biggest individual stock moves: Tomorrow is set to be an interesting day, with the Reserve Bank rates decision at 2:30pm AEST. Market pricing suggests no change to the cash rate for a second month in a row but some economists, including those at the Commonwealth Bank, are betting on a final 0.25% hike. My colleague Kate Ainsworth will be on deck early with all the overseas market action. Have a good afternoon!"

My colleague Kate Ainsworth has analysed CoreLogic data and the median value of homes sold across the country increased by 0.5 per cent in April, following a 0.6 per cent increase in March. Given interest rates are paused and inflation has started to fall (at least in data, even if it doesn't feel like it) this is potentially the end of any slump in house prices based on rocketing rates. CoreLogic's research director, Tim Lawless, said that, despite the divergence, the figures suggested Australia's housing market downturn had passed. \"Not only are we seeing housing values stabilising or rising across most areas of the country, a number of other indicators are confirming the positive shift,\" he said. \"Auction clearance rates are holding slightly above the long-run average, sentiment has lifted and home sales are trending around the previous five-year average.\""

And, with the Reserve Bank of Australia lifting its benchmark interest rate from 0.1 per cent in May last year to 3.6 per cent over 10 consecutive moves — and some economists predicting another 0.25 per cent rise will be delivered on Tuesday — more Australians could fall into housing stress."

New data from the prudential regulator APRA shows just how substantial that heft is. The 'Big Four' - ANZ, Commonwealth Bank (CBA) NAB and Westpac (WBC)' - are unable to merge with or takeover each other. Check out their share of the mortgage market, they're the four on the left. Together it's 75.1% - more than three-quarters of all home loans in the nation. Fighting over the rest are Bendigo and Adelaide Bank (BEN) Bank of Queensland (BOQ) Macquarie (MQC) and others."

I know the markets in the US were up on Friday but this is the day before the RBA meeting and for the past few months investors have been really cautious the day before the RBA meeting.  Is this a sign that they think rates will remain the same? Is this uptick because of the US markets?  Or is there some secret alchemy at work, like Mars is transversing Venus while the sea urchins mate in Turkey?  - Trying to find rhyme or reason. The ASX 200 is up 0.5% in morning trade, lifting 41 points to be 7,350.20 points. The broader All Ordinaries Index of the biggest 500 companies is up 0.5% too, rising 40.5 points to be 7,541.50 points But why? This is a good question. Our commentator makes some solids suggestions as to why. The real answer is: no-one knows. The market is composed of millions of transactions where people transfer the ownership of stocks. There aren't really 'more buyers than sellers' as you sometimes hear - one must meet the other to make the trade, so the number is the same. All of this leans towards the Mars/Venus/Turkish sea urchins theory being the best answer."

                  "articleBody": "Look, the most important day is always today. But with the RBA meeting tomorrow and the Federal Budget next week, let's look ahead a bit. The biggest bank in the nation, the Commonwealth Bank, has put out its preview of next Tuesday's budget and it spells out some assumptions that will help you frame the size of the challenge facing the nation. Here's what the bank says the government is trying to do, at the same time: maintaining fiscal discipline to assist monetary policy in bringing inflation back to the 2%-3% target range providing some targeted relief to cost-of-living pressures putting in place new arrangements to reverse the projected blowout in spending on a number of large programs (ie. NDIS, Aged care) implementing the AUKUS defence policy priorities further developing climate change policies implementing some tax reform and moving the medium-term budget outlook onto a more sustainable footing And don't forget — win the next election so you can start working on the really hard stuff! That said, there's some good news for Treasurer Jim Chalmers. There was a budget last year — in October 2022 — to enact a lot of election promises. The 2022/23 budget deficit is expected to come in well below the estimate that was made then. Data to March shows the 2022/23 deficit running at $A11.2 billion \"a substantial $A23.3 billion lower than expectations\". If you roll it over 12 months like in this chart, the budget is back to a (very) small surplus — mainly thanks to the strong labour market and company profits."

My colleague Kate Ainsworth has analysed CoreLogic data and the median value of homes sold across the country increased by 0.5 per cent in April, following a 0.6 per cent increase in March. Given interest rates are paused and inflation has started to fall (at least in data, even if it doesn't feel like it) this is potentially the end of any slump in house prices based on rocketing rates. CoreLogic's research director, Tim Lawless, said that, despite the divergence, the figures suggested Australia's housing market downturn had passed. \"Not only are we seeing housing values stabilising or rising across most areas of the country, a number of other indicators are confirming the positive shift,\" he said. \"Auction clearance rates are holding slightly above the long-run average, sentiment has lifted and home sales are trending around the previous five-year average.\"",

New data from the prudential regulator APRA shows just how substantial that heft is.

Or is there some secret alchemy at work, like Mars is transversing Venus while the sea urchins mate in Turkey?  - Trying to find rhyme or reason. The ASX 200 is up 0.5% in morning trade, lifting 41 points to be 7,350.20 points. The broader All Ordinaries Index of the biggest 500 companies is up 0.5% too, rising 40.5 points to be 7,541.50 points But why? This is a good question. Our commentator makes some solids suggestions as to why. The real answer is: no-one knows. The market is composed of millions of transactions where people transfer the ownership of stocks. There aren't really 'more buyers than sellers' as you sometimes hear - one must meet the other to make the trade, so the number is the same. All of this leans towards the Mars/Venus/Turkish sea urchins theory being the best answer.",

The biggest bank in the nation, the Commonwealth Bank, has put out its preview of next Tuesday's budget and it spells out some assumptions that will help you frame the size of the challenge facing the nation. Here's what the bank says the government is trying to do, at the same time: maintaining fiscal discipline to assist monetary policy in bringing inflation back to the 2%-3% target range providing some targeted relief to cost-of-living pressures putting in place new arrangements to reverse the projected blowout in spending on a number of large programs (ie. NDIS, Aged care) implementing the AUKUS defence policy priorities further developing climate change policies implementing some tax reform and moving the medium-term budget outlook onto a more sustainable footing And don't forget — win the next election so you can start working on the really hard stuff! That said, there's some good news for Treasurer Jim Chalmers. There was a budget last year — in October 2022 — to enact a lot of election promises. The 2022/23 budget deficit is expected to come in well below the estimate that was made then. Data to March shows the 2022/23 deficit running at $A11.2 billion \"a substantial $A23.3 billion lower than expectations\". If you roll it over 12 months like in this chart, the budget is back to a (very) small surplus — mainly thanks to the strong labour market and company profits.",

That's despite losing steam through the afternoon— here's a chart of how the All Ordinaries tracked over the session: Meanwhile, the ASX 200 rose 0.35 per cent to 7,334.6 points, with big banks and energy stocks doing some of the heavy lifting. Mining stocks were a drag on the market, limiting the gains, with BHP and South 32 in the red, alongside gold and lithium miners. And Fortescue and Rio Tinto shares ended virtually unchanged. Here's how the different sectors fared on the benchmark index: And the biggest individual stock moves: Tomorrow is set to be an interesting day, with the Reserve Bank rates decision at 2:30pm AEST. Market pricing suggests no change to the cash rate for a second month in a row but some economists, including those at the Commonwealth Bank, are betting on a final 0.25% hike.
