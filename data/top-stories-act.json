Mr Speirs urged people to \"remain respectful and decent\" during the voting process. \"This is an important part of democracy and we ought to respect it and respect each other's views,\" he said. Mr Speirs said South Australians he had spoken to were \"confused\" about the Voice. \"They're really concerned about the serious lack of detail that has been put on the table by the prime minister. And the prime minister is going to have a lot of questions to answer on Sunday morning if, as predicted, the referendum is defeated across Australia,\" he said. Ms Liddle, an Arrernte woman, said people should focus on the facts when they make their decision, not emotion. \"It is about a whole new chapter in our constitution, in our nation's rulebook, and anything you do to our rulebook has consequences,\" she said. \"That's why Australians have been very careful historically in making any change to our rulebook — and they should be. \"And they should be really careful on this one too, because they shouldn't be voting on emotion. \"They shouldn't be voting because they feel like they're being intimidated, harassed, or ashamed or guilted. None of those things should come into play here.\"",

As you will see, Wall Street ended in the red and the futures for Australian markets show we will likely follow. The CPI data shows that price hikes aren't over in the world's biggest economy, with headline rising above consensus estimates by 0.3% a month and core inflation about the same. That, of course, is creating concern that the US federal reserve will raise rates again to tackle price spikes. This note from CBA this morning: Notwithstanding, we doubt the downtrend in inflation has been thrown off course.  The outlook for the US consumer is poor given the resumption of student loan repayments, lower government benefit payments, and the erosion of pandemic savings.  At the same time, interest rates on consumer loans have risen sharply to very high levels.  Indeed, some FOMC officials have recently said the rise in yields may substitute for further FOMC tightening.  Our baseline remains for the FOMC to keep the Funds rate steady into early 2024.  We consider the FOMC’s significant policy tightening will lead the global economy into recession. Recession fears are also being sparked by the devastating crisis in the Middle East. Here is a piece by our business reporter Nassim Khadem to get you started this morning.",

The outlook for the US consumer is poor given the resumption of student loan repayments, lower government benefit payments, and the erosion of pandemic savings.  At the same time, interest rates on consumer loans have risen sharply to very high levels.  Indeed, some FOMC officials have recently said the rise in yields may substitute for further FOMC tightening.  Our baseline remains for the FOMC to keep the Funds rate steady into early 2024.  We consider the FOMC’s significant policy tightening will lead the global economy into recession."
