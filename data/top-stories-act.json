It's just the second loss the organisation has posted since it became a self-funded government business enterprise in 1989. Growth in the parcels business was fairly flat, bringing in $7.3 billion in revenue. However, as expected, the letters business continues to decline, resulting in a loss of $384 million. The average Australian household receives only 2.2 addressed letters each week and that's expected to further halve in the next five years. Group chief executive offer Paul Graham said despite the organisation's efforts, it's not possible to stop the structural shift in the way Australians are using postal services. \"If we do everything in our power to run this business well and we get a favourable regulatory response towards modernisation, I'm confident that Australia Post will return to profit,\" he said.",
