She said a relief centre had been \"very quickly established\" at Sale for both residents of affected communities as well as those who may have been visiting the area. Ms Allan said she would be receiving updates throughout the day. \"The fire season has come and it's come early,\" she said. \" We can see where we're standing here, we've got a couple of days of really wild weather. \"So our emergency services are responding in some really difficult situations at all ends of the state.\" \"I'd ask Victorians to be on the watch for the weather changes, and if you haven't, download the Vic Emergency app.\"",

Hot and windy conditions are causing havoc for firefighters, with out-of-control flames spreading through plantations and state forest. There are three emergency warnings and two watch and act messages current for the region. In Briagolong, residents are being warned that it's too late to leave and that they should take shelter immediately. Briagolong resident Anna Larkin said she was woken at 3:00am by erratic, strong winds. \"I'd like to do a shout out to the Landys, who are farmers here who put their big irrigation arms across the paddocks to protect the town as best as they can,\" Ms Larkin said. \"I think, as usual, the town is coming together and looking after each other .\" Eastern Victoria is bracing for strong winds, rain, and even snow in the coming days.",

CBS's The Late Show With Stephen Colbert, ABC's Jimmy Kimmel Live! and NBC's T he Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon were the first shows to leave the air when the writers strike began on May 2, and now will be among the first to return on Monday night. Comedian John Oliver got his first take on the strike out, exuberantly returning Sunday night to his Last Week Tonight show on HBO and delivering full-throated support for the strike. Oliver cheerily delivered a recap of stories from the last five months before turnings serious, calling the strike \"an immensely difficult time\" for all those in the industry. \"To be clear, this strike happened for good reasons. Our industry has seen its workers severely squeezed in recent years,\" Oliver said. \"So, the writers guild went to strike and thankfully won. But, it took a lot of sacrifices from a lot of people to achieve that.\" \"I am also furious that it took the studios 148 days to achieve a deal they could have offered on day one,\" Oliver said. He added that he hopes the writers contract would give leverage to other entertainment industry guilds – as well as striking auto workers and employees in other industries – to negotiate better deals. Network late-night hosts will have their returns later on Monday. The writers were allowed to return to work last week after the Writers Guild of America reached an agreement on a three-year contract with an alliance of the industry's biggest studios, streaming services and production companies.

This shows what markets are betting in relation to Australian interest rate hikes (and cuts). The likelihood of a rate hike will increase with each succesive month, and is fully priced in by March next year (given inflation is still much too high). However, Australia's economy is expected to slow down considerably in the year ahead, with unemployment likely to rise from 3.7% towards 4.5% next year. In those circumstances, the Reserve Bank will likely encourage consumers to spend money again to stimulate the economy (the complete opposite of what's happening now)! So that's why markets are betting on a rate cut by the end of next year. But market expectations change all the time. So don't be surprised if the shape of this graph totally changes after this afternoon's RBA decision (depending on what new govenor Michele Bullock says in her post-meeting statement). If you want more detail about these rate expectations (and how it might affect property prices), here's my latest finance report:",

This comes after a 1.1% drop overnight (which is pretty steep). Last week, it briefly dropped as low as 63.3 US cents. But as you can see in this chart, the Aussie dollar is practically back to where it was in November last year: And it's mainly because of a surge in the US dollar, on expectations the Federal Reserve may not be done with its interest rate hikes. So that led to more people piling into the \"safe\" greenback, and selling off currencies like the Australian dollar (which tends to go up when investors have more of a \"risk appetite\"). As there's a chance of one more US rate increase by the end of this year, the US Dollar Index also jumped to an 11-month high. It's an index which tracks the US dollar against a basket of currencies including the euro, Swiss franc, Japanese yen, Canadian dollar, British pound, and Swedish krona:",

It looks like markets are increasingly accepting the possibility that interest rates could still rise in the coming months (which is bad for \"riskier\" assets like shares). However, the Reserve Bank is widely expected to keep its cash rate target on hold this afternoon, which will also be the first policy meeting chaired by new governor Michele Bullock. The Australian dollar also suffered heavy losses — it's down 1.1% to 63.6 US cents (near its weakest levels since November last year). That's after the US dollar jumped to an 11-month high. And that's because of a sell-off in the bond market, which has led to the US government's borrowing costs jumping to its highest level since October 2007 (around the time of the Global Financial Crisis). In particular, the US 10-year government yield climbed as high as 4.72%. (That's the return you'll get from lending your money to Uncle Sam for a decade — similar to a term deposit). Spot gold has also dropped 1.1% to $US1,827 an ounce, its lowest level in almost seven months. (Gold tends to do poorly when the US dollar rises). On oil markets, Brent crude futures plunged 1.8% to a three-week low of $US90.56 a barrel, as traders took advantage of a recent surge and cashed out. European stock markets also did poorly, with the Stoxx 600 index down 1%. Meanwhile, Wall Street fared better than everything else, with the Dow Jones down 0.2%, while the S & P 500 was flat, and the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.7%. This promises to be a very interesting day on markets. Stay tuned!",
