It says annual inflation falling to a 12 month low eases pressure on the RBA when it meets next week. “Further cooling of inflation in the June quarter is the latest positive sign that the Reserve Bank’s interest rate rises are having their desired effect on price pressures,” says ACCI chief executive Andrew McKellar. “With falls now coming through, today’s data is encouraging for many small business owners who are now seeing the costs of doing business starting to ease.\" \"Business reiterates its call for the Reserve Bank to hold rates at its August meeting, and take stock of the existing leverage of 12 rate increases since the beginning of the Reserve’s current tightening cycle.” Innes Willox, chief executive of the Australian Industry Group agrees the inflation data is positive. “The lower than expected annual rate of increase in inflation to the end of the March quarter, combined with the recent labour force data, should give some cause for hope that we are on track for a soft landing that retains as many of the recent gains in employment as possible,\" he says. And Mr Willox is warning that wage increases could add to inflation, concerns that have been echoed by the Reserve Bank, but which are dismissed by unions. “There are no guarantees that the landing will be soft and the path remains a narrow one.\" \"It therefore remains critical that continued restraint is exercised by business, governments and employees in price setting and wage negotiations.\"",

But if you dive into the bureau's excel spreadsheets, you find the quarterly picture is quite different. Goods prices (+0.9%) actually increased by more in the June quarter compared to March than services prices (+0.8%). Moreover, the quarterly increase in services prices was the lowest in a year, falling dramatically from a peak of 2.1% in December — when travel providers jacked up prices for summer holidays. The main reason the annual reading is so high is that lower figures from the COVID period have now all dropped out of the annual data, which is dragged up by big services prices rises in the September (+1.6%), December (+2.1%) and March (+1.7%) quarters. The rise of 0.8% in the three months to June is less than half that seen in the previous quarter so, on that basis, services inflation is actually decelerating rather sharply. It must be noted, though, that these quarterly figures are NOT seasonally adjusted, and a quick look back through recent data hints that June is probably the weakest quarter for services price rises on average.",
