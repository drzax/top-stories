              "plaintext": "Workers at Chevron's Wheatstone and Gorgon liquefied natural gas (LNG) plants in Western Australia were set to begin rolling strike action today. They started downing tools at the plants for a few hours at a time last week, but from today are protected to stop work for 24 hours, for two weeks. Workers can determine how long they stop work for during each 24-hour period. Australia is the world's largest exporter of LNG — we mostly supply Asia. In fact, 16 per cent of Japan's energy comes from these projects. Since talks of industrial action by the 500 workers began last month, the price of spot LNG in Europe has been particularly volatile. If the strike action is prolonged and supply is constrained, it could see prices jump even higher. Research group EnergyQuest estimates the strike action could cost Chevron up to $76m in lost revenue a day. The workers are campaigning for better rostering (they currently do two weeks straight of 12-hour days, then fly home for two weeks off), more transparency about job titles and descriptions, less reliance on a labour-hire workforce, and better pay. Chevron and the union, Offshore Alliance, have been unable to reach an agreement and are before the Fair Work Commission. Chevron is pursuing an untested legal strategy to resolve the dispute and has applied to the Fair Work Commission with a hearing for that set down for September 22. The stop work action is likely to continue until then, however both parts have been instructed to keep negotiating.",

The Gorgon and Wheatstone plants in the state's north have the capacity to separate supply and send it south to Perth and customers through the state, both residential and commercial. The workers have given an undertaking that through their protected industrial action they will continue to ensure LNG flows to domestic customers. You might recall, back in 2006 the then WA Premier, Alan Carpenter set up the gas reservation policy with the producers here in the state to ensure they committed 15 per cent of their production was reserved for Western Australian consumption. The WA government has so far stayed clear of weighing in on the Chevron worker dispute, saying it is for the Fair Work Commission to oversee. However, it has stated, should supply become constrained, it has levers it can pull to ensure households are not without energy. This dispute could have a way to run.
