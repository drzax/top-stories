While the two groups are different the two share many similarities especially when it comes to shared hostility towards Israel. \"In fact, the unprecedented operation Hamas conducted on Saturday breaking out of the Gaza, and entering the Israeli settlements around Gaza was straight out of Hezbollah's playbook,\" he said speaking from Beirut. \"A massive rocket barrage, infiltration on mass across the border to cause as much damage and chaos as possible inside Israel. \"Hezbollah have been training since 2007 but in this case it was Hamas which put it into practice with deadly effect.\" But he noted Hezbollah faced constraints with shots still being called by Iran so if the group was told to go to all-out war with Israel they would. But he also said he wasn’t certain Hezbollah would want to face an all-out conflict knowing it would erode is “potent capabilities” further down the road.",

He outlined steps being taken by the US in response to the attack, including: Providing ammunition and interceptors to replenish Israel's Iron Dome missile defence system Sharing intelligence and deploying experts to \"consult with and advise\" their Israeli counterparts on recovering hostages boosting US military assets in the      region \"to strengthen our deterrence\", such as moving a      carrier strike group with thousands of Navy personnel to the eastern      Mediterranean, and bolstering fighter aircraft numbers Mr Biden also said the US Congress, when it resumes this week, would be asked to take \"urgent action\" to fund the national security needs of America's critical partners. (This could be complicated by the fact the House of Representatives still has no speaker). Without naming adversaries like Iran or Hezbollah, he said: \"To any country, any organisation, anyone thinking of taking advantage of this situation, I have one word: don't. \"Our hearts may be broken but our resolve is clear.\" The president confirmed 14 American citizens were killed in the attack. \"We now know that American citizens are among those being held by Hamas,\" he added, but did not say how many.",

Gumatj clan leader and former Australian of the Year Yunupiŋu died earlier this year aged 74, after a lifetime spent trying to better the outcomes of his Yolŋu people in north-east Arnhem Land. Earlier today, Opposition Leader Peter Dutton equated Yunupiŋu's work towards improving his Arnhem Land community with why a Voice to Parliament wasn't needed. \"They've got a logging company, they've got a building company, they've got housing, they've got a functioning society … because of the leadership demonstrated by Yunupiŋu and others around him over the course of a long period, and that's what we want to see replicated elsewhere,\" he said. Mr Dutton's comments in Adelaide did not account for the fact that the East Arnhem local government area (LGA) remains one of the 10 most disadvantaged LGAs in Australia. In reaction, Ms Burney says she was \"shocked at that statement\". \"Yunupiŋu spent his entire life fighting for his people, fighting for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people across this country and also advocating a Voice to Parliament,\" she said. \"Quite frankly, Peter Dutton should apologise for taking the name of Yunupiŋu in vain. \"The idea that there isn't disadvantage in north-east Arnhem Land is patently ridiculous. \"Peter Dutton has no right at all to use the name of Yunupiŋu in that way.\" NOTE: Yunupiŋu's surname and image is used as per the wishes of his family.",

Yesterday, the AEC confirmed 3.3 million Australians had already cast their votes in the referendum. The AEC also detailed some \"fairly bizarre behaviour\" from a small number of voters towards staff at early voting centres. They urged voters to remain civil when heading to the polls. Speaking from Uluru, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese compared misinformation about Voice to \"fake news\" around apology to Stolen Generation.
