              "plaintext": "Car park operator Secure Parking has been accused by the consumer regulator of misleading customers. The ACCC is taking Secure Parking to court for making misleading claims about its Secure a Spot service. It alleges that over a five year period from 2017 to 2022, the company told consumers that they could reserve a parking spot when they chose, but this was not the case. ACCC commissioner Liza Carvers says Secure Parking's car parks were sometimes full before people with a booking arrived, which meant they didn't get a spot. “Some of the consumers who were unable to access the parking space they’d booked complained that they were late to, or entirely missed, appointments, events, and work commitments,” Ms Carver said. “Anyone who has ever driven into a capital city CBD will know that pre-booking a parking space helps puts your mind at ease.\" “We have commenced these court proceedings because we allege Secure Parking was not providing the service it was representing to consumers, and did not reserve a parking space after consumers had pre-booked using the Secure-a-Spot service.” ACCC is seeking penalties, compliance orders and costs against the company. Secure Parking is majority owned by Japanese car park operator Park24, which has 881 car parks and 318,000 car spaces across five countries.",
