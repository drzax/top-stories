I'm sure there's a lot of people wondering this Marcus. As is often the case in economics and finance, it depends who you ask, although no-one would tell you rising rates are a positive for real estate! CoreLogic's head of research Tim Lawless: \"Lower confidence could act as a drag on housing market activity, denting buyer demand at a time when advertised stock levels are rising across most regions. A rebalancing between buyer demand and advertised stock levels is likely to take some heat out of the housing upswing, which has already been losing some momentum, at least at a macro level, since the monthly rate of value growth peaked in May. \"Higher interest rates also imply a further diminishing in borrowing capacity as lenders continue to assess borrowers using a three-percentage point serviceability buffer. \"While growth in housing values is likely to slow further, it's hard to see prices going backwards over the near term. A shortage in housing supply, record low vacancy rates and a lagged flow through to purchasing demand from record levels of overseas migration should help to keep some upwards pressure on home values.\" PropTrack's senior economist Eleanor Creagh with a similar view: \" Record levels of net overseas migration, a challenged rental market, limited housing stock and a slowdown in the completion of new builds are offsetting the impacts of substantial rate rises and the slowing economy, with home prices continuing to lift. \"This additional increase in interest rates may slow the current pace of home price growth but is unlikely to deter these gains, with strong population growth, tight rental markets and a housing shortfall fuelling further price rises.\" But SQM Research managing director Louis Christopher told the AFR earlier this week that there comes a breaking point for the property market, and we may be near it: \"Since the market is finely tuned it might only take one rate rise to create an additional slowdown in housing. The risks rise substantially [of] a period where the market goes into another downturn.\"",

              "plaintext": "France, China and the UAE's ambassadors to the United Nations have amplified demands for a ceasefire in Gaza after an emergency Security Council meeting. French Ambassador Nicolas de Riviere said \"the humanitarian effort which is taking place now is insufficient\". \"They are still fighting. It should stop. We need a truce, a sustainable and durable truce,\" he said. \"It should lead to a ceasefire. But we need a truce first to provide humanitarian access.\" United Arab Emirates Ambassador Lana Nusseibeh echoed the calls for a ceasefire, saying \"there are a number of innocent lives under the rubble today\". \"Without a cessation of hostilities or some kind of humanitarian truce that is immediately implemented, far too many civilians have already lost their lives and far too many more will continue to lose their lives unless that is put into place,\" she said. China's Ambassador Zhang Jun said \"no one is safe\" as aid workers and journalists are killed. \"Palestinian civilians are also deprived of necessities essential to their survival. In the midst of this catastrophic situation, we emphasize the need for the Security Council to act with urgency and adopt a meaningful and actionable resolution,\" he said. \"We call for an urgent humanitarian ceasefire. … This is desperately needed to enable full, rapid, safe and unhindered humanitarian access.\" Paris will host an international humanitarian conference for the civilian population in Gaza later this week as it looks to coordinate international efforts for the Israeli-occupied Palestinian enclave. Diplomats said the conference in Paris on Thursday would also look at setting up a maritime corridor to use sea lanes to ship humanitarian aid into Gaza, but also to see how ships could be used to help the wounded evacuated from Gaza. The United States is pushing hard to arrange pauses in the conflict to allow in aid rather than a full ceasefire, arguing, like Israel, that Hamas militants would just take advantage. \"We're trying to get more trucks through,\" said Robert Wood, deputy US ambassador to the UN. \"This is a difficult situation and we're trying to do the best we can with the situation on the ground, so it's going to take some time. \"We're trying to [prevent] this war from spreading, dealing with the humanitarian situation on the ground … and trying to get the hostages out.\" Reporting with Reuters",

Al-Haq, Al Mezan Centre for Human Rights and the Palestinian Centre for Human Rights said they are seeking \"access to all permits allowing the export of arms and weapons to Israel that have been granted by the Minister for Defence since 7 October\". \"Australia's role in exporting arms material to Israel must be exposed. If Australian-made weapons are being used against Palestinian civilians, our clients and the public deserve to know\", Rawan Arraf, Executive Director at the Australian Centre for International Justice (ACIJ), and solicitor for the Palestinian human rights groups said. \"Countries providing arms to enable Israel's brutal violence against the Palestinian people must be transparent. And Australia must not be complicit in that violence\", she said. \"We know that hundreds of permits have been issued in recent years, but the Australian government keeps the basic details secret: what items are being exported, who is making them, what are they used for?\" It is the first legal challenge attempting to shed light on arms exports permits in Australia, ACIJ said. \"We are seeing the makings of a genocide unfold in front of our eyes\", Issam Younis, Director General Secretary at Al Mezan Centre for Human Rights, said. \"If Australia is selling Israel the means to commit that genocide, it would not only be an unspeakable horror committed against the Palestinian people, it would breach Australia's obligations under international law and its own rules around arms exports.\" The ABC reached out to the Department of Defence for comment but has not received a response at the time of publication.",
