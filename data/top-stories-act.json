A Reuters poll of 26 economists has forecast the unemployment rate to stay at 3.7%. The unemployment rate ticked up slightly to 3.7% in July, when the economy shed 14,600 jobs. In an analyst note, ANZ said it expects the decline in jobs last month to be reversed, with employment up about 30,000. ANZ is forecasting the unemployment rate to tick back down to 3.6%. Out of interest, here's a chart showing what's happening with the unemployment rate over the past five years. See the peak in June 2020 at 7.5% and where it's got to now!",
