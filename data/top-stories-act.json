Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told US President Joe Biden on Wednesday more than 1,400 Israelis were killed in the October 7 attacks by Hamas.

He also said that any attack by Hezbollah on Israel will be \"met with a significant response from our side\". Daily military briefings have been carried out since the beginning of the war.",

The communiqué details 20 resolutions from the meeting, condemning what it calls Israel's \"blatant and unprecedented aggression\" in the occupied territories and the resulting displacement of Palestinians in the Gaza Strip. The OIC calls on member states to \"apply all feasible and effective diplomatic, legal and deterrent measures, to stop the occupying power Israel's crimes against humanity\". The communiqué also calls on \"international actors to engage in sponsoring a serious political path to achieve peace based on ending the illegal Israeli occupation that had begun in 1967 and implementing the two-state solution\". But it does not mention Hamas's deadly cross-border terrorist attack launched on southern Israeli communities on October 7. You can read the communique in full here. The OIC is an intergovernmental committee of 57 states including countries such as Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, Iran, Egypt, Jordan and Lebanon.",
