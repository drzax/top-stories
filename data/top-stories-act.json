When she married Charles in 2005, Clarence House suggested Camilla could be known as the \"Princess Consort\" when her husband was crowned. Then, shortly before the Queen Elizabeth's death in 2022, she said it was her \"sincere wish\" that Camilla be known as \"Queen Consort\" when that time came. There are still some admirers of Princess Diana who find it hard to see Camilla sitting on the throne, let alone being called \"Her Majesty, the Queen.\" The title change will eventually stick, if the palace pushes it. But that doesn't mean everyone will like it."

Almost all of the craftsmanship was sourced from within Australia, with the exception of the two  door handles, made by a New Zealand jeweller, which are individually decorated with 24 diamonds  and 130 sapphires, and the glass in the lamps, made by Edinburgh Crystal. The Australian-made Diamond Jubilee state carriage will be used for the trip to Westminster Abbey, while the much bumpier 18th Century gold state coach will transport them back to Buckingham Palace after the ceremony. The coach is drawn by six Windsor Greys:  Icon, Shadow, Milford Haven, Echo, Knightsbridge and Tyrone."

WA Governor’s wife Darrilyn Dawson welcomed expats and Australians alike to the ballroom, which hosted a crowd of a few dozen people. “It’s been wonderful to have families coming through. Children learning about what it’s all about, the government and the importance of the coronation. It’s obviously a very historic situation here.” Among those attending was the Uckiah family, who lived in the UK for 14 years and now reside in Perth. “It’s a once-in-a-lifetime event … [visiting Government House] is for the kids to understand there is tradition still around, the importance of understanding those structures in the world and the role of the Royal families in peace in the world,” said mother Vidoula. Some members of the public wore crowns and donned royal colours in celebration of the day."

                  "articleBody": "By Europe bureau chief Steve Cannane The palace has promised a \"slimmed down\" coronation. But is that what we will be seeing today? It you compare it to the 1953 coronation there with be about a quarter of the guests, a shorter ceremony and procession, but the costs will remain high. The government has kept the price tag a secret, but some estimates put it at £50-100 million. A lot of Brits are unimpressed that so much public money is being spent in the middle of a cost-of-living crisis. A recent YouGov poll found that 51% of those surveyed did not think the coronation should be paid for with taxpayers' money, 32% though it should, 18% said \"don't know\". Lauren Woodfine, a tattoo artist from Lancashire told me, \"He's just becoming King, just put your hat on\". Michael Glenn, the town crier of Morecambe, has a different view. \"I understand that the cost of living is absolutely dreadful for everybody. But I think what it (the coronation) will bring to the country outweighs the cost.\""

When she married Charles in 2005, Clarence House suggested Camilla could be known as the \"Princess Consort\" when her husband was crowned. Then, shortly before the Queen Elizabeth's death in 2022, she said it was her \"sincere wish\" that Camilla be known as \"Queen Consort\" when that time came. There are still some admirers of Princess Diana who find it hard to see Camilla sitting on the throne, let alone being called \"Her Majesty, the Queen.\" The title change will eventually stick, if the palace pushes it. But that doesn't mean everyone will like it.",

Almost all of the craftsmanship was sourced from within Australia, with the exception of the two  door handles, made by a New Zealand jeweller, which are individually decorated with 24 diamonds  and 130 sapphires, and the glass in the lamps, made by Edinburgh Crystal. The Australian-made Diamond Jubilee state carriage will be used for the trip to Westminster Abbey, while the much bumpier 18th Century gold state coach will transport them back to Buckingham Palace after the ceremony.

WA Governor’s wife Darrilyn Dawson welcomed expats and Australians alike to the ballroom, which hosted a crowd of a few dozen people. “It’s been wonderful to have families coming through. Children learning about what it’s all about, the government and the importance of the coronation. It’s obviously a very historic situation here.” Among those attending was the Uckiah family, who lived in the UK for 14 years and now reside in Perth. “It’s a once-in-a-lifetime event … [visiting Government House] is for the kids to understand there is tradition still around, the importance of understanding those structures in the world and the role of the Royal families in peace in the world,” said mother Vidoula. Some members of the public wore crowns and donned royal colours in celebration of the day.",

It you compare it to the 1953 coronation there with be about a quarter of the guests, a shorter ceremony and procession, but the costs will remain high. The government has kept the price tag a secret, but some estimates put it at £50-100 million. A lot of Brits are unimpressed that so much public money is being spent in the middle of a cost-of-living crisis. A recent YouGov poll found that 51% of those surveyed did not think the coronation should be paid for with taxpayers' money, 32% though it should, 18% said \"don't know\". Lauren Woodfine, a tattoo artist from Lancashire told me, \"He's just becoming King, just put your hat on\". Michael Glenn, the town crier of Morecambe, has a different view. \"I understand that the cost of living is absolutely dreadful for everybody. But I think what it (the coronation) will bring to the country outweighs the cost.\"",
