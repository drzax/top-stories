PwC has released its conclusions into its own investigation into the tax leak scandal, and as a result, eight partners \"have exited or are in the process of being removed\". Those include Peter Konidaris, Eddy Moussa, Richard Gregg, Pete Calleja, Sean Gregory, Peter van Dongen, Wayne Plummer and Tom Seymour — PwC Australia's CEO, who was replaced by acting CEO Kristin Stubbins in the wake of the scandal. Their exits are in addition to the former four partners, who have previously been named as Michael Bersten, Peter Collins, Neil Fuller, and Paul McNab. PwC says the investigation found a number of specific examples where professional standards were breached, regarding the misuse of confidential information or other matters reviewed by the ATO. \"Furthermore, the investigation identified a failure of leadership and governance to adequately address the matters, either at the time or whilst the matters were under investigation by the TPB or ATO. This enabled poor behaviours to persist with no accountability. These behaviours are not, and never have been, acceptable under PwC’s standards,\" the firm said in a statement.",
