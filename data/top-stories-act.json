Security camera footage released by police, from the southern town of Berat, shows two men starting a fire. They have also been identified and arrested. \"The fire has reached a massive area of pine trees near the town of Lac and this is one of the worst wildfires this year,\" Interior Minister Taulant Balla said on social media. Local media showed video of an army helicopter pouring water in the area as a flames could be seen close to houses. Defence Minister Niko Peleshi says 50 soldiers were deployed but stopping the fire remained a challenge due to difficult terrain. In July alone, Albania identified and charged 14 people with starting wildfires, which is punishable with up to 15 years in jail. Wildfires are also raging in Greece, Spain, Italy and Portugal, as the region suffers hot, dry and windy conditions that scientists have linked to climate change.",

Investors are cautious on Wall Street ahead of a major speech by US central bank chairman Jerome Powell in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, on Friday. They are worried that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates again because of the resilient US economy. Benchmark Treasury yields climbed to near a 16-year high on the concerns. Nvidia shares reached a record high of $US481.87 ahead of the chipmaker's profit results. The S & P 500 fell 0.3 per cent, but the Nasdaq edged higher. Financial stocks fell after credit ratings agency S & P downgraded the credit ratings of multiple US regional banks. Coming up today, Woolworths will release its annual profit, which will give us more insight into the impact of the high cost of living on consumers. Other profit results out today include Domino's Pizza and oil and gas producer Santos. Join us for all your markets news.",
