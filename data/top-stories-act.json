Stanley Turvey, who has distinctive tattoos on his face and body, is believed to be armed and police say he should not be approached. A warrant for his arrest was issued this morning. Police say Turvey was armed when Shepparton detectives arrived at a Katandra West property to arrest him around midday. Turvey was challenged by police to drop the weapon when he fired a shot into the air before fleeing the scene in a vehicle. He then stopped at a house in Youanmite and forced a man to drive him across the border to Finley in New South Wales. Turvey, who police say let the driver go in Finley and did not harm him, has been charged with kidnap over the incident. You can read the full story below:",

Jens Haaning, 58, was commissioned by the Kunsten Museum to reproduce two works using the cash — Danish kroner and euros — to represent the annual salary in Denmark and Austria. A Copenhagen court has ordered Haaning to refund the museum 492,549 kroner ($AU70,480), which is equivalent to the sum the museum had given him minus the artist's fee and the mounting cost. Museum director Lasse Andersson previously told AFP that he laughed out loud when he first saw the two blank canvasses in 2021, and decided to show the works anyway. He said they have a \"humouristic approach\" and were \"a reflection on how we value work\". But he said the museum would take Haaning to court if he didn't pay back the money, which he refused to do. Interviewed on TV2 Nord television, Haaning said the museum had made \"much, much more\" money than what it invested thanks to the publicity surrounding the affair.",

Around Australia's coastline there are around 1 million tonnes of pipelines, fixed rigs, and floating vessels. Much of the infrastructure is due to be decommissioned and operators are required to clean up the sites. Back in August 2009, the Montara wellhead platform owned by PTTP Australasia in the Timor Sea suffered a well head blowout that caused an uncontrolled leak of oil and gas. The spill was not contained until November2009, the worst oil spill in Australia's history. So could it happen again? As my colleague Linton Besser reports, while oil and gas firms are legally required to clean up their sites, some don't want to pay the cost, which is estimated at more than $60 billion.",
