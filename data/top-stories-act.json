A spokesperson says they became aware of the hack — where an unauthorised third party accessed some of the company's data — earlier this month. Pizza Hut says it believes the data stolen includes customers' names, delivery address and instructions, email address and contact number — but no payment details. Stan Gallo is a forensic services partner at consultancy firm BDO, and says it's likely people will see more text messages and emails from scammers. \"And that won't necessarily come from someone pretending to be Pizza Hut,\" he says. \"If they've got your contact details I might get a message that purports to come from you for example. So, those sorts of thing will rise and people need to be cautious of those.\" Mr Gallo suggests setting up a separate email address as one way to thwart scammers. \"You can redirect some of that unwanted traffic, and one that you wouldn't use elsewhere. And I'd tie that to the old addage of not using the same password,\" he says. \"In this case, I don't believe passwords were affected. But you could also tie that with using a card for those purchases with a very low balance.\"",
