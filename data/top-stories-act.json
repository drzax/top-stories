In March, the former ATO employee lost his bid to be declared immune from prosecution on 24 offences stemming from his decision to go public on what he claims were unethical tactics used by his former employer to collect debts. His plight has highlighted the stark difference in justice meted out to those acting alone as opposed to those protected by the veil of the corporate world. Ironically, Mr Boyle's Federal Court decision came just weeks after Peter Collins, the former senior tax partner at accounting giant PwC, was barred from practising by the Tax Practitioners Board. His misdeed? It was discovered that in 2014, Mr Collins had shared confidential tax information with other partners and staff about a federal government initiative to clamp down on multinational tax avoidance. Ever since the Tax Practitioners Board decision in January, the firm has been desperately trying to contain the damage, hosing down concerns from within and outside the firm. But to no avail. In the past fortnight, the firm has been plunged into a crisis that threatens its very future in Australia. For more on this, here's the latest analysis from business editor Ian Verrender :",
