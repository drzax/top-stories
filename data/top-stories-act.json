I think we do need to be more creative in how we combat inflation. A couple of months ago, I wrote about an idea that John Maynard Keynes came up with to control inflation during WWII. Friedrich Hayek, the Austrian economist who really detested Keynes's influence on policymakers, even had to admit the idea was \"ingenious.\" Now, the possibility of using an idea like this would depend on the nature of the problem that's causing the inflation, and the nature of the inflation itself, but I think it helps to open one's mind to all possibilities - so we can see the world with fresh eyes sometimes.

Interest rate rises won't occur monthly and indefinitely. We can blame economists for lots of things, but they did learn a lot from the misjudgements they made in the late 1980s and early 1990s when driving the overnight cash rate above 18%, and keeping rates too high for too long. That's not to say these rate rises won't drive unemployment higher. The RBA itself is expecting the unemployment rate to rise from 3.7% (currently) to 4.5% by mid-2025.

Unit labour costs are also rising briskly, with productivity growth remaining subdued.\" In particular, Mr Lowe drew attention to last week's slightly bigger than expected rise in minimum and award wages, which was the highest in decades. \"Wages growth has picked up in response to the tight labour market and high inflation,\" he observed. \"Growth in public sector wages is expected to pick up further and the annual increase in award wages was higher than it was last year. \"At the aggregate level, wages growth is still consistent with the inflation target, provided that productivity growth picks up.\" In contrast — Treasurer Jim Chalmers has pointed out that the rate rise is because of inflation, not the higher wages announced by the Fair Work Commission last week.
