I know its only one part of the solution but how do we consumers find out about buying goods using less, or no plastic, and/or products using alternatives to the 'bad' non-degradable plastics? Is there a good website or other place to go for the info? - Edwin Carr. Thanks Edwin for that question. I've passed it on to Craig, here's his take: Hi Edwin, you should find some tips on the Plastic Free July website. You can search for bulk food stores in your area, where you bring your own bottles and containers and fill them up with foods and other products. There are also a number of new companies that seek to reduce plastic by selling you refillable containers and getting you to mail back the packaging used to refill them.",

Professor Veena Sahajwalla has this to say: There is great technology and science being developed right here in Australia that we can take advantage of to find fit-for-purpose solutions, especially with the unique challenges that Australia’s landscape and markets present. The Australian Research Council is supporting cutting-edge science, bringing together industry and researchers, to address complex waste challenges. I am privileged to be directing one of these research centres, SMaRT Centre, in creating microfactories and the science of microrecycling to tackle some our most challenging waste issues.",

Energy stocks are on the up, with Santos gaining 1.1 per cent so far. Despite the good performances, the gains across the broader index are being capped by falls in the financials sector — shares in Westpac have dropped 1.4 per cent.
