Mr Stevens praised the federal government for using the windfall from higher revenue to put the budget temporarily back into the black. \"What the economy did for the budget was a large control gain in the bottom line because of strong growth, high commodity prices, and so on,\" Mr Stevens said. \"I think it's to the government's credit that they've allowed most of that to flow through to the bottom line.\" \"That's the right thing to do.\" The federal opposition and some economists argue that the billions of dollars in spending could fuel inflation and make the Reserve Bank's job harder. But Mr Stevens doesn't think there will be much impact. \"I would assess....that the budget is slightly expansionary,\" he said. \"Its implication for interest rates and inflation, I think, to be honest, not that much really.\" \"The budget is what it is.\" \"There's a dozen other things also affecting the economy, this is just one of them.\"",

Inflation risks from weak productivity growth, persistently high inflation in the services sector and faster-than-forecast rent increases were the reasons behind the RBA's latest rate hike, according to the minutes of its May board meeting (released today). The board members also considered a pause, but ultimately decided the high inflation risks warranted a 0.25 percentage rate point increase (after holding rates steady in April). \"In weighing up the two options, members recognised that the arguments were finely balanced but judged it appropriate to increase interest rates at his meeting,\" the RBA minutes noted. \"Members also agreed that further increases in interest rates may still be required, but that this would depend on how the economy and inflation evolve.\" Annual inflation is not expected to fall to 3% (the top of the RBA's target range) until mid-2025, leaving little room for upside risks, the May minutes said. The RBA board members also noted strong employment data and high services price inflation in March (along with the weaker Australian dollar and rising house prices) may have been in part caused by the central bank's decision to pause rates in April. Governor Philip Lowe has warned that the RBA cannot take too long to being inflation to heel. Rates have already risen by a whopping 375 basis points since last May to an 11-year high of 3.85%. Markets have priced an 85% chance of a pause in June, while seeing a higher risk of a hike in August or September.",
