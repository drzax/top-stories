The odds of a rate hike by the Reserve Bank next week have dropped with the market betting on a 29 per cent chance of a 0.25 per cent rise, and a 71 per cent chance that rates will stay on hold. The Australian dollar slumped and the Australian market increased. The dollar dropped nearly 1 per cent to 67.29 US cents because investors think the pull back in inflation buys the Reserve Bank more time to consider the data, so it may pause rate hikes again next week. Rate rises boost currencies because they increase the cost of money. The ASX 200 extended its gains by 0.8 per cent with investors also betting on a pause, although real estate firms are lower. Consumer staples did well on the news, but its banks and big miners that are driving the market today. Banks also extended their gains after the numbers came out. ANZ is up 1.5 per cent, while Westpac has put on 1.6 per cent. Even though banks make money from interest rate rises, higher borrowing costs also means a likely rise in loan defaults.",

It's the second consecutive quarter of lower annual inflation. This is known as \" disinflation\". Market economists were expecting the headline rate of annual inflation to fall to 6.2 per cent, so it's lower than they were anticipating. And what about underlying inflation? The Reserve Bank is particularly interested in underlying inflation, because that shows us what's happening to inflation when volatile price movements are stripped out of the headline figure. The ABS refers to underlying inflation as \"trimmed mean\" inflation. And it has fallen to 5.9 per cent in the June quarter, down from 6.6 per cent in the March quarter, and the peak in December 2022 of 6.9 per cent. When the RBA talks about wanting to get inflation back down into its 2-3% target range, it's talking about underlying/trimmed mean inflation. So it's heading back towards target.",
