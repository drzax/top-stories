Teams from across Europe had rushed to Morca cave in southern Türkiye’s Taurus Mountains to aid Mark Dickey, a 40-year-old experienced caver who became seriously ill on September 2 with stomach bleeding. He was on an expedition to map the cave, which is the country’s third deepest. Dickey was too frail to climb out himself, so rescuers carried him with the help of a stretcher, making frequent stops at temporary camps set up along the way. “Mark Dickey is out of the Morca cave. He is fine and is being tended to by emergency medical worker in the encampment above,” said a statement by the speleological federation on Monday. \"Thus, the cave rescue part of the operation has ended successfully.

Reuters reports it's because investment bank Morgan Stanley estimates that Tesla's Dojo supercomputer could power a nearly $US600 billion surge in the value of the electric carmaker. Morgan Stanley thinks Dojo could speed up Tesla's move into robotaxis and software services. Tesla is producing a supercomputer to train artificial intelligence models for self driving cars and plans to spend more than $US1 billion on Dojo over the coming year. Morgan Stanley upgraded Tesla stock to \"overweight\" from \"equal weight\" and is betting on a more than 70 per cent rise in Tesla's share price to $US400 over the next 12 to 18 months. That would mean a $US1.4 trillion market value for Tesla. Its current market value is around $US790 billion and its shares closed up 10 per cent to $US273.58 overnight. Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas: \"If Dojo can help make cars 'see' and 'react', what other markets could open up?\" \"Think of any device at the edge with a camera that makes real-time decisions based on its visual field.\"",

US stocks ended higher as investors as awaited the consumer inflation data for August, which will give clues on where the Federal Reserve is going with interest rates. The Fed is expected to keep rates on hold next week. Meanwhile, IG Markets says doubts have intensified over whether or not the European Central Bank will raise interest rates for the 10th consecutive time this week. Tesla surged 10 per cent after investment bank Morgan Stanley said its Dojo supercomputer could speed up its foray into robotaxis and software services. Morgan Stanley says that could boost Tesla's value by around $US600 billion. The European Commission downgraded growth forecasts for the European Union for 2023 from 1 per cent to 0.8 per cent, and for 2024 from 1.6 per cent to 1.4 per cent. Coming up today we will get the latest reading on consumer confidence with the Westpac-Melbourne Institute Consumer Sentiment survey. And business confidence with the National Australia Bank business survey. That's ahead of the latest unemployment figures which will be out on Thursday. Come along for the ride.",
