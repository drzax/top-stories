In a later series of questions, Deputy Opposition Leader Sussan Ley described the referendum as \"divisive and incompetently managed\", asking why Mr Albanese he had focused on \"inner-city elites\": \"Why did he refuse to hold a constitutional convention? Why didn't he make the effort to achieve bipartisanship? Why did he waste $450 million of taxpayers' money? Why did he proceed when it was clear his vanity project was going so disastrously wrong?\" In response, Mr Albanese said: \"Let's be very clear here about what occurred. There was a constitutional convention. There was one established under the former government in 2017. After a process that the former government established under Tony Abbott when he established a process, a working group, who are charged with coming back to the Australian people about what form constitutional recognition should take. \"That was after John Howard, of course, and every other leader since promised to promote constitutional recognition. \"After a process in 2017, First Nations people through the Uluru Statement from the Heart, those eloquent 440 words, issued an invitation to Australians to walk with them on the form of recognition they sought. That was recognition through a Voice. There were then processes established, including under the former government, The Calma Langton Report and other processes, the joint committee chaired by Patrick Dodson and Julian Leeser, to progress this issue. \"I said before the election on a range of occasions, as did both leaders, Scott Morrison and Bill Shorten prior to 2019, that there would be an advance on these issues. I was at Garma when the minister for Indigenous affairs, Ken Wyatt, said there would be a referendum held. I was there in 2019. \"What occurred was that I fulfilled that commitment that I made. It was not out of convenience, it was out of conviction. I believe that when you make a commitment, including a commitment to Indigenous people, that it should be fulfilled. \"And, I make this point — across remote areas dominated by Indigenous communities, Yes recorded massive support.\"",

              "plaintext": "There has been widespread in-principle support for regulating cryptocurrency exchanges and digital asset platforms under the same rules that apply to other financial institutions. The Treasurer Jim Chalmers and Assistant Treasurer Stephen Jones today released a proposal paper that, among other things, recommends requiring crypto platform operators to hold an Australian Financial Services Licence. The government is also planning to implement some additional specific minimum standards for the sector around holding tokens, custody software and transactions. The government says the proposals are broadly in line with regulation in other countries and will give crypto investors better protections against financial loss resulting from the collapse of an exchange. BTC Markets CEO Caroline Bower said her company had already been positioning itself for such regulation. \"Digital assets are so clearly the future of financial services. It is imperative the country keeps pace with our international peers, with a robust regulatory framework. \"BTC Markets has long agitated for appropriate, proportional regulation of the crypto industry in Australia.\" The banking sector has also welcomed the move via its lobby group, the Australian Banking Association, whose CEO Anna Bligh said it was a welcome step in the fight against scams. \"Almost half of scammed funds are currently being channelled into crypto, the getaway vehicle of choice for scammers,\" she said. \"Once the stolen money reaches a crypto exchange, it is virtually impossible to recover. \"This means no matter what financial services door a customer walks through, customers will be protected by the same regulatory standards.\" The government is inviting feedback on the proposal paper until December 1, with further consultation next year on the resulting draft legislation.",

Abermarle says it decided to dump the bid because there were \"growing complexities\" around the transaction. The US miner's decision comes days after Hancock Prospecting, the iron ore miner controlled by Gina Rinehart, increased its stake in Liontown to 19.9% —which would have likely been enough to block Abermarle's takeover bid of $3 a share. \"Our engagement with the Liontown team has been meaningful and productive. We appreciate the level of cooperation we have received, and we thank the entire team for their efforts,\" Albemarle CEO Kent Masters said in a statement. \"That said, moving forward with the acquisition, at this time, is not in Albemarle's best interests .\" Hancock Prospecting has not commented on the development. Liontown Resources entered a trading halt earlier this morning, shortly after making the announcement to the market. The company says the halt will remain in place until Liontown makes an announcement regarding the funding of its Kathleen Valley project, or Wednesday October 18 — whichever comes first.

Next up is Nate Caddy, perhaps the most eye-catching of this year's crop. With his glowing blonde hair and hulking frame, Caddy was impossible to miss on the field as he got around with Vic Metro and the Northern Knights. His footy backed up the attention though, as he starred as a mobile forward who could push up the ground and even have stints in midfield. Caddy's athletic gifts are obvious — his frame is massive, but he covers the ground exceptionally well — and his skills improved as the year progressed. Caddy has worked hard on his goalkicking in particular, and with his impressive tank and work rate is able to get up the field to make his presence felt while still rolling back to hit the scoreboard. He's still a bit untidy, a bit of a bull at a gate sometimes, but clubs will love his infectious energy. Expect Caddy to be a top 10 pick, and expect him to see AFL footy early in 2023 as his body is as ready as a first-year player's can get.",
