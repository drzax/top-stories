The protection of civilian lives must come first, as the parliament said in its resolution that we carried on Monday, and respect for international humanitarian law is paramount. \"We condemn any indiscriminate attacks and targeting of civilian infrastructure, including hospitals and Australia joins with others in calling for international law to always be upheld.\"",

But it was a few big rises that helped the broader market to a solid 0.3% rise. Whitehaven Coal is buying steelmaking coal mines off BHP and Mitsubishi, and the market clearly thinks it's getting a great deal, with its share price up 11.5% to $7.57. The market also became hopeful that Aussie winemakers like Treasury might again start getting a fair deal from the Chinese government, with that country's ambassador this afternoon hinting that punitive tariffs could soon be unwound. Treasury was up 5% to $12.23 as a result. The other big winners were: Genesis Minerals +7.4% to $1.535 Weebit Nano +6.9% to $3.11 Capricorn Metals +6% to $4.75 Neuren Pharmaceuticals +5.3% to $11.57 The big loser of the day was debt collecting giant Credit Corp, after it revealed increasing difficulties recouping moneys owed in the US, where it has a large business. Its shares were crunched 30.5% to $11.97. The other major losers were: Bapcor -7.6% to $5.46 Hub24 -5.4% to $31.77 Cromwell Property Group -3.8% to $0.38 Charter Hall Social Infrastructure REIT -2.9% to $2.64",

As reported in the AFR, China's ambassador to Australia has said that the country's punitive tariffs on Australian wine could be removed in coming weeks or months as the two governments continue thawing relations. The ambassador was speaking at an Australia-China Business Council event at Parliament House in Canberra. Treasury Wine Estates was a major exporter to China before those tariffs all but totally dried up that market overnight. Treasury shares closed up 5% at $12.23 on the ambassador's afternoon comments. Kathleen Ferguson had a great story on AM yesterday about how badly this has affected parts of the Australian wine industry, with nearly 860 Olympic-sized swimming pools of wine sitting in tanks, barrels and bottles around the country.",

Market economists had generally expected 1% and 4.4% growth respectively. But, as is often the case with official Chinese government data, many in the market are somewhat sceptical. \"Our in-house China Activity Proxy (CAP) paints quite a different picture,\" writes Capital Economics' head of China economics Julian Evans-Pritchard. \"It suggests that growth slowed from 1.3% q/q in Q2 to 1.0% in Q3 and that cumulative growth since the end of 2019 is almost 6%-pts lower than official figures claim. \"But even the CAP suggests things are starting to improve again. In monthly terms, it shows that output bottomed out in June, with the economy since regaining some momentum. That's a trend that appears to have continued in September, judging by the latest activity data.\" And, while things may be substantially weaker than the official figures suggest, Mr Evans-Pritchard says the economic turnaround is real. \" The economy has clearly turned a corner thanks to policy support. And we anticipate a further recovery over the coming quarters.\" ANZ's China economists Raymond Yeung and Zhaopeng Xing say this recovery may see a wind-back in economic support from the central government and policymakers. \"Government officials will be feeling confident about achieving a growth target of 5%,\" they note. \"They could therefore scale down the intensity of stimulus measures. They do see the issue of household and private sector confidence, so will stick to a more targeted approach in formulating policy, going forward. \"Despite the data improvement, the output gap remains negative as indicated by weak domestic prices (CPI 0.0%). The weakness in investment suggests the real interest rate is too high. We expect the People's Bank of China to reduce the 1y Loan Prime Rate by 5bp on Friday. \" They have put together a handy ready reckoner for recent Chinese economic data, which shows it's been generally positive.",
