In the minutes after the employment data was released, the Australian dollar hit a low of 63.65 US cents, down by 0.9%. It also took its trans-Tasman cousin along for the ride too, dragging the New Zealand dollar down by 0.5% to 59.03 US cents. It's the lowest level the Aussie and NZ dollar have hit since November. \"Cracks are finally appearing in the employment data, and that should clear up any doubt over whether the (Reserve Bank of Australia) is done hiking ,\" said Matt Simpson, senior market analyst at City Index. \" They're done at 4.1% as far as I'm concerned now, with persistently weak data from China and easing from the (People's Bank of China) adding to the case of a peak rate.\"",
