Capital Economics Australian and New Zealand economist Abhijit Surya says it was a surprise to no one. \"The RBNZ's decision to leave its official cash rate on hold at 5.5 per cent was widely expected. \"The minutes of the July meeting reinforce our view that the bank's tightening cycle is over.\" Surya says the central bank noted higher interest rates were \"constraining domestic spending as expected\" in a nod to the recession caused by the steep hike in official rates. And he suggest that rate cuts could be on the cards next year. \"Although the bank implied that rate cuts would be unlikely before the second half of 2024, we think the combination of a deepening recession and easing price pressures will pave the way for an easing cycle as early as Q1 2024 (the first quarter of next year). New Zealand lifted interest rates by 5.25 per cent over 20 months in the most aggressive tightening since the official cash rate was introduced in 1990.",
