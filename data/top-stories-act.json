The trial began inside a maximum security penal colony in Melekhovo, where 47-year-old Navalny is serving a nine-year sentence for fraud and contempt of court — charges which he says are politically motivated. Soon after it started, the judge closed the trial despite Navalny's demand to keep it open. Navalny says his new extremism charges, which he rejects as \"absurd,\" could keep him in prison for another 30 years. He says an investigator told him that he would also face a separate military trial on terrorism charges that potentially carry a life sentence. \"We must do what they fear — tell the truth, spread the truth,\" Navalny says. \"This is the most powerful weapon against this regime of liars, thieves and hypocrites. Everyone has this weapon. So make use of it.\"",

Welll, those temples, which date back as far as the 3rd century BC, can now be visited by tourists. For decades, the curious had to gaze down from the bustling sidewalks rimming Largo Argentina (Argentina Square) to admire the temples below. That's because, over the centuries, the city had been built up, layer by layer, to levels several meters above the area where Caesar masterminded his political strategies and was later fatally stabbed in 44 BC. Behind two of the temples is a foundation and part of a wall that archaeologists believe were part of Pompey's Curia, a large rectangular-shaped hall that temporarily hosted the Roman Senate when Caesar was murdered. I do hope the cats can still hang out there though.",
