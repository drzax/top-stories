She says the quarterly 1.2% inflation increase means we're in a \"grey zone\" but it isn't enough to say for certain whether it will prompt the RBA to lift the cash rate on November 7. \"A key number I was looking for was that underlying measure of inflation, and coming out of 1.2% over the quarter, I think that there is a complete 50-50 coin toss as to whether the RBA will hike rates in November because it is a bit of a grey area,\" she said. \"I was thinking if the number was closer to 1.3% then the Reserve Bank would probably hike, but 1.2% probably does still mean that inflation projections over the next two years are still intact. \"They are forecasting inflation to only come down from its target band of 2.5% by 2025, so I think a 1.2% underlying inflation figure still does keep that in line, but it probably will concern them because we have seen that underlying inflation has ticked up from last quarter at 0.9% and it has now got up to 1.2%. \"When I look at the components in today's data there are still signs that in services you are still seeing sticky prices, which is what [RBA] governor Bullock has been talking about the past few times she has spoken in recent weeks.\"",
