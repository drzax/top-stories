Keanu Vicente lives in Israel but says he fled from Tel Aviv to Nazareth in the north of the country to avoid the shelling. \"I was on the phone to the emergency Australian consular assistance today just asking them for any updates, at the time I called they told me they didn't have any plans for repatriation flights,\" he says. \"The last 12 hours today, it's just been very tense with a lot of bad news pouring in from down south. \"A lot of our friends and family lost a lot of people.\" He says he hid in bomb shelters in Tel Aviv on the day bombing broke out. \"We woke up to the bombs and were hiding in the bomb shelters all day there,\" Mr Vicente says. He says many friends have been called into Israel's reserve forces in response to the conflict. \"So that brings about a new sense of worry,\" he says.",

He said the decision to tell members of the Jewish community not to go to the Opera House was an \"operational policing decision for the safety and security of the city\". He said there were discussions happening between the government, police and the Jewish community. \"The situation where they're told not to come into the city, despite it being an operational decision in a tight time frame, went ahead last night but that's intolerable for the future, and I know New South Wales police are talking with that community today and changes will be made.\" Watch the full interview below.",

It follows fellow sports star, Panthers NRL Premiership hero Nathan Cleary also announcing his support for a First Nations Voice to Parliament. A week after winning the AFL Premiership, Darcy Moore told RN Breakfast host Patricia Karvelas that despite what some people thought, sport and politics could mix. \"I'll be voting yes. To me, I feel like it's an intuitive next step and seems to be an important and practical way to help Indigenous Australians,\" he said. \"There are certainly people out there that want you to shut up and play sport, but we've seen all around the country, like with Nathan Cleary, athletes are human beings and citizens of the country too, so they can exercise their right and say what they want to say and they can do it in a really healthy way. \"The argument around division … to my mind there is already advisory bodies for Indigenous Australians that have come and gone as governments have changed. The mechanism has kind of already existed anyway, so by making it sort of permanent in the constitution, it's just locking it in. So in that way it's not anything new.\" Listen to the full interview below.",

Because it thinks the public benefits of the takeover will more than make up for it. ACCC chair Gina Cass-Gottlieb says the acquisition will likely result in \"an accelerated roll-out of renewable energy generation,\" and lead to \"a more rapid reduction in Australia’s greenhouse gas emissions\". “The Brookfield Global Transition Fund has been specifically established to focus on the transition to renewable energy,\" she said. \"Its decision to buy Origin, Australia's fourth-largest emitter of greenhouse gases, is driven by a strong imperative and commercial incentive to lower emissions quickly. \"In this case, we determined that the likely gains for Australia's renewable energy transition amount to a public benefit sufficient to outweigh the likely public detriments. \"We drew extensively on our engagement with industry participants to weigh these public benefits and detriments,\" she said. She says the accelerated build-out of Origin's renewable energy generation would be a material benefit to the Australian public, because it would replace some fossil fuel generation earlier than would occur without the proposed acquisition. \"The ACCC considers that a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions is a public benefit of considerable weight,\" she said. However, the ACCC also says there are several reasons why the benefits to the community may not be as large as suggested by the $20 billion to $30 billion build-out plan proposed by Brookfield. \"These factors include constraints within the electricity transmission network, particularly in the short-term, which may delay Brookfield's ability to build renewable energy generation at the speed claimed,\" she said. \"We also recognise that some of Brookfield's proposed renewable investments would be likely to be made by others if the acquisition does not eventuate.\"",

And it's doing so despite admitting that it's not satisfied that the acquisition would not be likely to substantially lessen competition. The proposed acquisition comprises two interdependent transactions. The transactions will result in a consortium led by the Brookfield Global Transition Fund owning Origin’s energy markets business, including Origin’s electricity generation and electricity and gas retail businesses. MidOcean will own Origin’s upstream gas interests. Under the Competition and Consumer Act, the ACCC must not grant authorisation unless it is satisfied in all the circumstances that the proposed acquisition would not be likely to substantially lessen competition, or that the likely public benefits would outweigh the likely public detriments. But here's what the ACCC has to say about that. \"On the first limb of the test, we are not satisfied that the proposed acquisition would not be likely to substantially lessen competition,\" ACCC chair Gina Cass-Gottlieb said. \"However, after a detailed review, we are satisfied that the proposed acquisition is likely to result in public benefits that would outweigh the likely public detriments. \"We found that the public benefits and public detriments in this matter were finely balanced. Likely detriments, particularly anti-competitive effects from vertical integration, had to be weighed against likely benefits to Australia's renewable energy transition. We considered undertakings offered by Brookfield, AusNet and MidOcean in this weighing process.\"",
