Workers are into their second week of industrial action, including 24 hour stoppages. Both parties have been fronting the Fair Work Commission to try to strike a deal. But talks yesterday ended without a deal, with a Chevron spokesperson saying it's now up to a workplace tribunal to map a way forward. Chevron Australia said despite \"meaningful negotiations\" this week, unions at the Wheatstone and Gorgon facilities, which export about 7 per cent of global LNG, continued to ask for terms well above industry standards. \"The ongoing lack of agreement reinforces our view that there is no reasonable prospect of agreement between the parties, \" the Chevron spokesperson said. A spokesman from the offshore Alliance - the union representing the Chevron workers sent through this statement. \"The negotiations before the Commissioner were useful and resulted in some concessions on both sides. However, the Offshore Alliance and its members want to secure an enterprise agreement that locks in industry standard terms and conditions and the offer made by Chevron at the conclusion of the negotiations failed to meet that standard. \"Offshore Alliance members remain open to compromise, but Chevron must table an offer that doesn't have Chevron providing lesser terms and conditions of employment to its employees when compared to other employers in the sector.\" The Fair Work Commission, will meet on Friday to review the dispute.",
