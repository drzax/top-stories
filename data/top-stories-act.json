              "plaintext": "US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen on Thursday urged Congress to raise the $US31.4 trillion federal debt limit and avert an unprecedented default that would trigger a global economic downturn and risk undermining US global economic leadership. Ms Yellen issued the latest in a series of increasingly stark warnings in remarks prepared for a press conference ahead of a meeting in Japan with her counterparts from the Group of Seven (G7) rich nations, as well as India, Indonesia and Brazil. \"A default would threaten the gains that we've worked so hard to make over the past few years in our pandemic recovery. And it would spark a global downturn that would set us back much further,\" she said. \"It would also risk undermining U.S. global economic leadership and raise questions about our ability to defend our national security interests.\" U. President Joe Biden said failure by Congress to act before Treasury runs out of money to pay the government's bills - something that could happen as early as June 1 - risked throwing the US economy into a recession. Ms Yellen said Republican brinkmanship on the issue amounted to a \"crisis of our own making\" and that just the threat of a default could lead to a downgrade of the US government's credit rating, as occurred during a debt ceiling fight in 2011. It could drive interest rates higher on mortgages, auto payments and credit cards, Ms Yellen said, noting that rates were already spiking on debt due around June 1. Unlike most developed countries, the US sets a ceiling on how much it can borrow. Because the government spends more than it takes in, lawmakers must periodically raise that cap. Ms Yellen said she would also work with her G7 counterparts to build greater economic resilience in the longer term by boosting domestic production of critical goods and helping developing countries expand their stake in global supply chains. - with Reuters",
