The other sector which saw a fall in turnover was food and accommodation services. We've heard a lot about post-COVID 'revenge spending', with people still forking out on dining and travel even as cost of living pressures mount, after several lockdown-disrupted years. However, accommodation and food services saw an 0.3 per cent decline in turnover in the month, after rising for three months. The biggest increase was in electricity, gas, water and waste services, after turnover in that industry fell in April.",
