The 73-year-old said when he entered the polling station, official workers told him he wasn't allowed to vote while wearing a Yes shirt, but did not give him an explanation as to why. He was told to go home and change clothes if he wanted to cast his ballot. \"We were just going around peacefully, doing our business to vote,\" Mr Brown said. In a statement, a spokesperson encouraged voters to not wear campaign clothing, as the law states people cannot campaign within 6 metres of a polling station. \"If a voter simply wears campaign material (ie a pin or shirt) into the polling place, casts their vote and leaves, it likely won't contravene the act,\" the AEC spokesperson said. \"However, if the voter wears that material into a polling place and is then seen talking with someone inside about it … that could be construed as campaigning.\"",
