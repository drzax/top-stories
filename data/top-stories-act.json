He's a wrecker, and it's much easier to punch down than to help lift up. \"And that is what the leader of the opposition sought to do, to wreck and to ruin, not to build and to inspire.\" Mackellar's independent MP Sophie Scamps said she was \"very proud\" of the way the debate was run in her electorate, blaming misinformation for the result. \"I do think there was a broad misinformation, disinformation campaign and Australians really had a lot of questions,\" Dr Scamps said. \"I think on the exit polls coming out, people on both sides of the campaign would like to know that they can trust the information that politicians are telling them. It is fundamental to our democracy.\" Earlier today, Mr Dutton said the country had spoken in \"overwhelming fashion\" by rejecting the proposal of the Voice to Parliament.",

The Treasurer Jim Chalmers and Assistant Treasurer Stephen Jones today released a proposal paper that, among other things, recommends requiring crypto platform operators to hold an Australian Financial Services Licence. The government is also planning to implement some additional specific minimum standards for the sector around holding tokens, custody software and transactions. The government says the proposals are broadly in line with regulation in other countries and will give crypto investors better protections against financial loss resulting from the collapse of an exchange. BTC Markets CEO Caroline Bower said her company has already been positioning itself for such regulation. \"Digital assets are so clearly the future of financial services. It is imperative the country keeps pace with our international peers, with a robust regulatory framework. \"BTC Markets has long agitated for appropriate, proportional regulation of the crypto industry in Australia.\" The banking sector has also welcomed the move via its lobby group, the Australian Banking Association, whose CEO Anna Bligh said it is a welcome step in the fight against scams. \"Almost half of scammed funds are currently being channelled into crypto, the getaway vehicle of choice for scammers,\" she said. \"Once the stolen money reaches a crypto exchange, it is virtually impossible to recover. \"This means no matter what financial services door a customer walks through, customers will be protected by the same regulatory standards.\" The government is inviting feedback on the proposal paper until December 1, with further consultation next year on the resulting draft legislation.",

Abermarle says it decided to dump the bid because there were \"growing complexities\" around the transaction. The US miner's decision comes days after Hancock Prospecting, the iron ore miner controlled by Gina Rinehart, increased its stake in Liontown to 19.9% —which would have likely been enough to block Abermarle's takeover bid of $3 a share. \"Our engagement with the Liontown team has been meaningful and productive. We appreciate the level of cooperation we have received, and we thank the entire team for their efforts,\" Albemarle CEO Kent Masters said in a statement. \"That said, moving forward with the acquisition, at this time, is not in Albemarle's best interests .\" Hancock Prospecting has not commented on the development. Liontown Resources entered a trading halt earlier this morning, shortly after making the announcement to the market. The company says the halt will remain in place until Liontown makes an announcement regarding the funding of its Kathleen Valley project, or Wednesday October 18 — whichever comes first.
