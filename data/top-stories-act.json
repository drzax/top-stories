              "plaintext": "The Australian share market has ended up posting solid gains, despite falls across the key mining and energy sectors. The ASX 200 index closed 0.6% higher at 7,295 points, while the All Ordinaries gained 0.5% to 7,489. Woolworths (ASX code WOW) was one of the market giants pushing the key indices higher, rising 2.4% to $39.54 after receiving an upgrade to buy from analysts at investment bank UBS. \"The sales outlook for Aust Food is positive due to more positive industry drivers and greater confidence that WOW can gain further market share,\" wrote analyst Shaun Cousins. \"Labour costs are rising but well progressed productivity initiatives and operating leverage support EBIT (profit) margin expansion.\" Despite its share outlook being maintained at neutral by UBS, rival Coles also got a share price boost today up 1.3% to $18.33. The other major weight pulling the market up was a 2.4% rebound for biotech giant CSL to $284.44. The gain today didn't make up for last week's much bigger slide, but was enough to help pull the ASX 200 higher, along with solid rises of 0.8 to 1.5% for the major banks. The big miners and energy firms weighed on the market with moderate declines, such as 1.2% for Rio Tinto, 0.7% for BHP and 0.3% for Woodside. However, many of the smaller players mining lithium or other materials needed for renewable energy took much bigger hits, with Lake Resources (-20%), Liontown Resources (-6%) and Chalice Mining (-5.6%) all down sharply. But old tech fossil fuel miners also got walloped, with coal companies New Hope Corporation (-5.8%) and Whitehaven Coal (-2.9%) also on the nose today. I'm off now and David Chau, who has you covered for 7pm finance tonight, will be back with the markets blog tomorrow morning.",

The next one of those will come on July 4 and, yes, the markets predict there is a better than 50 per cent chance of rates rising. But there is the release of the minutes from the RBA's most recent meeting, where it surprised by raising rates to 4.1% even though the market had priced in less than a 40% chance of rates rising. Those come out at 11:30am AEST. Following that, assistant governor Christopher Kent is part of a panel discussion at a derivatives conference, so probably unlikely to mention too much about rates and the economy. Later in the day, at 1:30pm AEST, deputy governor Michelle Bullock will give a speech on the topic of Achieving Full Employment to the AiGroup (a business group) in Newcastle. That sounds like a topic that will attract a lot more interest, especially given last week's much stronger than expected jobs numbers.",
