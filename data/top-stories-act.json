The IDF has published vision and a folder of photos appearing to show troops and bulldozers near Al Noor amusement park south of Gaza City. On Telegram, it said it located an underground tunnel running adjacent to the theme park and destroyed it. The folder of images also included a photo appearing to show soldiers and tanks in the vicinity of a different ferris wheel about 9 kilometres away. Map data analysed by the ABC indicates this ferris wheel is located near the Al Hilal (The Crescent) Sports Club, near the coast north of Gaza City. The IDF did not comment on what its soldiers were doing in this area in its Telegram post. In its update, it also said it had destroyed an \"underground tunnel shaft and a weapons warehouse\" containing chemicals and mines, found near a university, but the ABC could not identify the location from the provided vision. Earlier today the IDF said it was moving into the \"heart of Gaza city\". Both ferris wheels are located about 5km away from the city centre. The ABC could not independently verify when the IDF's photos were taken.",

Yesterday Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu raised the prospect of Israel taking control of the administration of the Gaza Strip once Hamas is defeated. \"Clearly Israel is going to have to exercise ultimate security control over the Gaza strip, because we saw what happened when we don't,\" Eylon Levy, spokesperson for the Israeli government, told Patricia Karvelas on RN Breakfast when asked to comment on Netanyahu's words. He said he could not go into detail on what \"ultimate security control\" would mean, but said the Gaza Strip would have to be demilitarised. The last 20 years since Israel withdrew its troops and settlers from the Gaza Strip were a \"failed experiment\", he said. When asked by about US officials' comments against an Israeli occupation of Gaza, Levy elaborated: \"When we talk about ultimate security for the Gaza strip, we are not talking about Israeli soldiers necessarily patrolling inside and being there all the time. \"We're going to need mechanisms and safeguards to ensure that the area is not taken over by terrorists the way that it has been over the last 20 years.\" Listen to the full interview on ABC RN Breakfast below.",

In statement the firm said: \"PwC Australia has today taken steps to adjust its workforce to address the divestment of its government business, a change in portfolio and strategic focus, as well as economic and business headwinds\" It said the firm's leadership informed staff and partners of the changes today in Adelaide, where 141 roles will be impacted and made redundant. The PwC Australia's Skilled Service Hub (SSH) in Adelaide, where the 141 jobs are being lost, supports PwC's public sector and corporate clients. The majority of those impacted roles are in PwC's trust and risk, and consulting teams. The firm said the hub was opened in 2021 \"in large part to support the firm's growing public sector business and the data sovereignty requirements of those clients, but in light of the Scyne divestment, the impact the past few months has had on our business, and broader market conditions, many of the workforce demands met by the delivery centre are no longer required\". PwC Australia CEO Kevin Burrowes also said a further 197 roles would be made redundant across the firm's general national workforce, in response to \"the reduction in the size of the business, the firm's changing portfolio and strategic areas of focus, and economic headwinds\". Included in the redundancies are the 75 staff who were unable to join Scyne Advisory and put on leave last week. \"We attempted to find alternative positions for these impacted staff within PwC, however, this was not always possible or desired by the individual given their client work, areas of expertise or skills,\" he said. \"These are extremely difficult decisions and my thoughts are with all of those people and their families impacted by the changes we have been forced to make. \"While we are optimistic about the future, PwC must take pragmatic action to manage these challenges and make difficult decisions to meet the needs of its clients and to ensure the long-term success of the firm.\" He added that other than a small number of Skills Service Hub Adelaide roles, PwC Australia is not making any audit team roles redundant. The firm also plans to transition 1,300 staff and 100 partners to Scyne Advisory, he said.",
