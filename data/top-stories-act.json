It would have been more so had they not lost Warner so late to such an innocuous ball, but I still think the Aussies hold the upper hand, with conditions seemingly getting better for batting and their two best players in the middle. Umesh Yadav was unable to maintain the pressure that Mohammed Shami and Mohammed Siraj applied early, but Shardul Thakur got the prized wicket of a seemingly in-form and relaxed David Warner to give India, who won the toss, hope. Good session all up though, what have you thought?",
