The comments by Hezbollah's deputy leader, Sheikh Naim Kassem, came as Israel shelled and made drone strikes in southern Lebanon and Hezbollah fired rockets and missiles toward Israel, according to the Associated Press. Hezbollah says six of its fighters were killed on Saturday. It isn't yet possible to independently verify the claim. For Hezbollah, heating up the Lebanon-Israel border has a clear purpose, Kassem says: \"We are trying to weaken the Israeli enemy and let them know that we are ready.\" There are concerns that Iran-backed Hezbollah, which is believed to have a large weapons arsenal, might try to open a new front in the Israel-Hamas war with a large-scale attack on northern Israel.
