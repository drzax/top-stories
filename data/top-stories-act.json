The gains were largely led by modest jumps in the financials and real estate sectors, up 0.8% and 0.7% respectively. Healthcare shed 1.6% while utilities and academic and educational services were down 0.5% each. The top five performers for the day were: Insurance Australia Group +4.6% Aurizon Holdings +4.5% New Hope Corporation +4.3% Coronado Global Resources +4% Fortescue Metals +3.6% At the other end, the bottom five stocks were: Imugene -9.5% Lynas Rare Earth -6.5% Syrah Resources -5% West African Resources -4.6% Pilbara Minerals -4.5% And that brings today's blog to a close — thanks for following along throughout the day.
