Speaking in Canberra about the figures, Mr Chalmers said the 1.2% September increase was consistent with Treasury forecasts, but warned further volatility in inflation is likely in coming months in response to oil markets and fuel prices. \"Production cuts and disruptions in global oil markets are a key driver of inflation in the global economy and here at home, with Australians facing higher fuel prices at the bowser,\" he said. \"Petrol prices increased 7.2% in the [September] quarter, contributing a quarter of a percentage point to quarterly inflation. \"We shouldn't be surprised to see some volatility in inflation figures going forward, particularly given the global uncertainty from the conflict in the Middle East and the war in Ukraine. \"We understand that inflation and higher interest rates that are already in the system are biting households hard and we're acting to make things a little easier.\"",

Given the RBA's \"hawkish rhetoric over the past two weeks\" and the \"uncomfortably high\" September quarter inflation data, ANZ says it's expecting the cash rate to reach its highest level since November 2011 — but noted the hike wasn't certain. \"The RBA has also highlighted risks of inflation expectations becoming embedded given ongoing shocks to energy prices, with consumers’ inflation expectations typically being quite responsive to petrol prices,\" ANZ's head of economics Adam Boyton wrote. \"While an additional interest rate increase will put further pressure on already strained finances across some households, the RBA’s most recent Financial Stability Review observed that households and businesses in Australia have, overall, coped reasonably well with the [4 percentage point] cash rate hikes so far. \"Having said that, a rate hike in November is not certain. Major inputs into the RBA’s longer-term inflation forecast are unlikely to have changed materially. \"Wages growth has generally undershot the RBA's expectations over this cycle, while the likely increase in productivity in Q3 should provide some comfort to the Bank that a reversion to the pre-COVID trend is plausible. That is, the longer-term inflation forecasts could well be unaffected by today's data. \"As a result, a decision to increase rates in November could well be a response to the risk that inflation might not return to target within a reasonable timeframe. A risk highlighted by the resilience of inflation in the [September inflation data].\"",
