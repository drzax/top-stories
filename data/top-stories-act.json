You can imagine having a 3-year-old and young baby, that is unimaginable.\"",

              "plaintext": "Earlier we told you about the 25 Australians of the Year that had put their name on a open letter urging a Yes vote on Saturday. Here is their open letter in full : As Australians of the Year, past and present, we wish to indicate our heartfelt support for a constitutionally enshrined Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Voice and respectfully urge Australians to vote 'Yes' in the upcoming referendum on October 14th. We respect the generous invitation extended within the Uluru Statement from the Heart to come together to recognise Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in the Australian Constitution, and ensure that they have a voice in government decision-making, especially in matters that impact on their daily realities. The Uluru statement responds to over two centuries of dispossession, pain and suffering with generosity and love. As First Peoples of this nation, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples' enduring connection with Australia stretches back for 60 thousand years, and represents the unique, intrinsic essence of our past, present and future. This truth has been ignored and denied until the very recent past, and we now are at a fork in the road. We must choose the high road to inclusiveness and respect. The low road leads us into a shameful dead end, with unimaginable consequences for our national identity and self respect. Many other nations with colonial histories similar to ours, notably Canada, Norway and New Zealand have already taken the high road. So we know that a mutually advantageous outcome is possible. Since colonisation Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples have been subjected to 235 years of destructive or ineffectual policies, which have had devastating impacts on cultural integrity and a slew of social and health outcomes. The effective exclusion of indigenous voices from decision-making has been at best useless and costly and, at worst, damaging, blocking any meaningful progress. There is overwhelming evidence that, when given a voice, services are effective and lead to improvements in outcomes, as happened during the Covid pandemic. The Voice is about ensuring that our First Nations people have a genuine say in matters that impact on their lives. For too long they have been worse than powerless. A Yes vote in this referendum represents a once in a lifetime opportunity to secure inclusion and respect, to empower, to make long overdue progress towards closing the gap, and to finally bring all of us together as Australians on a level playing field. It is not about giving one community an advantage but about reducing a severe and unacceptable level of disadvantage and discrimination. A Yes vote is a step to a more united and cohesive nation, conscious of the past and looking together to the future.",

There's been the flight credits saga, delayed and cancelled flights, customer service complaints, a class action, and an ACCC investigation over allegations it sold tickets for cancelled flights. But that was only the beginning — on top of Alan Joyce's early exit, the High Court's ruling that Qantas illegally sacked 1,700 ground crew, and the multi-million dollar payout for Joyce and its executives disclosed in its annual report. And it was just two weeks ago today that Richard Goyder, along with CEO Vanessa Hudson and Qantas' general counsel Andrew Finch, appeared at a Senate inquiry into the federal government's blocking of additional Qatar Airways flights. It was in that fiery hearing that Richard Goyder said not once, but twice, that he had the support of Qantas shareholders ( despite shareholders withdrawing their support for him a day earlier, and putting the rest of the board on notice ). As the popular saying goes, timing is everything — so why has Richard Goyder made the announcement now, when his exit isn't until sometime next year? The ABC's senior business correspondent Peter Ryan has unpacked what the timing means, how it will impact next month's annual general meeting in Melbourne, and how Qantas might move forward.

The TWU's statement references the High Court's unanimous ruling that Qantas acted illegally when it sacked about 1,700 ground crew and replaced them with contractors during the COVID-19 pandemic. The union says Mr Goyder should follow former CEO Alan Joyce in an early exit from the airline this year. TWU national secretary Michael Kaine believes Mr Goyder should depart sooner rather than later so he doesn't escape accountability, and allow for a total governance reset at the airline. \"This announcement is an attempt by Goyder to leave in a dignified manner with another year's pay in his pocket, after presiding over the largest case of illegal sackings in Australian history,\" Mr Kaine said. \"This isn't genuine board renewal, this is just shuffling the deckchairs. We need to put an end to illegal conduct being blindly rubber-stamped by a board that fails to scrutinise the CEO who is treated as their equal by having a place on the board. \"With no worker representation, Qantas governance has ignored the needs of the workforce and decimated jobs and standards. \" A fresh start for Qantas governance requires a new board composition that excludes the CEO and embeds a worker representative to avoid the repeat of colossal errors of judgement being repeated.\"",

Who do you think the Swans need more if they can only have one? - Chris G.. A couple of really interesting questions there. I do think they'll find a way to get both deals done. They'll likely need to deep into their future picks a little, but from my vantage point pick 25 feels like it should be used on Adams, and given the Demons are pretty keen to see Grundy head out the door, pick 33 (and a little something else) should be the foundations of a deal there. The Swans might need a little bit back to make sure they have enough points to match an inevitable bid for academy player Caiden Cleary on draft night, but they should have enough capital to keep everyone happy. But the second question is the really interesting one. From a list perspective, Grundy is the one they need most. Tom Hickey's retirement has left Peter Ladhams as the only real ruck option on the list, so that's a hole they badly need to fill. In saying that, I reckon Adams would have a huge impact in that Swans midfield. When fit and firing he is still a fantastic player, and a perfect foil for the likes of Warner, Gulden and Florent in the Sydney engine room.",
