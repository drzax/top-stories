He also believes First Nations communities around the country should have been properly polled to see if there was strong support for a Voice to Parliament from Indigenous people in the first place. \"I think that there should have been a plebiscite of the First Nations people first. And if that would have occurred, and we'd have got the majority of (our) people voting in that plebiscite saying 'Yes, we want to want to have a Voice' then my views probably would have changed as well from the current view that I have\" He also told the ABC that regardless of the referendum result, it's all meaningless unless the British Crown formally apologised to Indigenous peoples of Australia, as it did in 1995 when during a visit to New Zealand, Queen Elizabeth II personally delivered an apology from the British Crown to the Tainui people. Mr Hooper says he'd welcome a visit from King Charles III to Bourke in Western NSW where the head of the British monarchy could \"deliver the apology on Murrawarri country on behalf of The Crown to the First Nations people of this country\".",

That's according to the RBA's latest Financial Stability Review, which we've mentioned a bit on the blog today because it's essentially the central bank's temperature check of how the financial system (and our economy) is going and what risks lie ahead. It's kind of like our annual general health check up with our doctors, except the RBA does this twice a year. The main takeaways are really around the fact inflation and interest rates are still a big problem, and that's flowing through to a small group of borrowers with their mortgages — but that group is growing. The report notes that the share of owner-occupiers with variable rate mortgages that had expenses exceeding their income in July this year was around 5% — up from 1% in April 2022. That means they have little capacity to cut back on spending, and 30% of them are at risk of depleting their savings buffers, so are at higher risk of falling into arrears. And although there has been a substantial increase in calls to the National Debt Helpline, there's only a \"very small share of borrowers\" who are in negative equity, or when the value of their loan exceeds the value of their property. If you want some more detail about the review, senior business correspondent Peter Ryan has you covered:",

The American ABC news outlet has reported that Mr Trump told Mr Pratt the supposed number of nuclear warheads on US submarines, and how close they could get to a Russian submarine without being detected. The conversation is said to have taken place at Mr Trump's Mar-a-Lago club in Florida several months after he left office. The alleged conversation was not mentioned by federal prosecutors when they charged the former president with mishandling classified material, but ABC is reporting Mr Pratt — who is the chairman of paper and packaging companies, Visy and Pratt Industries — was interviewed. The American ABC news outlet has no affiliation with ABC News here in Australia. Mr Pratt has been contacted for comment and is not accused of wrongdoing, while a spokesperson for Mr Trump criticised what he called \"illegal leaks\" and said he'd always acted lawfully.
