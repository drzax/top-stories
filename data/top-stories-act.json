Soon after Hamas official Khaled Meshaal made the remarks on the captives — which include Israelis and non-Israelis taken hostage by Hamas on October 7 — the group's armed wing separately said the non-Israelis were \"guests\" who would be released \"when circumstances allow\". Israel's military says the group is holding 199 hostages in Gaza. Hamas says it has between 200 and 250. Hamas, which like other factions has long called for the release of the roughly 6,000 Palestinians in Israeli prisons, \"has what it needs to empty the prisons of all prisoners,\" Meshaal, a former Hamas chief who now heads its diaspora office in Doha, told AlAraby TV. Israel, which has bombarded Gaza with strikes that have killed hundreds of Palestinians, has said it would act to free the hostages while eliminating Hamas. The captives are believed to include nationals of countries including Thailand and Germany. Other countries have reported their citizens as missing. Israelis with dual nationality in countries including the US are also believed to have been kidnapped. In a video message, the spokesman of Hamas' armed wing, Abu Obeida, said Hamas has \"a group of detainees of different nationalities, these are our guests and we seek to protect them\". He added: \"We will release detainees of different nationalities when circumstances on the ground allow.\" He did not elaborate. Another senior Hamas official, Moussa Abu Marzouk, said on Monday that \"foreign prisoners cannot be released due to the continued Israeli bombing of the Gaza Strip\". Reuters",

Results from large banks Goldman Sachs, Bank of America, Morgan Stanley, pharmaceutical giant Johnson & Johnson, electric vehicle maker Tesla and video-streaming pioneer Netflix are due this week. Third-quarter earnings for S & P 500 companies are estimated to have increased 2.2 per cent year-over-year, according to LSEG data Friday. \"At least for today (Monday), this is a market that sees a stronger earnings season, a stronger week in terms of earnings,\" said Quincy Krosby, chief global strategist, LPL Financial in Charlotte, North Carolina. At the same time, global leaders were trying to make sure that the Middle East conflict \"remains contained,\" she said. The Dow Jones index rose 0.9 per cent, the S & P 500 gained 1.1 per cent and the Nasdaq Composite up 1.2 per cent.",
