Major miners are doing the heavy lifting, with BHP (+2.5%) and Fortescue (+2.9%) rising substantially. On the flipside, CSL shares have dropped sharply — down 7.9 per cent, dragging the health care sector with them. The biotech firm earlier flagged a bigger profit hit from foreign currency exchange rates than previously forecast. RBC Capital Markets analyst Craig Wong-Pan said CSL's update was disappointing in terms of its guidance for the next financial year. In the retail sector, Myer shares are down by 4 per cent, which may have something to do with a drop in sales at rival David Jones, as reported by The Australian. Elsewhere in the sector, retailers are mostly higher including Harvey Norman (+0.5%), Premier Investments (+0.9%) and JB Hi-Fi (+1%).",
