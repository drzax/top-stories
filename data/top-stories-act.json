Fortescue Metals (-1.1 per cent) and BHP (-1 per cent) are taking a hit. Wall Street traded sideways as investors await this week's decision by the Federal Reserve, where it is expected to keep official interest rates on hold at 5 to 5.25 per cent. Banks are also weighing with ANZ (-1.2 per cent) and the National Australia Bank (-1.1 per cent) doing the worst. Coal miner New Hope (-3.7 per cent) has gained after a rise in annual profit thanks to record demand coal and higher prices. Gold miners are doing the best with Ramelius Resources (+5 per cent) and Silver Lake Resources (4.3 per cent) making gains on the ASX 200. Doing the worst are semi conductor technology firm Weebit Nano (-7.1 per cent) and Afterpay owner Block (-4.5 per cent). That's after Alyssa Henry, the chief executive of Block's payment provider service, Square, is set to leave the business after more than nine years.",

The miner made a net profit of almost $1.1 billion for the 2023 financial year, up nearly 11 per cent from 2022. New Hope chief executive Rob Bishop says strong demand and global supply constraints pushed thermal coal prices to record levels in the first half of the year. “Exceptional performance across the business throughout FY23 enabled our team to capitalise on the market conditions, finishing the year with $730.7 million cash at bank, no debt following the convertible note repurchase and a net asset position of $2,525.3 million,” Mr Bishop said. Global coal consumption is at a record high thanks to strong growth in Asia outpacing falling demand in the US and Europe according to the International Energy Agency. Demand from the two largest coal users, China and India, offset demand falls in developed countries in 2022. New Hope sold coal for an average of $346.73 during the year, up from $281.84 in 2022. Investors get a final dividend of 21 cents a share, but that's down from the 31 cents a share they got in 2022. They also get a special dividend of 9 cents a share, but that is also down from the 25 cents a share they got last year. Mr Bishop says New Hope's results this year are \"outstanding' so how come the dividends are lower? with Reuters",

The Reserve Bank has signalled that inflation remains a clear and present danger to the economy and that another interest rate rise can’t be ruled out. That’s despite evidence that 12 interest rate rises since May last year are continuing to slow the economy with RBA board members warning inflation is still too high. While the RBA board left the cash rate on hold at its meeting a fortnight ago, the minutes released this morning show the battle to get 4.9 percent inflation back into the 2 to 3 percent target zone is far from over. While headline inflation is slowing, the minutes show concern that services inflation might take a while to decline and that the labour market remains tight with the jobless rate hovering around a 50 year low. “Were inflation to remain above target for an even longer period, this could cause inflation expectations to move higher which would likely require an even larger increase,” the minutes warn. Money markets only see an 8 percent probability of a cash rate rise to 4.35 percent at the RBA’s October meeting. Judo Bank economic adviser Warren Hogan sees the outside chance of a November rate rise on Melbourne Cup Day as the final nail in the coffin of inflation. Here's more on the RBA minutes from Peter Ryan.",
