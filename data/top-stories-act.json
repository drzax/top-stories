He says councils weren't treated as partners and Geelong made official complaints about the pressure being applied and lack of time they were given to make high-level decisions. He says these included a two-day deadline for the council to provide input on the Games planning. \"That was the standard that was set going forward for communication for the state government and the City of Greater Geelong,\" he says. He says Geelong's concerns went unanswered and were proved to be founded when, weeks later, the Games were cancelled. He says he received a phone call from the government 10 minutes before the premier's press conference to announce the cancellation of the games. \"It was a blow and it still is a blow to me,\" Cr Sullivan says.

Senator Henderson points to a figure in the business case referring to $205 million to $215 million to be provided by the federal government. YATES: That was an assumption that was directly given to us (by the Department of Jobs, Precincts and Regions). HENDERSON: Did the assumption have any basis of fact? YATES: Well, you'd have to ask the department what was the basis of its information … HENDERSON: Well hang on a minute … you're the one preparing the business case, don't you scrutinise the assumptions to be given? Do you ask the question 'was this a committed amount' or 'on what basis are we assuming that we will receive $205 million as a worst case and $215 million as a best case from the federal government?' YATES: That assumption was an assumption that was given to us. HENDERSON: You just take that at face value? You don't query it, you don't question it, you don't say well what's the basis for it? WALKER: We can't answer that question because to do so we might reveal information that's part of cabinet in-confidence. HENDERSON: Oh that's just rubbish! … That is just an absolute cop out.

Competitor airline Virgin Australia has slammed the government's call in recent days, with boss Jayne Hrdlicka criticising the move in a video released to staff. Today, the Australian Financial Review published comments from Assistant Treasurer Stephen Jones, explaining why the government decision to block the extra Qatar flights was in the national interest. “We can drive prices down but if we drive them down to a level where it's actually unsustainable to run an airline, instead of having two carriers we will design our markets in a way which will make it unsustainable for the existing Australian-based carrier,\" Mr Jones told the AFR in response to their questions. Asked about Mr Jones's comment this afternoon, Mr Joyce said granting traffic rights was a bilateral exercise. \"Various countries around the world protect the national interest and I think what the [assistant] treasurer was referring to is Australians should protect its own national interest, and that is making sure we get reciprocal or other arrangements when you grant traffic rights. \"I don't think anyone would say you should grant traffic rights that would mean that you are disadvantaged in the Australian national interest and I think the assistant treasurer was saying that in our mind and we would agree with that.\"",
