The local share market has managed a gain for its first session of the week, but by no means a substantial one. Nonetheless, a positive note to start on after posting a weekly gain last week. The ASX 200 has closed up by 0.1 per cent, making some ground through the afternoon after a lackluster start. Real estate, materials and energy were the best performing sectors of the session, while financials lagged, dragged down by losses for ANZ (-4%) and Macquarie (-2.4%) trading ex-dividend, as Michael explained earlier. The standout stock of the session was Invocare, after it received an improved takeover offer from a private equity group. Here are the rest of the biggest movers: Tomorrow, there'll be a bit of local data out, with the Reserve Bank board meeting minutes, which could provide some more insight into that unexpected hike in May, and Westpac's monthly consumer confidence index. David Chau will be with you tomorrow morning with a wrap of all the overseas market moves.",

The private equity firm looks set to have one foot in the grave, after Invocare's board indicated its support for the $13.00 a share bid, inclusive of a fully-franked dividend of up to 60 cents a share that could yield tax benefits for many shareholders. The latest offer is a 45% premium to Invocare's share price immediately prior to the initial bid, but it's a relatively small increase on the initial $12.65 a share offer that was rebuffed. The new offer has prompted Invocare to open up its books for TPG to do due diligence, but there's no guarantee a binding bid will arrive if the private equity firm finds any financial skeletons in the closet. If it does go ahead the deal gives Invocare an enterprise value of $2.2 billion showing the business of death is in rude health.",

              "plaintext": "ANZ economists Brian Martin and Tom Kenny have put together a useful summary of the US debt ceiling debate and risks of default. They are a little more relaxed than Rabobank's global strategists, but only a little. Here are some highlights (or lowlights): \"The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projects that, if the debt limit remains unchanged, the government's ability to continue spending using extraordinary measures will be exhausted by early June. In that event, many government workers could not get paid, social security and other payments would be at risk and the Treasury would be unable to borrow. Recession risks would intensify sharply.\" Just how bad could it get? Very, according to recent forecasts. \"The consequences of a default would be disastrous. \" US Council of Economic Advisors (CEA) estimates a short default would cause a 0.3% rise in unemployment and 0.6% contraction in GDP. A protracted default would cause a 5.0% rise in unemployment and 6.1% fall in GDP. \"A default would also provoke a sharp rise in yields and wreak havoc in all financial markets and the real economy in the US and internationally.\" So what do the ANZ economists think will happen? \"We think the most likely scenarios are: 1. A longer-term agreement. We see a limited possibility (less than 10%) of a longer-term deal to lift or suspend the debt limit along the lines of the Republican bill. For now, the parties are too far apart and there is limited time in lawmakers' diaries to broker a deal before the X date. 2. A short-term compromise. We think a deal to suspend the debt limit by a few months is the most likely outcome (around 90%). This would be a similar outcome to what happened in October2021 when Democrats and Republicans agreed to increase the debt limit by USD480bn. This was said to be enough to provide funding till December 2021 or early January 2022. On 14 December 2021 the House and Senate passed a bill that saw the debt limit increased to its current level of USD31.4trn. 3. No agreement and the US defaults. According to the US Treasury this has never happened. Since 1960, Congress has acted 78 times to raise, temporarily extend or revise the definition of the debt limit. We think there is around a 1% chance of a default. A recent Chicago Fed paper claims Credit Default Swap (CDS) spreads data imply the probability of a default is 1%. This would likely be higher now, given that CDS spreads are a little higher compared to when the paper was published.\" So, the most likely outcome is another kick of the can down the road.",
