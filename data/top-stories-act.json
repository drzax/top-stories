The Dow Jones index put on 0.6 per cent. New orders for US manufactured capital goods rose in May, sales of new single family homes surged, and US consumer confidence increased to the highest in nearly one and half years. And oil prices slumped more than 2 per cent on signs of more rate rises from central banks. The Australian dollar is trading around 66.87 US cents. Later this morning, the Bureau of Statistics will release consumer inflation figures for May. Inflation is expected to have risen by 6.1 per cent over the year, a pull back from the 6.8 per cent rise over the year to April. We will have the figures live when they are released at 11:30am AEST.",
