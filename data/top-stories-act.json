It’s not clear what that will mean for the other defendants, who District Attorney Fani Willis has said she wants to try at the same time. What does seem sure is that there will now be a flurry of legal filings as the lawyers for the 19 defendants in this case submit motions on why their client’s case should or shouldn’t be severed from the others. An October start date would on the face of it seem very ambitious and Donald Trump’s lawyers have already indicated they oppose it. By North America correspondent Barbara Miller",
