That's according to financial comparison website Finder. Finder says that would mean saving nearly $300,000 for a house deposit and $188,523 for a unit. Home loans expert at Finder, Richard Whitton, says many first home buyers simply can't afford to save such big deposits. “Wage growth over the past few decades simply hasn’t kept up with skyrocketing property prices. “Saving up enough for a deposit, especially when the cost of everything from food, energy, and insurance – not to mention rent – is rising, is a big barrier to overcome. “Buying a home is becoming increasingly out of reach for many Aussies.” New South Wales is the most expensive place to buy with households need to save for 20 years on average for a house deposit of $470,660. You can see why many people will never be able to get on the property ladder. The Northern Territory and Western Australia were the best places to save for a home deposit, with NT households needing to save for an average of 8 years for a $151,584 house deposit.",

Assistant Minister for Competition Andrew Leigh says Australia's productivity growth has slowed over the past decade and reduced competition has contributed. The review will look at competition laws, policies and institutions and a competition task force has been established in Treasury. The review will look at: Proposals put forward by the Australian      Competition and Consumer Commission around merger reform, as well as other      competition law issues Options for coordinated reform with states      and territories, to be progressed through the Council on Federal Financial      Relations Non-compete and related clauses that      restrict workers from shifting to a better-paying job Providing advice on competition issues      raised by new technologies, the net zero transformation and growth in the      care economy Former ACCC chair Rod Sims and current ACCC chair Gina Cass-Gottleib have called for stronger laws to stop mergers that entrench market power. \"We always need to get the balance right on merger reform,\" said Mr Leigh. \"The ACCC's proposals ... are serious proposals deserving of careful scrutiny\"",
