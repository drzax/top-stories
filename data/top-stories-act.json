Kim reportedly spent two days in the city, visiting a university, an aquarium and an animal food plant, among other facilities. It wrapped up his unusually lengthy, week-long trip to Russia, during which he pledged to step up military and economic cooperation with President Vladimir Putin. The visit will serve as \"an opportunity to further solidify the traditional bond of good-neighbourhood cooperation between the two countries, which are rooted in comradely friendship and military unity, and to open a new chapter in the development of relations\", KCNA said. The rare summit between Kim and Putin has prompted the United States and South Korea to warn against any weapons trade.
