The ABC's political reporter Claudia Long dropped by the blog a little earlier this afternoon to help unpack it all: Claudia: The federal government has its work cut out for it if they plan to use this budget to show young people they're important to Labor. Not only are under 30s contending with the same spiralling cost of living pressures as the rest of the country, young Australians are hard hit by issues around housing. Aside from the often completely out of reach task of buying a home, getting access to rent assistance isn't as straightforward when you're living in a sharehouse — something that isn't confined to under 30's but is certainly more common. And the rising price of pretty much everything hits even harder when you've barely had a chance to establish any savings if you've made it into the workforce. The federal government says they're going to be prioritising the most vulnerable if this budget, at 7:30pm tonight under 30s get to find out whether that includes them."

                  "articleBody": "By the specialist teporting team’s Leonie Thorne Last month Disability Services Minister Bill Shorten said the agency responsible for supporting Australians with disability had \"lost its way\" and needed significant work to ensure its survival. Advocates hope tonight's budget will shed more light on what that \"work\" involves. The government has already announced a new growth target, which would save more than $50 billion from the NDIS over the next decade. Spending on the scheme was projected to grow about 14 per cent annually over the next decade. The new target will limit that to 8 per cent by 2026. We also know the government is planning to crack down on price-gouging NDIS providerswho overcharge people with disability. \"If you have a business model where you are mining someone's supported independent living package for your own interests … sell your business now, because it's not going to be worth much by the time we're finished with you,\" Mr Shorten told reporters a few weeks ago. The government is also allocating more than $720 million over four years to overhaul the NDIA — the agency which runs the NDIS. What we DON'T know is how the government plans to limit the NDIS's growth, and what changes participants can expect. Disability advocates were shocked and “disappointed” by the growth target, saying they were blindsided by the announcement. Many people in the disability sector are also tired of discourse around reining in the cost of the NDIS, saying it should instead be seen as an investment that has changed the lives of thousands of Australians for the better."

The ABC's political reporter Tahlia Roy joins us, and says the budget measure will see single parents supported until their youngest dependent turns 14. Tahlia: It is slated to take effect from September 20 and will see an additional 57,000 single parents able to access more than $900 per fortnight. In 2006, the Howard Coalition government changed the eligibility requirements for the payment, lowering the age limit from 16 to eight years old. The decision was grandfathered, so people already on the scheme could remain on it. The Gillard Labor government in 2012 scrapped the grandfathering, moving people with a child older than 8 but younger than 16 onto an unemployment benefit."

The dramatic turnaround from the $36.9 billion deficit projected in October has been driven by high commodity prices, a strong jobs market and a boost in net migration. But Stephen Koukoulas of Market Economics says the federal budget surplus is not expected to last. Stephen: Key commodities that delivered that surging company profit tax have already started to weaken. So that's going to put a hole in future government revenue. And of course, the government is delivering on its election promises from last year. Things like the childcare payments, the increase in the Jobseeker amounts of funding."

Bailey : So that's when you're considered independent from your parents, and it's a bit weird, because when you're 18 you can drink, you can drive, you can legally be arrested, you're basically considered an adult except for Centrelink. So over 450,000 students are locked out from Youth Allowance and Austudy payments because of the age of independence."

If the government wants to halt the extinction crisis — as it said it did during the election — that needs to change. For context, Australia currently holds the crowning achievement of having more mammal extinctions than any other continent. With that in mind, here are some things we’re keeping an eye out for in tonight’s budget: Environment law reform : This was a central part of the government’s election platform, so we’re looking to see what money goes towards the promised new federal Environmental Protection Authority, and what funding there is to get the environmental laws rewritten Water policy: We’re expecting to see some money for water market reform, and also looking out for funding for a promised review of the Murray Darling Basin Plan Local waterways: Speaking of water, Labor also promised to help clean up local waterways through a new “Urban Rivers and Catchments Program”. We’re looking out for funding for that too Threatened species : Last October, Labor announced a zero extinctions target – so we might see a little bit of extra money go towards some threatened species programs Nature markets: The government also has the big “Nature Repair Market” program, which aims to entice businesses to invest in nature ( read more about the debate here ). We’re expecting to see some funding for that"

Political reporter Nour Haydar has more: Nour: Anthony Albanese went to the last election with a pledge to “make childcare cheaper” and the changes Labor promised will soon kick in. From July 2023, more than 1.2 million families will be able to access higher childcare subsidies. Under legislation that has already been passed by the parliament, families earning $80,000 or less will get 90 percent of the childcare fees subsidised. Higher subsidy rates will also apply for families earning under $530,000. The government says the changes will benefit 96 per cent of families with a child in early childhood education and care and will cost $55 billion over the next four years to 2026-27."

That time is when I'll be joining you right here to let you know everything I've found out over that six hours. Once his budget speech is over, the treasurer will join the ABC's federal budget television special for an interview. We'll also have an interview with the shadow treasurer, Angus Taylor."

                  "articleBody": "In healthcare, one of the big things to watch for tonight will be Medicare. The specialist reporting team's Penny Timms is here to help sort through it all: Penny: You might remember that last year, the federal government asked a team of experts to put their heads together and come up with recommendations on how to improve access to primary care and reduce the load on hospitals. Their Strengthening Medicare report, released in February, called for a rethink of how Australia funds primary care and GPs – but did not result in any immediate announcements. At the time, medical experts criticised the report for not including enough detail. So, a lot of people in healthcare will be looking out for the Strengthening Medicare Taskforce’s suggested reforms, and detail on how they will actually happen. The government has talked a big game, and if it doesn't do much, that is likely to be a talking point. During the election, Labor promised close to $1 billion for Medicare and GPs. Of that cash, $750 million was earmarked for the Strengthening Medicare scheme. Now the healthcare sector is waiting to see how it’s spent. One other area to watch is whether this budget will include funding for the promised Centre for Disease Control (CDC), which would better prepare Australia for national health emergencies. Last year’s October “mini-budget” included $3.2 million for “preparations to establish” the CDC. The government and health advocates have already flagged such a centre would require significant additional funding."

So, you know, you'll see different measures as part of that cost of living package. But I think what it shows is that, that really has been front and center our thinking as we finalise the budget... How to provide that sensible and affordable cost of living relief against, you know, an environment of high inflation and that's been certainly a challenge as we've been making our decisions, but people will see the full details of that."

It’s expected tonight’s package will see roughly 5 million households, and 1 million businesses, receive up to $500 in relief from their power bills. The support is expected to primarily be targeted at pensioners, others on government payments and small businesses. It’s also likely that rather than being paid directly to households, the relief will come as subsidies on energy bills. But the arrangements could become quite complex, as the federal government coordinates its package with various state and territory governments, and energy retailers."

The ABC's political reporter Claudia Long dropped by the blog a little earlier this afternoon to help unpack it all: Claudia: The federal government has its work cut out for it if they plan to use this budget to show young people they're important to Labor. Not only are under 30s contending with the same spiralling cost of living pressures as the rest of the country, young Australians are hard hit by issues around housing. Aside from the often completely out of reach task of buying a home, getting access to rent assistance isn't as straightforward when you're living in a sharehouse — something that isn't confined to under 30's but is certainly more common. And the rising price of pretty much everything hits even harder when you've barely had a chance to establish any savings if you've made it into the workforce. The federal government says they're going to be prioritising the most vulnerable if this budget, at 7:30pm tonight under 30s get to find out whether that includes them.",

Advocates hope tonight's budget will shed more light on what that \"work\" involves. The government has already announced a new growth target, which would save more than $50 billion from the NDIS over the next decade. Spending on the scheme was projected to grow about 14 per cent annually over the next decade. The new target will limit that to 8 per cent by 2026. We also know the government is planning to crack down on price-gouging NDIS providerswho overcharge people with disability. \"If you have a business model where you are mining someone's supported independent living package for your own interests … sell your business now, because it's not going to be worth much by the time we're finished with you,\" Mr Shorten told reporters a few weeks ago. The government is also allocating more than $720 million over four years to overhaul the NDIA — the agency which runs the NDIS. What we DON'T know is how the government plans to limit the NDIS's growth, and what changes participants can expect. Disability advocates were shocked and “disappointed” by the growth target, saying they were blindsided by the announcement. Many people in the disability sector are also tired of discourse around reining in the cost of the NDIS, saying it should instead be seen as an investment that has changed the lives of thousands of Australians for the better.",

The ABC's political reporter Tahlia Roy joins us, and says the budget measure will see single parents supported until their youngest dependent turns 14. Tahlia: It is slated to take effect from September 20 and will see an additional 57,000 single parents able to access more than $900 per fortnight. In 2006, the Howard Coalition government changed the eligibility requirements for the payment, lowering the age limit from 16 to eight years old. The decision was grandfathered, so people already on the scheme could remain on it. The Gillard Labor government in 2012 scrapped the grandfathering, moving people with a child older than 8 but younger than 16 onto an unemployment benefit.",

The dramatic turnaround from the $36.9 billion deficit projected in October has been driven by high commodity prices, a strong jobs market and a boost in net migration. But Stephen Koukoulas of Market Economics says the federal budget surplus is not expected to last. Stephen: Key commodities that delivered that surging company profit tax have already started to weaken. So that's going to put a hole in future government revenue. And of course, the government is delivering on its election promises from last year. Things like the childcare payments, the increase in the Jobseeker amounts of funding.",

If the government wants to halt the extinction crisis — as it said it did during the election — that needs to change. For context, Australia currently holds the crowning achievement of having more mammal extinctions than any other continent. With that in mind, here are some things we’re keeping an eye out for in tonight’s budget: Environment law reform : This was a central part of the government’s election platform, so we’re looking to see what money goes towards the promised new federal Environmental Protection Authority, and what funding there is to get the environmental laws rewritten Water policy: We’re expecting to see some money for water market reform, and also looking out for funding for a promised review of the Murray Darling Basin Plan Local waterways: Speaking of water, Labor also promised to help clean up local waterways through a new “Urban Rivers and Catchments Program”. We’re looking out for funding for that too Threatened species : Last October, Labor announced a zero extinctions target – so we might see a little bit of extra money go towards some threatened species programs Nature markets: The government also has the big “Nature Repair Market” program, which aims to entice businesses to invest in nature ( read more about the debate here ). We’re expecting to see some funding for that",

Political reporter Nour Haydar has more: Nour: Anthony Albanese went to the last election with a pledge to “make childcare cheaper” and the changes Labor promised will soon kick in. From July 2023, more than 1.2 million families will be able to access higher childcare subsidies. Under legislation that has already been passed by the parliament, families earning $80,000 or less will get 90 percent of the childcare fees subsidised. Higher subsidy rates will also apply for families earning under $530,000. The government says the changes will benefit 96 per cent of families with a child in early childhood education and care and will cost $55 billion over the next four years to 2026-27.",

The specialist reporting team's Penny Timms is here to help sort through it all: Penny: You might remember that last year, the federal government asked a team of experts to put their heads together and come up with recommendations on how to improve access to primary care and reduce the load on hospitals. Their Strengthening Medicare report, released in February, called for a rethink of how Australia funds primary care and GPs – but did not result in any immediate announcements. At the time, medical experts criticised the report for not including enough detail. So, a lot of people in healthcare will be looking out for the Strengthening Medicare Taskforce’s suggested reforms, and detail on how they will actually happen. The government has talked a big game, and if it doesn't do much, that is likely to be a talking point. During the election, Labor promised close to $1 billion for Medicare and GPs. Of that cash, $750 million was earmarked for the Strengthening Medicare scheme. Now the healthcare sector is waiting to see how it’s spent. One other area to watch is whether this budget will include funding for the promised Centre for Disease Control (CDC), which would better prepare Australia for national health emergencies. Last year’s October “mini-budget” included $3.2 million for “preparations to establish” the CDC. The government and health advocates have already flagged such a centre would require significant additional funding.",

Speaking to ABC News Breakfast, Finance Minister Katy Gallagher said it's a \"significant package\". Kate Gallagher : Not just in the scale, but in the reach that we're trying to have with it. So, you know, you'll see different measures as part of that cost of living package. But I think what it shows is that, that really has been front and center our thinking as we finalise the budget... How to provide that sensible and affordable cost of living relief against, you know, an environment of high inflation and that's been certainly a challenge as we've been making our decisions, but people will see the full details of that.",

The ABC's political reporter Tom Lowrey joins us, and says it's likely the relief will come in the form of subsidies on energy bills, as opposed to direct payments to households: Tom: For months the federal government has been talking up energy price relief as a “centrepiece” of the budget, and tonight they will finally put some detail to the rhetoric. $1.5bn was pledged in December to help Australians push their power bills down, which would be matched by the states and territories. It’s expected tonight’s package will see roughly 5 million households, and 1 million businesses, receive up to $500 in relief from their power bills. The support is expected to primarily be targeted at pensioners, others on government payments and small businesses. It’s also likely that rather than being paid directly to households, the relief will come as subsidies on energy bills. But the arrangements could become quite complex, as the federal government coordinates its package with various state and territory governments, and energy retailers.",

The ABC's political reporter Claudia Long dropped by the blog a little earlier this afternoon to help unpack it all: Claudia: The federal government has its work cut out for it if they plan to use this budget to show young people they're important to Labor. Not only are under 30s contending with the same spiralling cost of living pressures as the rest of the country, young Australians are hard hit by issues around housing. Aside from the often completely out of reach task of buying a home, getting access to rent assistance isn't as straightforward when you're living in a sharehouse — something that isn't confined to under 30's but is certainly more common. And the rising price of pretty much everything hits even harder when you've barely had a chance to establish any savings if you've made it into the workforce. The federal government says they're going to be prioritising the most vulnerable if this budget, at 7:30pm tonight under 30s get to find out whether that includes them.",

Tahlia: It is slated to take effect from September 20 and will see an additional 57,000 single parents able to access more than $900 per fortnight. In 2006, the Howard Coalition government changed the eligibility requirements for the payment, lowering the age limit from 16 to eight years old. The decision was grandfathered, so people already on the scheme could remain on it. The Gillard Labor government in 2012 scrapped the grandfathering, moving people with a child older than 8 but younger than 16 onto an unemployment benefit.",

The dramatic turnaround from the $36.9 billion deficit projected in October has been driven by high commodity prices, a strong jobs market and a boost in net migration. But Stephen Koukoulas of Market Economics says the federal budget surplus is not expected to last. Stephen: Key commodities that delivered that surging company profit tax have already started to weaken. So that's going to put a hole in future government revenue. And of course, the government is delivering on its election promises from last year. Things like the childcare payments, the increase in the Jobseeker amounts of funding.",

The Commonwealth Bank (+0.2 per cent) recouped a 1 per cent early loss after delivering a rise in quarterly profit, but warning of a rise in loan losses because of higher interest rates. And the Australian dollar (-0.15 per cent) slipped to 67.72 US cents after weak Chinese trade data. It rose above 68 US cents overnight to a three week high. Chinese imports contracted sharply in April, while exports also slowed. Inbound shipments fell 7.9 per cent over the year, while exports rose 8.5 per cent, easing back from a nearly 15 per cent annual surge in March."

                  "articleBody": "The Federal Government will outline plans to raise oil and gas taxes in tonight's budget, but the \"teal independents\" on the cross bench and the Greens say the changes don't go far enough. Treasurer Jim Chalmers says the Petroleum Resource Rent Tax will be increased to bring in an extra $2.4 billion over the next four years. But the government needs the support of Parliament to pass the changes. Independent MP Sophie Scamps wants the tax to be redesigned to raise more money from fossil fuel giants. \"The government's timid changes to our PRRT means that Australians will be continued to be duded when it comes to the sale of our offshore resources and we've got to remember that these resources belong to all Australians and at the moment we are just not benefiting as we should be,\" she said. The PRRT is a 40 per cent tax on the income from offshore projects and has long been criticised for not raising enough money from energy giants. That's because the costs can be deducted and used as tax credits to reduce income tax. Projects that come under the PRRT are not charged royalties or excise. The changes mean that rather than allowing companies to fully deduct their project costs against income, deductions will be capped at 90 per cent. The oil and gas industry has welcomed the planned changes saying that they already pay their fair share of tax. Lobby group, the Australian Petroleum Production & Exploration Association, says the changes get the balance right \"between the undeniable need for a strong gas sector to support reliable electricity and domestic manufacturing for decades to come and the need for a more sustainable national budget\". \"PRRT revenues are already at their highest level ever, forecast to deliver revenue of more than $11 billion over the forward estimates,\" APPEA chief executive Samantha McCulloch said. However, multinational tax expert, Jason Ward, from the Centre for International Corporate Tax Accountability and Research, told me on ABC News Channel that the PRRT needs to be higher."

The CBA says the index was led lower by reduced spending in home buying, health and fitness, transport, and household services. Higher energy bills saw spending on utilities continue to climb, up by 7 per cent from April last year, the fastest since 2018. CBA chief economist Stephen Halmarick says household spending is being hit by the higher cost of borrowing, with annual spending rates edging down. \"With the RBA increasing interest rates again in early May to 3.85 per cent we consider monetary policy to be highly restrictive,\" Mr Halmarick said. \"We continue to expect the lagged effect of higher interest rates to see household spending weaken as the year progresses.\""

                  "articleBody": "The higher cost of living is hurting hip pockets. The Bureau of Statistics says consumers are cutting back, with the annual pace of household spending slowing down. Household spending rose 8.2 per cent over the year to March with spending increasing for both goods and services. It rose by nearly 12 per cent in February from a year ago, which was the weakest annual growth since March last year. The March increase was driven by spending on hotels, cafes and restaurants, which saw a 23 per cent increase in spending, and a 16 per cent rise in transport costs. ABS head of business indicators Robert Ewing said inflation was making prices more expensive and therefore increasing spending. \"Rising prices are contributing to this growth,\" he said. \"Services price inflation rose 6.1 per cent - it's largest rise since 2001 - and goods price inflation rose 7.6 per cent (over the year to March).\""

The other big banks have also been offering thousands of dollars in cashbacks to new mortgage borrowers, including those who are switching lenders for a better deal (refinancing). But the banks are starting to cut back on the deals with the CBA ceasing its offer from June 1. In addition, RateCity says over the past couple of months, CBA and the other big banks have been reducing discounts for new mortgage customers, including raising rates above Reserve Bank increases. \"Cashback deals have become a hot potato for the banks, with CBA the first of the big four to drop them this year,\" said RateCity research director Sally Tindall. \"The big banks have been at the centre of the refinancing storm over the last 12 months, throwing down competitive new customer discounts and cold hard cash to tempt borrowers to switch.\" \"Now they are looking to take shelter from it.\" \"The other big banks could well fold on their cashback deals in coming months, but if they're looking for growth, they've just been handed a reason to keep these deals on the table.\""

Qantas is appealing a ruling that found outsourcing ground crew jobs during the pandemic was illegal. The Federal Court has twice ruled in favour of the Transport Workers Union, who say the outsourcing decision breached the Fair Work Act. Qantas has told the High Court that it gave the union and workers the chance to come up with an alternative plan, but their proposed savings were dwarfed by the $100 million that outsourcing would achieve. The airline also said its decision was made at a time where workers had \"less muscle\" for industrial action because they weren't working. The Transport Workers Union told reporters today that half of the 1700 ground staff sacked by Qantas in 2020 are yet to find meaningful work, while a third are suffering mental distress. TWU national secretary, Michael Kaine, says Qantas should be compensating workers, instead of \"spending eye watering amounts in legal warfare.\" \"The Transport Workers Union, and we understand the Minister for Industrial Relations, will ask the court to dismiss the case.\" \"In essence, we'll be saying that the Fair Work Act is designed to protect workers, allow them to exercise their workplace rights, not give companies like Qantas open slather to sack workers.\" Here's the background from High Court reporter Elizabeth Byrne."

Spending on infrastructure is the big ticket item, with a record $2.1 billion spend next financial year, mainly on transport. The budget doesn't factor in potential revenue from big projects like fracking, which have not been given the green light. However, the forecast surplus relies on major projects going ahead, in particular, Santos' controversial Barossa gas project in the Timor Sea, which is being challenged by traditional owners. Here's more from the ABC's Matt Garrick."

                  "articleBody": "There's more signs of the strain that higher interest rates are putting on households, with people buying less but paying higher prices. The latest quarterly data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics shows that retail sales volumes fell 0.6 per cent over the first few months of the year to $96.17 billion, following a 0.3 per cent fall over the December quarter. ABS head of retail statistics Ben Dorber says retail sales volumes dropped as the higher cost of living pressures weighed on household spending. “Outside of the COVID-19 pandemic period, this is the largest fall in retail sales volumes since the September quarter 2009,” Mr Dorber said. \"Retail prices rose for the sixth straight quarter, but price growth this quarter is the smallest since September 2021.\" That was because of discounts on clothing and large household items like furniture and electronic goods. Food prices went up, and sales at cafes, restaurants, and takeaway food services rose, boosted by the return of cultural and sporting events."

They were used by then opposition leader Bill Hayden during a Labor Party leadership spill in February 1983. Mr Hayden resigned as party leader and then shadow industrial relations minister Bob Hawke was elected as leader. Afterwards Mr Hayden said \"a drover's dog could lead the Labor Party to victory, the way the country is.\" The Labor party won the election and Mr Hawke became prime minister. So Mr Taylor's inspiration comes from the Labor Party! Here's more on the budget and the \"drover's dog\" from senior business correspondent Peter Ryan."

                  "articleBody": "It's been a big week for bank profits, and the Commonwealth Bank is the last big bank to announce its results. CBA March quarter profit: $2.6 billion unaudited net profit, up from $2.3 billion last year $2.6 billion cash profit, up 10 per cent from December quarter Net interest income down 2 per cent because of mortgage market competition Expenses up 7 per cent because of higher compensation costs $223 million loan impairments Cash earnings were better than expected as higher home and business lending offset squeezed profit margins because of tough competition for loans. CBA says there were \"continued competitive pressure in home loan pricing and customers switching to higher yielding deposits.\" \"Competition for home loans has remained intense in Australia and New Zealand.\" Home lending rose $6.9 billion over the quarter, household deposits were up $6.2 billion, and business lending increased by $2.6 billion. But troubled and impaired assets rose to $6.7 billion, up from $6.3 billion at the end of 2023. The bank says home loan arrears remain low at 0.44 per cent (+0.01 per cent), but consumer finance arrears increased during the quarter with personal loan (+ 0.14 per cent) and credit card (+0.05 per cent) arrears rising. \"We expect to see further increases in arrears rates as the full effects of interest rate increases are borne by borrowers in the month's ahead,\" the bank said. CBA chief executive Matt Comyn says higher interest rates are hurting customers and he expects the economy to slow down. \"Many of our customers are feeling the strain of higher interest rates and the rising cost of living,\" he said. \"As higher interest rates impact the Australian economy in the period ahead, we expect economic growth to continue to moderate.\" \"Despite the challenging global economic outlook, Australia is relatively well positioned given the strength of our banking system, the economic tailwinds from a recovery in population growth, and relatively high commodity prices.\""

                  "headline": "PwC boss departs amid tax scandal",
                  "articleBody": "Hi team, Before we get lost in Budget chat, let's not let pass up big news from last night. Boss steps down Tom Seymour, the CEO of consulting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), stepped down last night in the middle of a growing scandal. Here's the summary of the mind-blowing scandal, backed up by emails published as part of a Senate inqury. What happened The government asked a PwC tax expert to help it write laws to better tax multinational companies. That expert - Peter-John Collins - used the secret knowledge to help PwC create a system for those companies to avoid paying the new taxes. The company used the scheme to make money and win new clients, and then gloated about it. Booted It came to light when former partner Peter-John Collins was banned by the Tax Practitioners Board disqualified him for a two year period because he \"did not act with integrity\" and \"failed to have in place adequate arrangements to manage conflicts of interest\". Multinational companies sometimes use a complex and expensive process of 'profit-shifting' to take money they've made in higher-taxing countries like Australia to countries like Singapore and The Netherlands where company tax rates are lower. The process is legal, but controversial. Boss gone too Mr Seymour has attempted to minimise the scope of the people involved in the scandal. New documents revealed more people - including him - were aware of the information. (Some may not have been aware of the way in which the information about the new laws came to be in their possession - through Peter-John Collins breaching confidentiality provisions). As of last night, Mr Seymour is no longer CEO. Here's some of the statement. After discussion with the PwC Australia Board of Partners, Tom Seymour is stepping down as CEO, effective immediately. We have appointed our Assurance Leader, Kristin Stubbins, to serve as acting CEO. In the coming months a new CEO will be elected by the Partners. We agreed with Tom that this is in the best interests of the firm and our stakeholders. Given the federal government is the biggest client of PwC and there's currently a Senate hearing into use of consultants by the public service the timing couldn't have been worse."

Wall Street was lacklustre overnight after Friday's stellar performance thanks to a fall in the US unemployment rate, and Apple's better than expected quarterly earnings. Disappointing company profit reports weighed on the market with drug manufacturer Catalent (-25.7 per cent) tanking after warning of a $US400 million cut to its annual revenue and profit forecasts. Meanwhile, Tyson Foods slumped (-16.4 per cent) after making a loss over the second quarter. The Dow Jones index fell 0.2 per cent, the S & P 500 was flat, while the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.2 per cent. And as Australian investors await tonight's federal budget, the ASX SPI 200 is down 0.1 per cent, indicating a slow start for the local share market. So join me today for all the markets news."

Treasurer Jim Chalmers says the Petroleum Resource Rent Tax will be increased to bring in an extra $2.4 billion over the next four years. But the government needs the support of Parliament to pass the changes. Independent MP Sophie Scamps wants the tax to be redesigned to raise more money from fossil fuel giants. \"The government's timid changes to our PRRT means that Australians will be continued to be duded when it comes to the sale of our offshore resources and we've got to remember that these resources belong to all Australians and at the moment we are just not benefiting as we should be,\" she said. The PRRT is a 40 per cent tax on the income from offshore projects and has long been criticised for not raising enough money from energy giants. That's because the costs can be deducted and used as tax credits to reduce income tax. Projects that come under the PRRT are not charged royalties or excise. The changes mean that rather than allowing companies to fully deduct their project costs against income, deductions will be capped at 90 per cent. The oil and gas industry has welcomed the planned changes saying that they already pay their fair share of tax. Lobby group, the Australian Petroleum Production & Exploration Association, says the changes get the balance right \"between the undeniable need for a strong gas sector to support reliable electricity and domestic manufacturing for decades to come and the need for a more sustainable national budget\". \"PRRT revenues are already at their highest level ever, forecast to deliver revenue of more than $11 billion over the forward estimates,\" APPEA chief executive Samantha McCulloch said. However, multinational tax expert, Jason Ward, from the Centre for International Corporate Tax Accountability and Research, told me on ABC News Channel that the PRRT needs to be higher.",

Household spending rose 8.2 per cent over the year to March with spending increasing for both goods and services. It rose by nearly 12 per cent in February from a year ago, which was the weakest annual growth since March last year. The March increase was driven by spending on hotels, cafes and restaurants, which saw a 23 per cent increase in spending, and a 16 per cent rise in transport costs. ABS head of business indicators Robert Ewing said inflation was making prices more expensive and therefore increasing spending. \"Rising prices are contributing to this growth,\" he said. \"Services price inflation rose 6.1 per cent - it's largest rise since 2001 - and goods price inflation rose 7.6 per cent (over the year to March).\"",

The other big banks have also been offering thousands of dollars in cashbacks to new mortgage borrowers, including those who are switching lenders for a better deal (refinancing). But the banks are starting to cut back on the deals with the CBA ceasing its offer from June 1. In addition, RateCity says over the past couple of months, CBA and the other big banks have been reducing discounts for new mortgage customers, including raising rates above Reserve Bank increases. \"Cashback deals have become a hot potato for the banks, with CBA the first of the big four to drop them this year,\" said RateCity research director Sally Tindall. \"The big banks have been at the centre of the refinancing storm over the last 12 months, throwing down competitive new customer discounts and cold hard cash to tempt borrowers to switch.\" \"Now they are looking to take shelter from it.\" \"The other big banks could well fold on their cashback deals in coming months, but if they're looking for growth, they've just been handed a reason to keep these deals on the table.\"",

Qantas is appealing a ruling that found outsourcing ground crew jobs during the pandemic was illegal. The Federal Court has twice ruled in favour of the Transport Workers Union, who say the outsourcing decision breached the Fair Work Act. Qantas has told the High Court that it gave the union and workers the chance to come up with an alternative plan, but their proposed savings were dwarfed by the $100 million that outsourcing would achieve. The airline also said its decision was made at a time where workers had \"less muscle\" for industrial action because they weren't working. The Transport Workers Union told reporters today that half of the 1700 ground staff sacked by Qantas in 2020 are yet to find meaningful work, while a third are suffering mental distress. TWU national secretary, Michael Kaine, says Qantas should be compensating workers, instead of \"spending eye watering amounts in legal warfare.\" \"The Transport Workers Union, and we understand the Minister for Industrial Relations, will ask the court to dismiss the case.\" \"In essence, we'll be saying that the Fair Work Act is designed to protect workers, allow them to exercise their workplace rights, not give companies like Qantas open slather to sack workers.\" Here's the background from High Court reporter Elizabeth Byrne.",

The latest quarterly data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics shows that retail sales volumes fell 0.6 per cent over the first few months of the year to $96.17 billion, following a 0.3 per cent fall over the December quarter. ABS head of retail statistics Ben Dorber says retail sales volumes dropped as the higher cost of living pressures weighed on household spending. “Outside of the COVID-19 pandemic period, this is the largest fall in retail sales volumes since the September quarter 2009,” Mr Dorber said. \"Retail prices rose for the sixth straight quarter, but price growth this quarter is the smallest since September 2021.\" That was because of discounts on clothing and large household items like furniture and electronic goods.

CBA March quarter profit: $2.6 billion unaudited net profit, up from $2.3 billion last year $2.6 billion cash profit, up 10 per cent from December quarter Net interest income down 2 per cent because of mortgage market competition Expenses up 7 per cent because of higher compensation costs $223 million loan impairments Cash earnings were better than expected as higher home and business lending offset squeezed profit margins because of tough competition for loans. CBA says there were \"continued competitive pressure in home loan pricing and customers switching to higher yielding deposits.\" \"Competition for home loans has remained intense in Australia and New Zealand.\" Home lending rose $6.9 billion over the quarter, household deposits were up $6.2 billion, and business lending increased by $2.6 billion. But troubled and impaired assets rose to $6.7 billion, up from $6.3 billion at the end of 2023. The bank says home loan arrears remain low at 0.44 per cent (+0.01 per cent), but consumer finance arrears increased during the quarter with personal loan (+ 0.14 per cent) and credit card (+0.05 per cent) arrears rising. \"We expect to see further increases in arrears rates as the full effects of interest rate increases are borne by borrowers in the month's ahead,\" the bank said. CBA chief executive Matt Comyn says higher interest rates are hurting customers and he expects the economy to slow down. \"Many of our customers are feeling the strain of higher interest rates and the rising cost of living,\" he said. \"As higher interest rates impact the Australian economy in the period ahead, we expect economic growth to continue to moderate.\" \"Despite the challenging global economic outlook, Australia is relatively well positioned given the strength of our banking system, the economic tailwinds from a recovery in population growth, and relatively high commodity prices.\"",

Boss steps down Tom Seymour, the CEO of consulting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), stepped down last night in the middle of a growing scandal. Here's the summary of the mind-blowing scandal, backed up by emails published as part of a Senate inqury. What happened The government asked a PwC tax expert to help it write laws to better tax multinational companies. That expert - Peter-John Collins - used the secret knowledge to help PwC create a system for those companies to avoid paying the new taxes. The company used the scheme to make money and win new clients, and then gloated about it. Booted It came to light when former partner Peter-John Collins was banned by the Tax Practitioners Board disqualified him for a two year period because he \"did not act with integrity\" and \"failed to have in place adequate arrangements to manage conflicts of interest\". Multinational companies sometimes use a complex and expensive process of 'profit-shifting' to take money they've made in higher-taxing countries like Australia to countries like Singapore and The Netherlands where company tax rates are lower. The process is legal, but controversial. Boss gone too Mr Seymour has attempted to minimise the scope of the people involved in the scandal. New documents revealed more people - including him - were aware of the information. (Some may not have been aware of the way in which the information about the new laws came to be in their possession - through Peter-John Collins breaching confidentiality provisions). As of last night, Mr Seymour is no longer CEO. Here's some of the statement. After discussion with the PwC Australia Board of Partners, Tom Seymour is stepping down as CEO, effective immediately. We have appointed our Assurance Leader, Kristin Stubbins, to serve as acting CEO. In the coming months a new CEO will be elected by the Partners. We agreed with Tom that this is in the best interests of the firm and our stakeholders. Given the federal government is the biggest client of PwC and there's currently a Senate hearing into use of consultants by the public service the timing couldn't have been worse.",

Wall Street was lacklustre overnight after Friday's stellar performance thanks to a fall in the US unemployment rate, and Apple's better than expected quarterly earnings. Disappointing company profit reports weighed on the market with drug manufacturer Catalent (-25.7 per cent) tanking after warning of a $US400 million cut to its annual revenue and profit forecasts. Meanwhile, Tyson Foods slumped (-16.4 per cent) after making a loss over the second quarter. The Dow Jones index fell 0.2 per cent, the S & P 500 was flat, while the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.2 per cent. And as Australian investors await tonight's federal budget, the ASX SPI 200 is down 0.1 per cent, indicating a slow start for the local share market. So join me today for all the markets news.",

The ASX 200 index fell 0.2 per cent to 7,264, with nearly all sectors in the red, except the financial index, which eked out a small gain. The Commonwealth Bank (+0.2 per cent) recouped a 1 per cent early loss after delivering a rise in quarterly profit, but warning of a rise in loan losses because of higher interest rates. And the Australian dollar (-0.15 per cent) slipped to 67.72 US cents after weak Chinese trade data. It rose above 68 US cents overnight to a three week high. Chinese imports contracted sharply in April, while exports also slowed. Inbound shipments fell 7.9 per cent over the year, while exports rose 8.5 per cent, easing back from a nearly 15 per cent annual surge in March.",

Treasurer Jim Chalmers says the Petroleum Resource Rent Tax will be increased to bring in an extra $2.4 billion over the next four years. But the government needs the support of Parliament to pass the changes. Independent MP Sophie Scamps wants the tax to be redesigned to raise more money from fossil fuel giants. \"The government's timid changes to our PRRT means that Australians will be continued to be duded when it comes to the sale of our offshore resources and we've got to remember that these resources belong to all Australians and at the moment we are just not benefiting as we should be,\" she said. The PRRT is a 40 per cent tax on the income from offshore projects and has long been criticised for not raising enough money from energy giants. That's because the costs can be deducted and used as tax credits to reduce income tax. Projects that come under the PRRT are not charged royalties or excise. The changes mean that rather than allowing companies to fully deduct their project costs against income, deductions will be capped at 90 per cent. The oil and gas industry has welcomed the planned changes saying that they already pay their fair share of tax. Lobby group, the Australian Petroleum Production & Exploration Association, says the changes get the balance right \"between the undeniable need for a strong gas sector to support reliable electricity and domestic manufacturing for decades to come and the need for a more sustainable national budget\". \"PRRT revenues are already at their highest level ever, forecast to deliver revenue of more than $11 billion over the forward estimates,\" APPEA chief executive Samantha McCulloch said. However, multinational tax expert, Jason Ward, from the Centre for International Corporate Tax Accountability and Research, told me on ABC News Channel that the PRRT needs to be higher.",

Household spending rose 8.2 per cent over the year to March with spending increasing for both goods and services. It rose by nearly 12 per cent in February from a year ago, which was the weakest annual growth since March last year. The March increase was driven by spending on hotels, cafes and restaurants, which saw a 23 per cent increase in spending, and a 16 per cent rise in transport costs. ABS head of business indicators Robert Ewing said inflation was making prices more expensive and therefore increasing spending. \"Rising prices are contributing to this growth,\" he said. \"Services price inflation rose 6.1 per cent - it's largest rise since 2001 - and goods price inflation rose 7.6 per cent (over the year to March).\"",
