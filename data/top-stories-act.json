                "plaintext": "A white Texas gunman who killed 23 people at a Walmart in 2019 after ranting about Hispanics taking over the government and economy has agreed to pay more than $US5 million ($7.7 million) to victims of the racist attack, according to an order signed by a judge Monday. Patrick Crusius was sentenced to 90 consecutive life sentences in July after pleading guilty to federal hate crime charges following one of the nation's worst mass killings. Court records show his attorneys and the Justice Department reached an agreement over the restitution amount, which was then approved by US District Judge David Guaderrama. There is no indication Crusius, 25, has significant assets. He was 21 years old and had dropped out of community college when police say he drove more than 700 miles from his home near Dallas to target Hispanics with an AK-style rifle inside and outside the store. Moments before the attack began, Crusius posted a racist screed online that warned of a Hispanic \"invasion\" of Texas. Crusius pleaded guilty in February after federal prosecutors took the death penalty off the table. But Texas prosecutors have said they will try to put Crusius on death row when he stands trial in state court. That trial date has not yet been set. Under the agreement between the gunman and the government, Crusius will pay $5,557,005.55, according to court filings. The 2019 attack was the deadliest of a dozen mass shootings in the US linked to hate crimes since 2006, according to a database compiled by The Associated Press, USA Today and Northeastern University. Before the shooting, Crusius had appeared consumed by the nation's immigration debate, tweeting #BuildtheWall and other social media posts that praised then-president Donald Trump 's hardline border policies.",

The August 8 wildfire killed at least 97 people and destroyed more than 2,000 buildings, most of them homes. Some survivors jumped over a sea wall and sheltered in the waves as hot black smoke blotted out the sun. Officials have urged residents returning to the area not to sift through the ashes for fear of raising toxic dust. Darryl Oliveira, interim administrator of the Maui Emergency Management Agency, said officials wanted to ensure residents have the space and privacy to reflect or grieve as they see fit. \"They anticipate some people will only want to go for a very short period of time, a few minutes to say goodbye in a way to their property,\" Hawaii Governor Josh Green said last week. \"Others may want to stay several hours. They're going to be very accommodating.\" Those returning were given water, shade, washing stations, portable toilets, medical and mental health care, and transportation assistance if needed. Nonprofit groups also offered personal protective equipment, including masks and coveralls. Officials have warned ash could contain asbestos, lead, arsenic or other toxins.",
