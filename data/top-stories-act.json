Singtel — the company that owns Optus — released its half-yearly results to the Singapore stock exchange today. It says the Australian telco's operating revenue was up by 1 per cent over the six-month period. Optus also added 167,000 new mobile customers in this time. According to Singtel's press release, an increase of 108,000 new prepaid mobile customers was driven by a strong performance by Amaysim — that's a mobile phone provider that operates on the Optus network. A press release posted to Singtel's financial results page features this quote from Optus chief executive Kelly Bayer Rosmarin: \"Our customer-centric approach continues to drive positive engagement. \"We will continue to work to delight customers who are looking for value, innovation and a great network experience.\" However, it's important to note that these figures are based on results for the six months until September 30. So these results don't take into account yesterday's situation.",

It is the highest loss of life in the United Nations in one operation in our history. \"Now, what we've seen through the last month, is more than a humanitarian crisis, it is a catastrophe. \"And for UNFPA, we are deeply concerned for the 1.1 million women and girls in Gaza right now.\" He added that the key message from the UN is wanting a ceasefire, with WHO representative Richard Peeperkorn echoing the calls. Meanwhile, Ms al-Kaila called for \"an immediate stop to the Israeli aggression on the Gaza Strip, and the West Bank\" and for aid to be allowed through. \"Especially fuel, to operate generators in the hospitals, and this should be urgently done and immediately, as well as allowing the access of voluntary medical teams to support the medical teams in treatment of those injured,\" she said \"Allowing the exit of patients and injured residents to get treatment in Egypt hospitals and other countries without any hindrance. \"The cease of displacement of people from their homes, and their neighbourhoods in Gaza. \"All these demands are fair ones, and urgent demands to rescue those who can be rescued in the Gaza Strip.\"",

They understand it's an improvement.\" Mr Hagari added that there would be no ceasefire but Israel has been allowing for humanitarian pauses at specific times to give residents an opportunity to relocate south. Meanwhile, Hamas says its fighters had inflicted heavy losses, with the armed wing on Wednesday releasing a video that appeared to show intense street battles alongside bombed-out buildings in Gaza City. Israeli tanks have met heavy resistance from fighters using underground tunnels to stage ambushes, according to sources with Hamas and the separate Islamic Jihad militant group. One clip from the Hamas video released on Wednesday showed fighters running past piles of debris and stopping to fire shoulder-propelled missiles at Israeli tanks. Another showed them shooting rifles from perches behind buildings and dumpsters. Reuters was not able to authenticate the footage. Saleh al-Arouri, an exiled Hamas commander, told Hamas-affiliated Al-Aqsa TV that Israeli forces may gain control of some areas in Gaza. \"But that will not stop the resistance's fight against soldiers and tanks. The more (Israel) spreads and expands on the ground, the deeper its losses will become\", he said. Reuters",

Construction businesses also saw an increase (+2.6 per cent) driven by heavy and civil engineering construction. The construction industry is up 21.1 per cent from the same time last year as engineering firms continue to work through a large pipeline of infrastructure projects. Manufacturing (-1.3 per cent), professional, scientific and technical services (-0.9 per cent), and arts and recreation services (-0.3 per cent) were the only industries to record falls in turnover.",

The ASX 200 index rose 0.7 per cent to 7,043 by 12:55pm AEDT, its highest level since October 19. The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) lifted key rates to a more than 12-year high on Tuesday but said that going forward it would assess data more closely to decide if even more tightening was required. Analysts at UOB said the RBA's policy guidance in November was \"dovish-sounding\", adding they expect the RBA to keep rates unchanged in December. Banks rose 1.1 per cent, with three of the big four advancing between 1.3 per cent and 2.2 per cent. Westpac was down 1.8 per cent, as it was trading ex-dividend. Mining stocks also surged 0.6% tracking higher iron ore prices, after the central bank governor in top steel producer China spoke on ongoing support measures for the property market. Rio Tinto rose 0.8 per cent, while BHP added 0.7 per cent. Technology stocks slumped 2.9 per cent, becoming the biggest percentage losers on the benchmark. The sub-index was set for biggest drop in two weeks. Heavyweight Xero's shares fell as much as 9 per cent, as the software firm's half-year core profit missed analyst expectations. Wisetech Global shed 0.8 per cent, while shares of Block gained 2.8 per cent. Gold stocks also slipped 1.8 per cent following a drop in gold prices. Evolution Mining and Northern Star Resources fell 1.1 per cent and 0.4 per cent, respectively.",
