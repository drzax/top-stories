Speaking to business presenter Rachel Pupazzoni about Dr Lowe's performance, former RBA economist and monetary policy lecturer at Monash University Zac Gross says Dr Lower will be primarily remembered as a \" crisis fighter \" and he's done a good job at holding the economy together during the pandemic. However, Mr Gross says the RBA will be reflecting upon Dr Lowe's forward guidance on rates for a long time. Mr Gross also thinks that the priority for the incoming governor is to make sure inflation gets back to the target band, which is 2-3 per cent.
