The lawsuit also argues the ban is pre-empted by federal law because it intrudes upon matters of federal concern. TikTok also argues Montana is trying to \"banish\" the app \"based on speculative concerns about TikTok's data security and content moderation practices\". Former US president Donald Trump tried to bar new downloads of TikTok and Chinese-owned WeChat and other transactions in 2020, which the companies said would have effectively barred use of the apps, but a series of court decisions blocked the bans from taking effect.",

Kohberger declined to enter pleas with his attorney telling the judge they would \"stand silent\" at this time. The judge entered not guilty pleas on Kohberger's behalf.
