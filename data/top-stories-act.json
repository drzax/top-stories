The error resulted in customers being charged with thousands of dollars in fees while the average remediation paid was around $45 per affected account, according to the Australian Securities & Investments Commission (ASIC) â the regulator which sued ANZ. \"Many ANZ customers relied on the account information displayed by the bank and were charged fees that were inconsistent with that information,\" said ASIC deputy chair Sarah Court.
