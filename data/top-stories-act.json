Stephen Richardson from the Tasmania Fire Service says patrols are continuing. \"We still have to continue to monitor the fire in and around those properties because there's not enough rain to extinguish the fire at this point,\" he says.

Several major indexes posted their biggest quarterly (and monthly) losses all year: So what's causing investors to get spooked? One factor is the comments that central bank officials, worldwide have made about the interest rate outlook. Earlier today, Federal Reserve vice-chair for supervision Michael Barr said he feels US rates are \"at or near\" a level that is sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation down to the Fed's 2% target. It is also likely, he told the Forecasters Club of New York, that rates will need to stay high for some time to bring inflation down to target, and he is confident the Fed will get that job done. Senior officials from the US, European, British and Australian central banks have recently made similar statements (reiterating that the next move on rates is \"data dependent\"), which aren't exactly groundbreaking. Investors are now beginning to take them more seriously, and are re-thinking their earlier expectations about rate cuts happening soon. Bond sell-off, stronger US greenback, weaker share markets So the \"higher for longer\" narrative has caused a sell-off in the government bond (or debt) market, which has pushed the US 10-year Treasury yield to its highest level in 16 years (around the time of the Global Financial Crisis). As the price of bonds fall, their yields go up (the price and yield move in opposite directions). It means the US government would need to pay higher interest, to entice more people to lend it money (by purchasing its Treasurey bonds). And that boosted the US dollar to its highest level since November last year (and weakened other currencies, like the Australian dollar, in the process). As more investors invest in the 'safe' greenback, they're pulling their money out of riskier assets (like the share market), which is why the ASX 200, S & P 500, Stoxx 600, Nikkei and other indexes suffered their worst quarters of the year.",
