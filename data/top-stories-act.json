              "plaintext": "Some other profit results out today: Logistics software company WiseTech Global saw net profit for 2023 rise by 9 per cent to $212 million. Its shares plunged because investors are disappointed by its forecast for 2024 earnings. Engineering firm Worley Parsons saw annual profit fall by 78 per cent to $37 million after a $240 million loss on the sale of a North American maintenance business. IDP Education says net profit rose 45 per cent to $148.5 million for the year as student placement revenue increased to nearly $982 million as the international student market rebounded from COVID globally. Business travel management provider Corporate Travel Management says 2023 net profit rose from $3.2 million in 2022 to $77.6 million as revenue surged by 70 per cent as it gained new clients. But one of those clients is the United Kingdom, which is controversially paying CTM $3 billion to provide temporary housing for asylum seekers including on a barge in Dorset. \"In April 2023, CTM was awarded its largest customer contract, to manage the accommodation needs of asylum seekers in the United Kingdom.\" \"It is expected to contribute significantly to the Europe region's results in future years.\"",
