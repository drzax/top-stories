Our population grew by 2.2 per cent to 26.5 million people in the 12 months to 31 March this year. Beidar Cho, ABS head of demography, said: \"13 months after international borders were re-opened, net overseas migration accounted for 81 per cent of growth and added 454,400 people to the population in the year to March 2023.\" Net overseas migration was driven by a large increase in a rrivals (681,000 people) and only a small increase in overseas migrant departures (226,600 people). But the ABS thinks this pattern will be temporary, saying the number of departures will increase as temporary students start departing in usual numbers. Natural increase was 108,800 people, but that's a decrease of 18.5 per cent from last year. There were 301,200 births and 192,300 deaths registered during this time, with deaths increasing 7.9 per cent and births decreasing 3.4 per cent. Western Australia is the fastest growing state (+2.8 per cent) followed by Victoria (+2.4 per cent) and Queensland (+2.3 per cent). The largest increase in total population was Victoria with 161,700 people, slightly more than New South Wales with 156,300 people.",

US headline CPI rose 0.6 per cent in August, taking the annual rate to 3.7 per cent. Westpac's Head of International Economics, Elliot Clarke thinks that rate is enough for chairman Jerome Powell the the rest of the board to hold steady - and stay there long term. Here are some thoughts from his note today: \"Westpac remains of the view that the rate hike cycle is complete and that the first cut will most likely come in March 2024.\" At 3.7%yr in August 2023, annual headline inflation is now less than half its June 2022 peak of 9.1%yr. He thinks inflation will start to lift again in late-2024 into 202. \"With the unwinding of the pandemic supply chain shock over and the US re-shoring some of its global production chain, goods inflation is likely to begin to lift once again.\" The US Federal Reserve meets on September 19 and 20.",
