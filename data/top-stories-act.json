The nine-metre boat was on its way from Vanuatu to Cairns when both hulls were damaged in several shark attacks. The group activated an emergency beacon at 1:30am, and the Australian Maritime Safety Authority requested the assistance of a nearby vehicle carrier along with the Cairns-based Challenger Rescue Aircraft. The vehicle carrier, Dugong Ace, collected the group. They are due to arrive in Brisbane on Thursday.",

I won't hit you with them all at once, but here's the first few that mention some terms you'll be familiar with: Inflation continued to moderate. The consumer price index rose 0.8 per cent in the June quarter and was up 6.0 per cent in the past 12 months. This marked the second consecutive quarter of lower annual inflation, down from the peak of 7.8 per cent in the December 2022 quarter. Food prices increased 1.6 per cent during the quarter, and housing costs as measured in the CPI rose 0.8 per cent. Higher interest rates squeezed consumption. Households shelled out $82.8 billion in mortgage interest payable during the year. This was almost double last year’s interest bill. Discretionary household spending fell 0.5 per cent in the June quarter, which was the third quarterly fall in a row. Spending on furnishings and household equipment fell for the fifth quarter in succession, down 3.4 per cent in annual terms. Retail sales fell 0.5 per cent during the quarter, and retail inventories fell sharply. We worked more hours. We spent 2.4 per cent more time at work than we did last quarter, which, excluding the COVID-19 pandemic, was the fastest quarterly increase in hours worked on record. We worked 6.8 per cent more hours this year than last year, and with GDP rising by a smaller amount, labour productivity fell 3.2 per cent in annual terms.",

The new scheme will deliver a $2.7 billion dollar boost to the budget over four years.
