              "plaintext": "The Israeli military appears to have walked back an earlier claim that soldiers had found \"a guardian list\" suggesting Hamas fighters held Israeli hostages prisoner in the basement of a Gaza children's hospital. The video, which the IDF said was shot in the basement of Gaza's Rantisi Hospital, shows IDF spokesperson Daniel Hagari walking around the room describing different elements that show \"signs that indicate that Hamas held hostages here\". One of the items Hagari points to is a sheet of paper on a wall. He says: \"There is a list. This list in Arabic, in Arabic this list says we are in operation, the operation against Israel. Started in the 7th of October. \"This is a guardian list, where every terrorist writes his name and every terrorist has his own shift, guarding the people the people that were here.\" However, what that page depicts is a calendar with days and dates starting on Saturday October 7, when Hamas launched its surprise attack against Israel. The Arabic text above the numbers spells out the names of the days. There do not appear to be any personal names on the sheet. The text at the top reads \"The Aqsa flood battle\", the name which Hamas gave its attack. The days up to and including Friday November 3 have been marked out in yellow highlighter. In a later media briefing Hagari playing back some parts of the video, amended his language and correctly identified what the page said. \"There is this list with days, mark the days from the 7th of October and has the name that Hamas gave to the operation, 'Operation of Al-Aqsa' (Flood), of the mosque of Al-Aqsa. \"Has the dates, the number of the days that followed by, I don't know exactly what it indicates, when did they left this area but you have to remember, we evacuate the hospital with the patients. \"They might have left with the patients, they might have run away through tunnels, and we have signs that they had hostages with them. It's still under investigation but there's enough signs to indicate that.\" In the basement he also showed weapons including grenades, suicide vests and other explosives as well as a motorcycle with gunshot marks which he said appeared to have been used to bring hostages to Gaza after the attack. He also showed footage of what appeared to be rudimentary living quarters, including a small kitchen, as well as a nearby underground tunnel which he said led to the house of a senior Hamas naval commander. The ABC could not verify when or where this footage was taken. Israel has repeatedly accused Hamas of using hospitals and other civilian infrastructure to hide command centres and weapons positions, claims which Hamas and hospital authorities in Gaza have denied. Rantisi Hospital is a paediatric hospital which specialises in treating cancer patients.",

The five Palestinian men, aged 21 to 29, were killed during an operation in the city by the Israeli Army, said Amin Khader, head of the Thabet hospital, where the deaths were recorded. Witnesses reported violent confrontations in the area and a massive deployment of Israeli soldiers seeking to make arrests. The Palestinians' official news agency WAFA reported three were killed in a drone strike while the other two were shot. The Israeli Army confirmed to AFP that an operation had taken place in the same part of the occupied West Bank, but it did not give a reason or comment on any Palestinian casualties. On Thursday, the Palestinian health ministry said that 14 people were killed in an Israeli operation in the city of Jenin — the highest West Bank death toll from a single raid since at least 2005, according to United Nations records. At least 180 Palestinians and three Israelis have been killed across the West Bank since October 7, according to officials on both sides. Israeli forces have also since arrested more than 2,000 people across the West Bank and annexed east Jerusalem, according to the Palestinian Prisoners' Club advocacy group. The Israeli military has put the arrest figure for the West Bank only at more than 1,400, and has claimed most were affiliated with Hamas. Israel regularly launches raids across the Palestinian territory it has occupied since 1967. AFP/Reuters",
