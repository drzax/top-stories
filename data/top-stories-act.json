Keanu Vicente lives in Israel but says he fled from Tel Aviv to Nazareth in the north of the country to avoid the shelling. \"I was on the phone to the emergency Australian consular assistance today just asking them for any updates, at the time I called they told me they didn't have any plans for repatriation flights,\" he says. \"The last 12 hours today, it's just been very tense with a lot of bad news pouring in from down south. \"A lot of our friends and family lost a lot of people.\" He says he hid in bomb shelters in Tel Aviv on the day bombing broke out. \"We woke up to the bombs and were hiding in the bomb shelters all day there,\" Mr Vicente says. He says many friends have been called into Israel's reserve forces in response to the conflict. \"So that brings about a new sense of worry,\" he says.",

Campaigners outside told us that some voters were unsure about their choice while others walked in with a clear decision in mind. Voters and campaigners alike said finding accurate information wasn't easy and misinformation and disinformation was visible on social media platforms. So, we asked a few young voters about their choice and how they arrived at their decision: Max, Electrician apprentice \"I voted 'no'. I've heard so many things and apparently, it's going to divide the country,\" he said. Max says amongst his friends who are Indigenous, their views on the referendum are split. \"A lot of them have said 'no' but I've also got others that said 'yes',\" he said. Not knowing a lot about it, I'm just going to stay out of it and vote 'no'.\" Laila, UTS student \"I'm going to vote 'yes'. I feel like we got a lot of information, some of it false, some of it true,\" she said. Laila says before the referendum, she assumed First Nations people already had a voice on matters that impacted them. \"It's just about giving everyone a chance to have their say in a country that is more rightfully theirs, than ours anyway,\" she said.",

It follows fellow sports star, Panthers NRL Premiership hero Nathan Cleary also announcing his support for a First Nations Voice to Parliament. A week after winning the AFL Premiership, Darcy Moore told RN Breakfast host Patricia Karvelas that despite what some people thought, sport and politics could mix. \"I'll be voting yes. To me, I feel like it's an intuitive next step and seems to be an important and practical way to help Indigenous Australians,\" he said. \"There are certainly people out there that want you to shut up and play sport, but we've seen all around the country, like with Nathan Cleary, athletes are human beings and citizens of the country too, so they can exercise their right and say what they want to say and they can do it in a really healthy way. \"The argument around division … to my mind there is already advisory bodies for Indigenous Australians that have come and gone as governments have changed. The mechanism has kind of already existed anyway, so by making it sort of permanent in the constitution, it's just locking it in. So in that way it's not anything new.\" Listen to the full interview below.",

Yesterday the committee released its final report, making 10 recommendations — including that th e committee receive evidence from witnesses who weren't available to attend previous public hearings, specifically naming former Qantas boss Alan Joyce. Senator McKenzie was on News Breakfast this morning discussing the report, and said Mr Joyce will be required to give evidence to get to the bottom of the federal government's decision to block the extra Qatar flights. \"We know that [Transport Minister Catherine King] was of a mind to approve that negotiating mandate [with Qatar Airways] in January … but then suddenly it goes quiet. She doesn't approve it, and for six months, that sits on her desk ,\" Senator McKenzie said. \"A week after the prime minister agrees to launch the Yes campaign with Alan Joyce in August, one week after that diary entry was made, she rejects the decision. None of that was known prior to this inquiry. \"That is why one of the other recommendations is that the Senate agrees that when Mr Joyce arrives back in Australia, he will appear before this committee and give us the key evidence that has been hidden from us thus far, because the minister has gagged her department, as has the prime minister gagged his.\" Senator McKenzie said the Senate will vote next week to request Mr Joyce's attendance before the committee. \"All the evidence received by this inquiry suggests there's only three people that know the real answer to this: the [transport] minster, the prime minister, and Mr Joyce ,\" she said. \"If he won't agree to appear, we have the power to summons him, which the committee has already decided it will do because Mr Joyce, despite no longer being the CEO, was the figure, because of his close personal and political relationship with the prime minster, was the person that we believe intervened and influenced Minister King's change of mind between January and July. \" Without his evidence, we won't be able to get to the bottom of it. \" Mr Joyce is currently overseas, and it is not yet known when he will return to Australia.",
