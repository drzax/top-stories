Fuel was by far the biggest factor, but there's plenty more at play that are contributing to the increase — so let's break them down. What were the most significant contributors? Fuel prices, up 7.2% (The highest quarterly rise since March 2022) Electricity, up 4.2% Insurance, up 2.3% Rents, up 2.2% (Annual rental prices rose 7.6%, the largest increase since 2009) New house purchases, up 1.3% What was behind their increases? Fuel: Higher global oil prices Electricity: Higher wholesale prices being passed onto customers since July, partially offset by Energy Bill Relief rebates from July Insurance: Higher premiums for house, house contents and motor vehicle insurance Rents: Low vacancy rates, but moderated by increases in Commonwealth Rent Assistance New house purchases: Builders passing on labour and material costs Were there any falls? Yes — there were offsets during the September quarter for child care, fruit and vegetables, and domestic holiday travel and accommodation Child care fell 13.2%, after changes to the Child Care Subsidy increased the amount received by over a million families in July Fruit and vegetables saw price falls of 3.7% because of favourable growing conditions Domestic holiday travel and accommodation fell 2.5% as there were no school holidays in August, reducing demand for airfares and accommodation It's also worth pointing out that the ABS says those significant contributors to inflation could have seen even higher increases had there not been support measures in place. The ABS's head of price statistics, Michelle Marquardt, says the rent assistance reduced the overall rent increases by 0.3%, while electricity prices would have increased 18.6% in the September quarter without the Energy Bill Relief rebates. Similarly, child care prices would have increased 6.7% without the Child Care Subsidy reducing out of pocket costs for households.",

Ms Mousina still expects some prices will continue to come down in the coming months, and says \"we will be surprised at how far inflation can fall\" next year as Australia braces for softer economic growth.

Speaking in Canberra about the figures, Mr Chalmers said the 1.2% September increase was consistent with Treasury forecasts, but warned further volatility in inflation is likely in coming months in response to oil markets and fuel prices. \"Production cuts and disruptions in global oil markets are a key driver of inflation in the global economy and here at home, with Australians facing higher fuel prices at the bowser,\" he said. \"Petrol prices increased 7.2% in the [September] quarter, contributing a quarter of a percentage point to quarterly inflation. \"We shouldn't be surprised to see some volatility in inflation figures going forward, particularly given the global uncertainty from the conflict in the Middle East and the war in Ukraine. \"We understand that inflation and higher interest rates that are already in the system are biting households hard and we're acting to make things a little easier.\"",
