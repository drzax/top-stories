The entrances of several Victorian Labor MPs in Melbourne were blocked with fake bodies in body bags this morning. The protest material was removed within hours. Fifteen body bags were laid outside each office, which the group says equates to the number of Palestinian deaths per hour in Gaza. Deputy Prime Minister Richard Marles said he was aware that his Geelong office had been targeted. \"My first concern is always for the safety and wellbeing of my staff,\" he said in a statement. The offices of Bill Shorten, Ged Kearney and Peter Khalil were also among those targeted. The group is calling on the Labor government to immediately cut all diplomatic and economic support of Israel, end arms supplies and is demanding an immediate ceasefire. One of the organisers, who asked to be only named as Linda, said the small group of about 10 protesters were parents and healthcare workers motivated by their horror at civilian deaths in Gaza. She said she apologised to anyone who was saddened or disturbed by this morning's action. \"I can really appreciate that people found it jarring and disturbing,\" she said. \"I found it disturbing preparing for the action, but is there anything more harrowing than a dead child? This is the reality, in real life, for the people in Gaza.\" She said the group felt this was the only way to get through to politicians after failed petitions and letters that had no response. Mr Shorten's office declined to comment. The ABC is contacting other MPs whose offices were targeted. Victoria Police has confirmed it is investigating the incidents.",

Base wages rose 1.3 per cent over the three months to September and 4 per cent over the past year. Wages were pushed higher by a 5.75 per cent boost for workers on awards and a 15 per cent pay jump for many aged care workers from July 1. Economists say the one-offs shouldn't be extrapolated. EY chief economist Cherelle Murphy explains in a note on why the real test on wages will come next quarter. \"This strong result is not out of line with the Reserve Bank’s expectations that the WPI will peak at 4 per cent at the end of this year. But the real test will come next quarter and in 2024,\" she said. \"The Reserve Bank expects wages growth will slow in line with the slight easing of labour demand indicators as productivity growth recovers. The bank’s business liaison program has also reported a larger share of firms expecting wages growth in a years’ time will be below its current rate. \"Today's result alone will not convince the Reserve Bank that another rate hike is needed at its December Board meeting – given the increase in wages this quarter was within their expectations. The risks are tilted towards another rate hike in the new year – given the labour market remains tight and medium-term inflation expectations have ticked up a little. The impact on inflation from these risks will be worse if productivity outcomes remain poor.\"",

              "plaintext": "The push to legalise cannabis for recreational use in Australia just got another boost from a former AFP chief commissioner. At a speech in Melbourne, Mick Palmer AO said cannabis law reform would lead to less discrimination and spending on enforcement. The retired police officer spent many years in the field, including in the Northern Territory, where he says he saw many examples of Indigenous Australians being discriminated against, under laws that once banned them from drinking alcohol. He reminded people listening in the crowd that homosexual acts and suicide had also once been illegal. \"Police, too often, in my view, are seen as a ‘cure all’,\" he said. \"The cadre of people most in need of support, treatment and protection are those most likely to be punished. \"There has to be a better, more effective, less damaging way to deal with people who use cannabis, than simply arresting them.\" Palmer was sworn is as the top police officer in the country in 1994 and, during his reign as AFP commissioner, conducted the Palmer Inquiry into the unlawful detention of Australian citizen, Cornelia Rau. He made this speech for one of Australia's most renowned authorities on drug reform. The Penington Institute recently changed its position on cannabis legalisation, and now argues that it should be made lawful in \"a strictly regulated market that prioritises safety and health outcomes\". \"On the basis of long and painful legislative history lessons, it is a position that is hard to argue against,\" Mr Palmer said. \"To do so I suggest, would go a long way towards leaving a truly courageous legacy.\" The former AFP commissioner's comments come just days after ABC News published a story into the growing push to nationally legalise Australia's most commonly consumed illicit substance. The Greens say legalisation could lead to an economic boom, and medicinal marijuana companies agree, although they are in dispute with the Greens about the best way to achieve this.",
