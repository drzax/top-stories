Fitch says the downgrade reflects the expected fiscal deterioration over the next three years, a high and growing general government debt burden, and the erosion of governance. In May, Fitch threatened to cut the AAA credit rating because of the US debt ceiling standoff. \"In Fitch's view, there has been steady deterioration in standards of governance over the last 20 years, including on fiscal and debt matters, notwithstanding the June bipartisan agreement to suspend the debt limit until January 2025.\" \"The repeated debt limit political standoffs and last minute resolutions have eroded confidence in fiscal management.\" Fitch is also predicting a mild recession for the US economy later this year and early next year because of high interest rates, weakening business investment and a slowdown in spending. It expects the Federal Reserve to lift interest rates one more time to 5.5 per cent to 5.75 per cent by next month. Standard and Poor's downgraded the US credit rating from the top AAA rating in 2011 after the US managed to avoid a debt default. Moody's Investors Service has maintained the US credit rating at AAA. Credit ratings are used by investors to assess a country or company's ability to repay their debts. The reality is a AA+ credit rating is still very high and won't have much impact on the borrowing costs of the US. But not every one agrees with Fitch's decision including former Treasury secretary Larry Summers.",

The Australian dollar slumped by 1.6 per cent overnight after the Reserve Bank left official interest rates on hold at 4.1 per cent. US stocks were mixed with the Dow Jones index modestly rising, but the S & P 500 and Nasdaq lost ground. That's ahead of major company profit results this week and the latest US employment data. New data showed the US manufacturing industry contracted in July but at a slower pace than in June, which was the lowest reading since May 2020. It was the ninth month of contraction for the Institute of Supply Management's manufacturing index. There was a gradual improvement in new orders, but factory employment dropped to a three-year low. Other surveys showed manufacturing contracting globally including in Germany, France, the United Kingdom and China. Grab a coffee and let's go.",
