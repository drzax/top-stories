                "plaintext": "Good morning! It's David Chau here, with a guest blog post on the latest developments in China's beleaguered property sector. The chairman of China Evergrande has reportedly been put under police surveillance, while the embattled company's shares were suspended from trading on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange (HKSE). Hui Ka Yan was taken away earlier this month and is being monitored at a designated location, Bloomberg reported. At this stage, it is unclear why Hui was placed under residential surveillance — a measure which falls short of a formal detention or arrest. Earlier this month, several employees of Evergrande’s wealth management unit were arrested in Shenzhen on unspecified charges. Evergrande is the world's most heavily indebted property developer, with around $US300 billion in total liabilities. Most of its debt is owed to people within China, many of whom are ordinary citizens whose off-the-plan apartments have not been finished. At its peak, Evergrande was the top-selling Chinese property developer, but now finds itself at the centre of China's property crisis. It has supposedly been on the brink of collapse for the past two years. Since then, a long list of property firms have been revealed to be in financial difficulty — struggling to pay off their debts — including Country Garden. Adding to the list of its woes, Evergrande's mainland unit Hengda Real Estate has defaulted on 4 billion yuan ($860 million) worth of debt. On Sunday, Evergrande told the HKSE that it was unable to sell new debt as part of its restructuring plan because Hengda was under investigation by authorities. Shares of Evergrande have plunged 38.5% to 32 Hong Kong cents over the past week. Looking further back, its share price has plummeted 98.5% in the past five years (from a high of roughly $HK22). In other words, the company's shares are almost worthless as fresh doubts emerge about its future, and whether China's government is now prepared to allow Evergrande to collapse. If so, it would likely have a significant impact on China's property prices (and social stability) since the property sector makes up around 25% of its economy.",

Its statutory net profit after tax (which includes significant items from discontinued operations) was down 54%, from $854 million to $395 million. The company declared a final dividend of 42 Australian cents per share. For its Building Products Australia division, earnings before interest and depreciation was $100 million for the year, down 13%. Brickworks managing director Lindsay Partridge said: \"Despite a significant decrease in new residential construction projects being commenced, demand was resilient throughout the year, with a large backlog of work under construction. \"However, our margins decreased as a result of cost pressures across the supply chain. Across Austral Bricks, unit electricity costs were up 28% year on year, labour was up 13% and maintenance was up 12%. \"Fortunately, our brick operations are protected from raw material input cost increases, through our direct ownership of clay quarries. \"In our Concrete Products and Bristile Roofing businesses, where we source raw materials such as sand and cement from external suppliers, our unit raw materials costs were up by around 20%.\" Share price this morning:",
