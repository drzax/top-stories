Analysts at RBC Capital Markets expect iron ore prices could fall back to $US75-80 a tonne, although they expect this is largely priced in by the major miners. Technology was the worst performing sector of the session, which is saying something, as all sectors fell except real estate investment trusts, which gained just 0.05 per cent. Concerns about China's economic outlook also weighed on the Australian dollar, which sank to fresh nine month lows below 64.3 US cents mid-morning.",

Office and industrial property owner and manager Dexus has reported a $752.7 million loss for the financial year just ended, down from a $1.6 billion profit in 2022. A writedown in office values amid rising interest rates and the continued preference of many staff to work from home drove the deterioration. Excluding the writedowns, funds from operations fell a smaller 2.5% to $738.5 million. Saranga Ranasinghe, a vice-president at Moody's Investors Service, noted that, despite the loss, the result was a credit positive for Dexus. \"The results highlight the resilience of Dexus' good-quality portfolio of assets across office and industrial, despite a challenging environment,\" he wrote. \"Dexus has increased its office occupancy levels to 95.9%, well above the market average, with the portfolio benefiting from a flight to quality. Despite office leasing incentives in all capital markets remaining elevated, Dexus recorded a 5.6% increase in effective like-for-like income in its office portfolio.\" Shopping centre operator Vicinity reported a 77.7% drop in net profit to $271.5 million, while its funds from operations rose 14.5% to $684.8 million. The drop in its net profit was driven by negative revaluations of its shopping centre portfolio, under the impact of higher interest rates and with pressure growing on the retail sector. Mr Ranasinghe also viewed Vicinity's result as positive, but noted that it might face tougher times ahead. \"Vicinity increased its occupancy levels during the period to 98.8% and achieved positive leasing spreads, highlighting the strength of its portfolio of high-quality retail assets. \"Despite consumers facing cost-of-living pressures, Australia's retail sector has remained resilient given strong employment and consumers' savings buffers. Still, we expect high interest rates to soften consumer demand for discretionary retail over the next 12 months. \"Vicinity benefits from its strong portfolio with favourable lease structures, a robust balance sheet and ample liquidity, which will likely provide a buffer against material downside risk to its credit profile stemming from weaker retail sales and general macroeconomic headwinds.\"",

              "plaintext": "Shares in Endeavour Group are down about 4 per cent after the drinks and hotel business reported its full-year results. The company behind Dan Murphy's, BWS and ALH Hotels posted a 6.9 per cent rise in net profit, to $529 million, which was below analyst expectations. While Australians have returned to the pub post-pandemic, the group's alcohol stores saw sales and earnings edge lower. Endeavour says that is coming off the back of particularly strong sales during the prior year due to restrictions, however. Phillip Kimber, retail analyst at E & P Capital, observed that in the second half of the financial year, the retail side of the business improved while hotel earnings pulled back. \"Whilst not immune to shifts in consumer sentiment and economic conditions, trading has been resilient across the final quarter… and in the first six weeks of the new financial year,\" Endeavour said of its retail business. Meanwhile, it's hoping its hotels will hold up despite the cost-of-living pressures on households due to its positioning as \"an affordable destination\". It comes as the hospitality industry is feeling pressure from the rising costs hitting customers and suppliers.
