Elderly grandmother Shosh Edelshtein says she came to visit her grandsons, and \"run away from the bombs\". \"Here is quiet,\" she told a reporter at Sydney airport. While she resides in the north of Israel, away from the border near Gaza, she said it was still \"not quiet\" where she had been living. \"People love to fight,\" she says, agreeing that she had fled a scary situation. Schlomo Diveroni, along with many others who had been repatriated back to Australia from Israel, expressed immense gratitude for the Australian government. \"It's exceptional what they did,\" he told a reporter at Sydney airport. From the free and expedited flight, courtesy buses, accommodation and food, Mr Schlomo says he appreciated being safe and well after the family tragedy he left behind in Israel. A family member had been \"murdered\" in the fighting, he says, while three of his daughters chose to remain behind. \"They are on razor's edge constantly under threat, missiles coming through, you have to run to shelters, it's a precarious situation over there.\"",
