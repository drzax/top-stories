She says a low pressure system will start to develop tomorrow which will bring more wet weather. \"There is quite a lot of rainfall expected to fall over 6 to 12 hours,\"Johnson says. \"So even if it's not that heavy rainfall where you get a huge amount in a short time, it could still be enough to overwhelm gutters and give some flash flooding.\" Conditions are expected to be much clearer on Friday and into the weekend.",

Once you start thinking about alternative ways of managing inflation (that depend on the type of inflation you want to fix), the current way of doing things seems really unsophisticated. Philip Lowe said so himself, in recent weeks. This is what he said in September (last month!): \"My view has long been that if we were designing optimal policy arrangements from scratch, monetary and fiscal policy would both have a role in managing the economic cycle and inflation, and there would be close coordination. \"In principle, fiscal policy could provide a stronger helping hand, although this would require some rethinking of the existing policy architecture. \"In particular, it would require making some fiscal instruments more nimble, strengthening the (semi) automatic stabilisers and giving an independent body limited control over some fiscal instruments. \"I've noticed that people like Olivier Blanchard, who taught me when I was at MIT and then was chief economist at the IMF, he's recently been talking about fiscal policy being used in this way through the creation of some semi-automatic stabilisers, [where] some of the fiscal parameters get adjusted almost mechanically, or that you give an independent body, not the Reserve Bank, but some other independent body, the authority to adjust fiscal instruments within a certain range. \"So that's quite a different institutional set-up from the one we have now. \"It may not be better than what we have now, but given the limitations of monetary policy ... you know, what we're doing affects people very unevenly, I think we should aspire to kind of something better. \"Exploring some of these ideas might be the right way, [or] they may not be,\" he said. In that imagined scenario of his, I don't see why there couldn't be an opportunity to start manipulating the superannuation guarantee to control certain types of inflation.",
