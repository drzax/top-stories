It's been a good night on Wall Street as investors hope the Federal Reserve will keep interest rates on hold this week at 5 to 5.25 per cent. The S & P 500 and the Nasdaq closed at the highest since April last year, with the benchmark index in a bull market. The S & P 500 is up by 21 per cent from its low in October last year. Tech heavyweights drove the market and software firm Oracle hit a record high ahead of its quarterly results. Consumer prices are predicted to have cooled in May and traders see a 76 per cent chance the Fed will pause its rate hikes this week. Grab some coffee and let's go.",
