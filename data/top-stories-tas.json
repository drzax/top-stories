But this is not the first time Israel has said that. They previously said Hamas used underground areas in Al-Shifa during a 2008-2009 war, according to Reuters. That war saw more than 1,400 Palestinians and 13 Israelis killed. It was not possible to verify the claims at the time, Reuters says. The New York Times says one of their journalists in 2008 watched armed Hamas militants walking around Al-Shifa Hospital in civilian clothes. Amnesty Internationa l concluded in the 2014 conflict that Hamas used parts of Al-Shifa \"to detain, interrogate, torture and otherwise ill-treat suspects, even as other parts of the hospital continued to function as a medical center\".",

The entrances of several Victorian Labor MPs in Melbourne were blocked with fake bodies in body bags this morning. The protest material was removed within hours. Fifteen body bags were laid outside each office, which the group says equates to the number of Palestinian deaths per hour in Gaza. Deputy Prime Minister Richard Marles said he was aware that his Geelong office had been targeted. \"My first concern is always for the safety and wellbeing of my staff,\" he said in a statement. The offices of Bill Shorten, Ged Kearney and Peter Khalil were also among those targeted. The group is calling on the Labor government to immediately cut all diplomatic and economic support of Israel, end arms supplies and is demanding an immediate ceasefire. One of the organisers, who asked to be only named as Linda, said the small group of about 10 protesters were parents and healthcare workers motivated by their horror at civilian deaths in Gaza. She said she apologised to anyone who was saddened or disturbed by this morning's action. \"I can really appreciate that people found it jarring and disturbing,\" she said. \"I found it disturbing preparing for the action, but is there anything more harrowing than a dead child? This is the reality, in real life, for the people in Gaza.\" She said the group felt this was the only way to get through to politicians after failed petitions and letters that had no response. Mr Shorten's office declined to comment. The ABC is contacting other MPs whose offices were targeted. Victoria Police has confirmed it is investigating the incidents.",
