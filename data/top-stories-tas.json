While the ASX 200 is off 0.2% at 7,244 points and the All Ords down a similar amount at 7,439, much of the decline is down to ANZ and Macquarie. Both banks are ex-dividend today, which means anyone who buys their shares from today on won't get their most recent shareholder distributions. That's an 81-cent half-year dividend for ANZ and a $4.50 per share payment for Macquarie shareholders. That's the main reason ANZ's shares are down $1.06, or 4.3%, to $23.44, while Macquarie's are off 3%, or $5.33, to $173.75. The banking sector as a whole is a little on the nose, amid ongoing concerns about the crisis for many US regional banks, as well as more general worries about credit quality and earnings for banks with interest rates higher than they've been for more than a decade. The financial sector on the ASX 200 was down 1.2 per cent in the first 25 minutes of trade, with industrials, education and technology also stuck well in the red. On the flip side, mining and energy are having good mornings, with basic materials up 0.9 per cent.",

The US equivalent of the Westpac-Melbourne Institute consumer sentiment survey here showed that many Americans expect price increases to remain higher for longer. \"Bond, currency and equity market were all spooked on Friday by the reported rise in the 5-10 year inflation expectations component of the University of Michigan's preliminary May Consumer Sentiment survey,\" noted NAB's head of FX strategy Ray Attrill. \"It rose to 3.2% from 2.9% against an expected 3%, its highest reading since March 2011 (also 3.2%) and previously higher (3.4%) as far back as mid-2008 just prior to the GFC. \"No matter that Consumer Sentiment itself slumped to 57.7 from 63.5, well below expectations. \"The release sparked a 10 basis point jump in front-end US bond yields, a 0.5% rally in the DXY dollar index and near 1% fall in the S & P 500 (about half of which was subsequently retraced). \"In the US money market, the release has sown a few seeds of doubts regarding confidence the Fed will pass on another rate rise next month, June Fed Funds pricing finishing Friday ascribing a 13% chance to another 25 basis point hike, up from less than 3% on Thursday.\" So consumers expect higher inflation, which could mean even higher interest rates. On the other hand, the performance of smaller companies (small caps) on the US share market has some analysts sharpening their predictions of a US recession within the next year. This from Lewis Krauskopf at Reuters : The small-cap Russell 2000 is down about 1% this year, compared to a rally that has boosted the S & P 500, an index representing the largest US companies, 7% year-to-date. Like the inverted U.S. Treasury yield curve and strength in gold prices, the weakness in shares of smaller companies — which tend to derive profits domestically and be more vulnerable to economic shifts than larger firms — is one of several signs that investors are uneasy about the economic outlook. Small cap stocks have struggled since turmoil in US regional banks erupted in early March, with the Russell 2000 down 7% since March 8. Investors fear that smaller firms will be hit hard by a potential lending slowdown that could weigh on the broader economy. Investors are \"trying to position their portfolios for what they think is going to happen in the economy,\" said Eric Kuby, chief investment officer at North Star Investment Management, which specializes in small caps. \"Small caps being out of favor is another signal that investors are bracing themselves for an impending recession.\" Small caps have tended to waver ahead of economic weakness in the past. Since 1980, the Russell 2000 has lagged the S & P 500 by an average of about four percentage points in the six months after the economic cycle has peaked, ahead of a recession, according to Strategas data. Economic data has so far shown few signs of a sharp drop-off in growth, though inflation and some other important metrics have cooled. Still, some market participants believe the Fed's 500 basis points of rate increases over the past year are only starting to impact the economy. \"We are likely headed into a recession sometime in the next 12 months,\" said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors. \"Typically in a recession, small caps underperform.\" So will the US have a recession, persistent inflation, or could it be both, in a phenomenon known as \"stagflation\"? My colleague Gareth Hutchens wrote some great pieces about this topic last year:",
