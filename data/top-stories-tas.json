All the talk before the game was about how the Football Ferns could just about lock up a knockout spot with a win this afternoon, but suddenly the Philippines have thrown that into disarray. Sarina Bolden's goal was the result of near-perfect attacking play from Philippines, with Sara Eggesvik's cross put perfectly in her path and the leap and header was clean. New Zealand will be disappointed by the efforts of defenders CJ Bott and Rebekah Stott, while goalie Victoria Esson got both hands to it right in front of her face but couldn't handle. New Zealand beat Norway in their opener, and now if this game stays like this, the group is completely wide open. Especially if Norway beat Switzerland tonight, then every team in the group will be on one win each!",

Group: -3.2% Core Lithium: -2.8% We'll have more overseas news bright and early tomorrow, with earnings expected from Google-owner Alphabet during the US session, kicking off the big tech names reporting this week. Then mid-morning we'll have the all-important inflation data, with the quarterly consumer price index released by the ABS at 11:30am AEST — ahead of next Tuesday's Reserve Bank meeting. And this all comes ahead of the outcome of the Federal Reserve policy meeting in the US, which will be released Thursday our time. Sue Lannin will be with you tomorrow blogging all the day's market action. And in the meantime, you can tune into The Business tonight at 8:45pm AEST on the ABC News Channel and anytime on iView. On tonight's program, Nassim Khadem reports on who is jumping into the property market and how they're affording it, while Kirsten Aiken speaks to S & P on rising mortgage stress and previews the inflation report with Angela Jackson from Impact Economics.",

And that's despite only 86 stocks on the benchmark index making a gain. There were some big gains where it mattered, with Fortescue (+4.6%), Rio Tinto (+3.4%), BHP (+3.3%) and South32 (+3.5%) leading the materials and giving a big boost to the market, while Woodside (+1.2%) and Whitehaven (+2.2%) rose in the energy sector. With local earnings season looming, though, the iron ore miners could soon come under pressure again — Rio Tinto will release its results after the close tomorrow and half-year earnings are expected to have fallen. Consumer stocks were not so buoyant — the big supermarkets Woolworths (-0.5%) and Coles (-0.3%) made modest losses while Wesfarmers dropped 0.9 per cent — the retailer said it will be merging the back-end operations of Target and Kmart. The major banks also ended in the red.",
