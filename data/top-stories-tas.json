The Council of Foreign Relations (CFR) convened an expert panel and the first question asked was, well, what would an escalation look like? Lowy distinguished fellow in US-Middle East diplomacy at the CFR Martin S Indyk said: \"I think there's a high potential for escalation just because Israel is inevitably going to retaliate in a very strong way, possibly—I would say at this point even likely — go into Gaza. And the result of that would be a very high loss of life on the Palestinian side.\" Indyk said the role of Iran in the attack on Israel was not yet clear. \"But if this is coordinated, as I suspect it is, then I think we can see a situation where Hezbollah could well join in, and then we've got a regional conflagration the dimensions on which we have not seen,\" he said. \"Hopefully we can head that off, but it's not going to be easy. There's a potential for eruption in the West Bank. Terrorist attacks against Israeli settlers would draw another harsh response in the West Bank. \"There is a high potential for escalation.\"",
