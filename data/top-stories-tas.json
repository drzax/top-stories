I'd really like to see the prime minister lean in on that.\" The Arrernte/Luritja woman from Central Australia, told ABC News that the next steps forward need to ensure Aboriginal people have agency in conversations and solutions made about them in an attempt to close the gap. \"The path we went down ahead of referendum clearly isn't going to be the one we walk together but we do need to sort this out. We do need to keep moving because the issues that brought us to the referendum exist with us today, Those stats relating to closing the gap still exist and they need a different solution, and [that needs] to be a solution that's defined by Aboriginal people who know what is happening with the underlying drivers, who know how to solve that,\" she said. She said it was important these \"challenging\" conversations were had in a way that did not damage vulnerable children. \"I think that's about having kind conversations, that's about looking for hope, that's about looking for what comes next and charting that pathway,\" she said about protecting children post-referendum. \"Being honest and being really aware what you say in public and how you say it is heard by our children. \"And even when you look back at election night, children were watching, children were watching that result and they were watching how people responded.\"",

Last month, Mr Dutton told Sky News he would hold a referendum to recognise First Australians in the constitution if he was elected, saying: \"I believe very strongly it is the right thing to do.\" But speaking to reporters in Canberra this morning about the federal opposition's Indigenous policy, Mr Dutton said it was clear Australians were \"over\" the referendum process. \"Look, all of our policy, obviously as I said on Saturday night, is going to be reviewed in the process that Kerrynne [Liddle] and Jacinta [Nampijinpa Price] will lead now,\" he said. \"I think that [constitutional recognition] is important, but I think it's clear that the Australian public is probably over the referendum process for some time.\" The position puts him at odds with some of his Coalition colleagues, including Senator Price.",

Shares slumped 13% on opening day and it's kept going from there. IFR News called it: \"One of the worst starts for a major US IPO and almost certainly the death knell for hopes of a significant rebound in new issues in the final three months of the year.\" (As in, 'Who on earth would be dumb enough to float a company between now and Christmas after this debacle?'). Shares dropped another 6.6% to US$37.55 in their second session on Thursday. \"A punchy valuation, poor timing, buyside skittishness and a vain effort to create scarcity in the stock marred the sandal-maker's NYSE offering, forcing sponsor L Catterton to accept a price in the lower half of the marketing range\". Who to blame? Private equity's system of buying something and then trying to sell it for way more is chief among the issues. Private equity firm L Catterton pitched Birkenstock as being worth US$10 billion. But that's more than twice what the private equity firm paid for the company in April 2021. The market now has the company valued at US$6.8 billion.",
