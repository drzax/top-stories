Research by property marketplace Domain suggests Australia's housing market will have recovered from the 2022 downturn in the coming financial year, with some capital cities to see new record high house and unit prices. The Domain Forecast Report expects house prices in Sydney, Adelaide and Perth will reach a new record high, while unit prices will jump in Brisbane, Adelaide and Hobart. Here's a quick rundown of how much house prices are expected to rise in the capitals: Sydney: 6-9% Melbourne: 0-2% Brisbane: 1-4% Perth: 1-3% Adelaide: 2-5% Hobart: 3-5% Canberra: 2-4% Domain's chief of research and economics, Nicola Powell, says strong demand is responsible for the higher prices in the near future. \"Population pressures will lead the charge in factors driving housing demand and property prices higher over the next 12 months,\" she said. \"Australia has seen an exponential increase in temporary and permanent migration since the international border reopened in late 2021 to alleviate skills shortages. \"Of course, unlike natural population growth, those arriving from overseas aren’t already housed. \"This puts us in a position where in the next financial year alone, nearly 130,000 extra dwellings will be needed, with the Eastern Seaboard receiving the largest share of migrants.\"",
