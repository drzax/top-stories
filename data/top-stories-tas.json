Gauff was ahead 6-4, 1-0 when play was halted for at least 40 minutes. Tournament referee Jake Garner came out onto the court, while security headed toward where the protesters were. They were wearing shirts that read End Fossil Fuels. At least one person glued their feet to the ground, making it harder to be removed, a spokesman for the US Tennis Association said. At least two protesters were taken away. Later, more than a half-dozen police officers arrived — greeted by cheers from fans near the section where the disruption happened.",
