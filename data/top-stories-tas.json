But despite the global economic challenges, he says Australia is well placed to navigate a slower economic environment. He also acknowledged the current state of the economy with higher interest rates and inflation impacting thousands of households. Here's his statement in full: \"The RBA report is an important reminder of the ongoing pressures facing the global financial system and the global economy,\" he said. \" Higher interest rates, persistent inflation and the slowdown in China, particularly its struggling property sector, are weighing on global growth and will inevitably contribute to slower growth at home over the year ahead. \"In the face of the challenges coming at us from around the world, Australia's resilient labour market and well-regulated financial system are among our strengths. \"We know Australians are doing it tough and higher interest rates will continue to bite, particularly as more and more households come off lower fixed-rate mortgages. \"In these difficult times, the Albanese Government is focused on making the budget more responsible and our economy more resilient, while rolling out billions of dollars of cost-of-living relief in a way that doesn't add to inflationary pressures .",

It's all because the fund manager reported a $4 billion drop in funds under management as of September, down to $35 billion. Investors clearly are not happy. PEXA Group has also been in the red, down by -5.5%. Macquarie has cut its price target for the digital property settlements platform because of its acquisition of UK-based Smoove. The brokerage says the deal lacks execution details and that Smoove is a loss making business. When it comes to the sectors: energy and healthcare are leading the losses (-0.5% and -0.3% respectively). The sectors doing well today are academic and education services (+0.5%), financials (+0.3%) and industrials (+0.3%). Let's take a look at the top movers : QBE Insurance (+2.3%) Iress Ltd (+2%) Telix Pharmaceuticals (+1.8%) Block Inc (+1.8%) Aristocrat Leisure (+1.7%) The bottom movers are: Magellan Financial Group (-12.7%) PEXA Group (-5.5%) IGO Ltd (-3.1%) Core Lithium (-2.7%) Neuren Pharmaceuticals (-2.5%)",

Here are the key findings: It says higher inflation and interest rates continue to put pressure on household budgets, however, most borrowers are coping with the higher costs. Lower income households spend a larger share of their income on housing and essential items, therefore they are the most impacted by inflation. Home owners with variable rate mortgages have seen their payments increase by up to 50%, but the vast majority of borrowers have continued to service their debts. Borrowers who fixed their interest rates at record low rates (accounting for about 1/5 of housing credit) will roll of onto higher rates over the rest of this year (you know, the mortgage cliff!) however the bank says they don't appear to be at more risk than other borrowers, since they've benefited from an extended period of low rates. A small, but rising share of borrowers are in the early stages of financial stress. There's only been a slight deterioration in the banks' credit quality (because borrowers are mostly able to service their debts) And the banks are well placed to handle more funding and liquidity stress. Globally, China remains one of the biggest risks, because of its weakening property sector. However, the review says the direct links between Australia and China's financial systems are small.",
