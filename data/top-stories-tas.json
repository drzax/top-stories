Off the back of those comments — which, for the record, Gurner has apologised for — Senator Pocock asked Bullock if she agreed with his general idea that increased unemployment was needed to \"discipline inflation\". Here's how Bullock responded to that: \" I don't think those words have ever come out of my mouth, the idea that unemployment has to increase to discipline inflation ,\" she said. \"What has been the case in the last year or so has been that the labour market has been very tight. The [job] vacancy rate at one point was as high as the unemployment rate, which meant there was a vacancy for every unemployed person. \"The problem was that the vacancies weren't in the areas that the unemployed people had skills in, so what was happening was that the people that were available to fill the positions were churning, and that was being encouraged by increased wage rises and bonuses and things like that to get people. \"That was a sign that the labour market was very tight and there was not a lot that could be done there. Really, it came down to demand. \"So what monetary policy is trying to do is ease demand a bit, which will ease demand for workers. \"What we're forecasting is that employment will continue to grow, but it just won't grow as quickly as the workforce. So that mechanical outcome of that is that the unemployment rate rises, but I wouldn't put it as you have done that somehow we need to discipline the workers. I wouldn't put it like that.\" (For what it's worth, Bullock came under fire for telling an event in Newcastle back in June — when she was deputy governor — that the RBA forecasted the unemployment rate to increase to 4.5 per cent by 2024 .)",
