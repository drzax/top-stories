The Fed tracks the PCE price indexes for its 2 per cent inflation target. The data revealed a âbetter than expected but still elevated inflation picture,â said Eric Freedman, chief investment officer at US Bank Asset Management. The highly anticipated PCE data followed the recent hawkish long-term outlook for rates from the US Federal Reserve, which has rattled stocks as benchmark Treasury yields climbed to 16-year highs. âEquity investors are finally waking up to the Fed and the Fed comments that it is going to be higher for longer, and there is an alternative to stocks,â said Paul Nolte, senior wealth advisor and market strategist for Murphy & Sylvest Wealth Management.",
