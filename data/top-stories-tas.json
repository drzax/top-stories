It comes after Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu suggested his country would maintain security control of Gaza for an \"indefinite period\" after its bombardment, which has killed 10,500 people in a month, according to Palestinian health authorities. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has laid out the most detail to date about America's vision for a post-war two-state solution. He said the \"key elements\" should include: No forcible displacement of Palestinians from Gaza. \"Not now, not after the war.\" No use of Gaza as a platform for terrorism No reoccupation of Gaza after the war No attempt to blockade or besiege Gaza It's \"clear that Israel cannot reoccupy Gaza\", Blinken said. \"We must also work on the affirmative elements to get to a sustained peace. These must include the Palestinian people's voices and aspirations at the centre of post-crisis governance in Gaza. It must include Palestinian-led governance, and Gaza unified with the West Bank under the Palestinian Authority.\" Mr Blinken's comments highlight a widening gap between the US and Israel on the longer-term goals for the region. None of the ideas that Israeli officials have raised for Gaza's governance after the war have included independent Palestinian rule as a credible possibility. Reporting with AP",

There was no immediate Israeli comment or details from the scene of the reported attack, which if confirmed would be the third on Gaza's largest refugee camp in a week. Israeli air strikes devastated parts of the camp on October 31 and November 1, flattening multi-storey dwellings in a densely populated area in Gaza's urban heartland, and Palestinian authorities said at least 195 civilians were killed. Israel said its air attacks on Jabalia last week killed two Hamas commanders and a number of militants while targeting operational tunnels dug beneath civilian districts. Thousands of Palestinian civilians fled the north during a four-hour window of opportunity announced by Israel that it says is to avoid residents being trapped in the violence. But the central and southern parts of the small, besieged Palestinian enclave also came under fire again. Palestinian health officials said an air strike that hit houses in the Nusseirat refugee camp killed 18 people on Wednesday morning. In Khan Younis, six people, including a young girl, were killed in an air strike. The Israeli military said its forces had advanced into the heart of Gaza city, Hamas's main bastion in the territory, while the Islamist group said its fighters had inflicted heavy losses. Palestinian officials said 10,569 people had been killed, 40 per cent of them children. Israel struck at Gaza in response to a cross-border Hamas raid on southern Israel on October 7 in which gunmen killed 1,400 people, mostly civilians, and took about 240 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.

              "plaintext": "National Australia Bank has posted an 7.6 per cent rise in its annual statutory net profit to $7.41 billion as it benefited from elevated interest rates, while flagging fierce competition in the country's mortgage market. The bank reported higher earnings on deposits and capital against the backdrop of a high interest rate environment, which has in recent times allowed Australian lenders to widen their margins and capitalise on higher borrowing costs. NAB's annual net interest margin, a closely watched measure that shows the amount banks take in interest payments minus operating costs, rose 9 basis points to 1.74 per cent on an adjusted basis. The bank, however, said it was still struggling to fight strong competition in the home-lending market and dealing with higher wholesale funding costs. \"The impact of the higher interest rate environment has also supported FY23 results, but has been increasingly offset by elevated competition and inflationary pressures in the second half of the year,\" CEO Ross McEwan said. NAB's earnings in the second half of 2023 were softer compared to the first half due to the impact of inflation and monetary policy tightening pressuring households. The lender's cash profit came in at $7.73 billion for the year ended September 30, compared with $7.10 billion a year earlier. Analysts had expected a profit of $7.80 billion, according to Visible Alpha estimates compiled by Citi. NAB reported a jump in its credit impairment charge (CIC) for the year, highlighting volume growth and worsening asset quality. CIC was $802 million in fiscal 2023, compared with $125 million a year earlier. The bank declared a final dividend of 84 Australian cents per share, up from 78 Australian cents apiece a year earlier.",

              "plaintext": "World stock markets slid on Wednesday and the US dollar gained for a third straight day as some investors accepted the notion that while the US Federal Reserve may have halted hiking interest rates, they will still stay higher for longer. Yields across the Treasury curve mostly fell as the auction of benchmark 10-year notes was modestly better than expected and the view that the Fed has likely ended its hiking cycle kept downward momentum in place. The dollar also has rebounded from last week's sharp selloff amid rising confidence the Fed has ended raising rates, though there is less agreement on whether a rate cut is on the horizon with inflation still above the US central bank's 2 per cent target. \"The Fed not necessarily hiking anymore might get people a little bit more excited, but does that mean that we're going to start cutting aggressively? It's too early to say that,\" said Marvin Loh, senior global macro strategist at State Street in Boston. \"A lot of the questions that we were asking that drove yields higher we're still asking,\" he said, referring to the bond rally that raised the 10-year yield above 5 per cent two weeks ago. Bond prices move inversely to their yield. Fed Chair Jerome Powell did not comment on monetary policy or the economic outlook in prepared remarks at a US central bank statistic conference. Investors have ramped up bets for Fed rate cuts next year, though when has not been resolved. Markets are pricing in an almost 50 per cent chance of a rate cut of at least 25 basis points as soon as May, according to the CME Group's FedWatch Tool, compared with about 41 per cent a week earlier. But futures also call for the Fed's overnight lending rate to remain above 5 per cent through next June. MSCI's all-country world stock index shed 0.1 per cent after last week posting its biggest weekly jump in almost a year.",
