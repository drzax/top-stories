The Codex Sassoon, a leather-bound, handwritten parchment volume containing a nearly complete Hebrew Bible, was purchased by Alfred H. Moses, a former US ambassador to Romania, on behalf of the American Friends of ANU, a group which supports the ANU Museum of the Jewish People in Tel Aviv. The group will donate the bible to the museum, where it was previously exhibited as part of a worldwide tour before the auction, auction house Sotheby's said in statement. The Codex Sassoon is believed to have been assembled sometime between 880 and 960. It got its name in 1929 when it was purchased by David Solomon Sassoon, a son of an Iraqi Jewish business magnate who filled his London home with his collection of Jewish manuscripts. It's one of highest prices for a manuscript sold at auction. In 2021, a rare copy of the US constitution sold for $US43 million ($64.5 million). Leonardo da Vinci's Codex Leicester sold for $US31 million in 1994, or around $US60 million ($90 million) in today's dollars.",

While you were sleeping, there was a bounce of optimism in the United States, as its citizens were reassured by their president that \"America will not default\". \"I’m confident that we'll get the agreement on the budget,\" Joe Biden added. The United States is facing the prospect of defaulting on trillions of dollars worth of loans, unless the Republicans and Democrats strike a deal to legally allow the US Department of Treasury to incur more debt, which would allow it to pay its bills. US Treasury officials say that, unless a deal is reached, the US risks running out of money to pay its debts as soon as June 1, and this could trigger a recession, sparking fears of a global economic and financial crisis. But those comments by Biden have seemed to soothe equity markets there, at least, for now. And of course, Australian shares are set to follow. Meanwhile, the US dollar rose overnight, pushing the Australian currency against the greenback slightly down to 66.62 US cents. Let's hope those sixes aren't ominous. Here in Australia, we have labour force data out at 11:30am AEST. Will Australia’s unemployment remain steady at near a 50 year low of 3.5 per cent, or will we start to get an uptick as interest rates crimp demand? We'll be here keeping you updated.",
