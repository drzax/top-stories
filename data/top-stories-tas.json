He said the data was \"very welcome news because it shows we are making progress\" at reducing inflation in the economy. \"The ABS’s monthly CPI indicator rose 4.9% in the 12 months to July, the lowest outcome since February 2022 ,\" he said. \"This is down from 5.4% in 12 months to June and much lower than the peak of 8.4% in the year to December 2022. \"It's pleasing to see inflation is moderating but we know it will remain higher than we'd like for longer than we'd like.\" Mr Chalmers also said the federal government's energy bill relief package contributed to a smaller monthly rise in power prices. \"In today's monthly CPI indicator, electricity prices increased 6% in the month of July,\" he said. \"But without the Albanese government's energy bill relief that we're delivering in partnership with the states, the Australian Bureau of Statistics estimates electricity prices would have increased 19.2% over the same period.\"",
