A key takeaway is that the Fed's staff are no longer forecasting a recession, expecting inflation to come down without a huge jump in unemployment or an economic contraction. However, that forecast is not based on a prediction that interest rates will soon be lowered. \"We think we're going to need to hold, certainly, policy at restrictive levels for some time, and we'd be prepared to raise further if we think that's appropriate,\" Mr Powell told reporters. For traders optimistically expecting a swathe of rate cuts next year, Mr Powell played down the odds. \"Many people wrote down rate cuts for next year,\" he said. \"I think the median was several, for next year, and that's going to be a judgment that we have to make then, a full year from now.\" However, traders seemed to largely ignore that comment. \" Markets continue to price around a 40 per cent chance of a follow up hike by November, though pricing of cuts extended with 136bps [basis points] of cuts thereafter by end of 2024 (up from 130bps yesterday),\" wrote Mr Strickland. A constant theme through Powell's presser was that the Fed's decisions are going to be driven by the latest data more than its forecasts. This is what he said about the Fed's next meeting. \"We're going to look at two additional job reports, two additional CPI reports, lots of activity data. That's what we're going to look at, and we're going to make that decision then,\" he told journalists. \"That decision could mean another hike in September or it could mean that we decide to maintain at that level .\" Can't get a much clearer message than that — forget your forecasts and look at the latest numbers people.",

The big news overnight was the US Federal Reserve rates decision. There were no surprises, with the Fed lifting its benchmark overnight funds rate to between 5.25 and 5.5%. The mid-point of that range is the highest cash rate in the US since early 2001. Fed chair Jerome Powell left open the possibility of another rate hike next month, while also playing down the prospect of any rate cuts in the short term. \"It's certainly possible that we will raise funds again at the September meeting if the data warranted,\" he told reporters. \"I would also say it's possible that we would choose to hold steady and we're going to be making careful assessments, as I said, meeting by meeting.\" Financial markets are currently pricing in around an 80 per cent chance the Fed holds rates steady next month, according to Refinitiv data, amid signs US inflation is slowing quite quickly.",
