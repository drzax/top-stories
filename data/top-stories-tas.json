Coronado's quarterly group saleable production is up 22% compared to its March quarter to 4.5 million tonnes, while its group run of mine (ROM) coal production was 15% higher to 7.2 million tonnes. Its revenue for the June quarter came in at $US728 million ($1 billion), with capital expenditure totalling $US48 million ($70.8 million). Although Coronado has flagged higher capital expenditure for the 2023 financial year, it's also expecting coking coal prices to remain well above the long-term average, and demand to continue to rise. Put that all together, and it makes sense why its share price is tracking up today — it's given investors something to be optimistic about.",

The complaint filed in Delaware bankruptcy court also names as defendants Caroline Ellison, who led Bankman-Fried's Alameda Research hedge fund; former FTX technology chief Zixiao \"Gary\" Wang ; and former FTX engineering director Nishad Singh. FTX said the defendants continually misappropriated funds to finance luxury condominiums, political contributions, speculative investments and other \"pet projects\", while committing \"one of the largest financial frauds in history\". The alleged fraudulent transfers occurred between February 2020 and November 2022 when FTX filed for Chapter 11 protection, and could be undone — or \"avoided\" — under the US bankruptcy code or Delaware law, FTX said. A spokesman for Bankman-Fried declined a request for comment from Reuters. Bankman-Friend has pleaded not guilty to several criminal charges, while Ellison, Wang and Singh have pleaded guilty and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors.",
