Energy stocks jumped 2.2%, far exceeding the next best sector, which was a 0.6% rise for consumer cyclicals. Academic and educational services was the worst performing sector (-2.7%), which was entirely due to IDP Education's fall by the same percentage. Five biggest gains on ASX 200: Lake Resources: +27.3% to $0.21 Boral: +8.5% to $4.74 Sayona Mining: +7.7% to $0.14 AUB Group: +6.3% to $28.58 Paladin Energy: +5.9% to $0.805 Five biggest losses on ASX 200: Downer EDI: -6.4% to $4.10 Xero: -3.7% to $117.50 Abacus SK: -3.6% to $1.205 AGL Energy: -3.1% to $11.22 Rio Tinto: -2.8% to $109.65 Downer, QBE (1.2%) and AGL lost ground on profit reports that disappointed investors, while building materials firm Boral pleasantly surprised with its $148.1 million profit based on a 76% jump in its profit margin to 6.7%. AMP was also a major mover higher, rising 4.6% to $1.15 on its profit result. Overall, the ASX 200 gained 0.3% to 7,357 points. That's it from the team today, Kate Ainsworth will be following the market action tomorrow, when outgoing RBA governor Philip Lowe makes his last parliamentary appearance, along with incoming governor Michele Bullock .",

Unusually, the bank was somewhat at pains to talk down its profitability, pointing out that a return on equity of 14% was well below peaks closer to 20% around a decade ago. And Barrenjoey's very experienced banking analyst Jon Mott believes that could fall even further to 12% as the bank faces cost pressures from inflation, a declining net interest margin and growing loan losses as bad debts rise. He has an $85 price target on CBA shares, about 18% below its current share price of $103.77. \"CBA remains in a solid position with a strong management team, dominant share in retail banking and a growing business banking presence. However, the macro and competitive environments are challenging,\" he wrote. \"We believe that the risk/return outlook is skewed to the downside.\" One of the big risks is how many of CBA's mortgage customers will be able to keep paying their home loans if interest rates go higher, or even remain at current levels. CBA's CEO Matt Comyn told Kirsten Aiken on The Business that the bank has already called about 100,000 customers it considered financially at risk to ask them if they needed any assistance. Hundreds of thousands of CBA customers are rolling off cheap fixed rate loans over the next year or so, going from rates around 2% to variable rates above 6%. And, even for those who aren't in \"mortgage prison\" and can refinance, it turns out that it's harder to get a cheap deal. As Stephanie Chalmers explains, below, banks (especially the big four) are dialing back aggressive cash back offers and rate discounts for new customers as they seek to maintain their net interest margins and profitability.",
