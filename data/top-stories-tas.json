That pesky 'higher for longer' catchphrase about interest rates is really dragging us all down - metaphorically/ emotionally/ psyhcologiacally/ financially - take your pick! US Treasury yields (take a look at the snapshot pinned above we're now keeping a closer eye on them here on the blog) are higher on fears the US Federal Reserve will hike its interest rate next week. That's limiting some of the risk taking in financial markets. \"There is no anchor in US treasuries,\" said Ben Luk, Senior Multi Asset Strategist at State Street Global Markets. \"If (the 10-year yield) doesn't stay below 5%, then I think it's still going to be a very choppy market for both US and Asia.\" Hong Kong's Hang Seng, Japan's Nikkei, China's SSE Index, South Korea's KOSPI and New Zealand's S & P 50 are all lower in today's trading session.",
