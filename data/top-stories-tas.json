However, the results were more than a third down on last year's profit of $811 million. Harvey Norman enjoyed strong sales and profits during the COVID-19 pandemic, with customers buying home furnishings and office supplies during lockdowns. But franchise and company-operated sales revenue was down this year as many Australians struggle with the rising cost of living. Chairman Gerry Harvey said the company has delivered 40% growth in net assets since the beginning of the pandemic. \"Our balance sheet remains strong with total assets of $7.67 billion, anchored by a $4 billion property portfolio.\" While the majority of its stores are in Australia, Harvey Norman has stores across 8 countries including New Zealand, Singapore and Ireland. The retailer plans to expand to 80 stores in Malaysia by the end of 2028, including a further 8 stores this year. The company will pay a final dividend of 12 cents per share, taking the full-year dividend to 25 cents per share, down from 37.5 cents last year.",

It's just the second loss the organisation has posted since it became a self-funded government business enterprise in 1989. Growth in the parcels business was fairly flat, bringing in $7.3 billion in revenue. However, as expected, the letters business continues to decline, resulting in a loss of $384 million. The average Australian household receives only 2.2 addressed letters each week and that's expected to further halve in the next five years. Group chief executive offer Paul Graham said despite the organisation's efforts, it's not possible to stop the structural shift in the way Australians are using postal services. \"If we do everything in our power to run this business well and we get a favourable regulatory response towards modernisation, I'm confident that Australia Post will return to profit,\" he said.",
