Given the RBA's \"hawkish rhetoric over the past two weeks\" and the \"uncomfortably high\" September quarter inflation data, ANZ says it's expecting the cash rate to reach its highest level since November 2011 — but noted the hike wasn't certain. \"The RBA has also highlighted risks of inflation expectations becoming embedded given ongoing shocks to energy prices, with consumers’ inflation expectations typically being quite responsive to petrol prices,\" ANZ's head of economics Adam Boyton wrote. \"While an additional interest rate increase will put further pressure on already strained finances across some households, the RBA’s most recent Financial Stability Review observed that households and businesses in Australia have, overall, coped reasonably well with the [4 percentage point] cash rate hikes so far. \"Having said that, a rate hike in November is not certain. Major inputs into the RBA’s longer-term inflation forecast are unlikely to have changed materially. \"Wages growth has generally undershot the RBA's expectations over this cycle, while the likely increase in productivity in Q3 should provide some comfort to the Bank that a reversion to the pre-COVID trend is plausible. That is, the longer-term inflation forecasts could well be unaffected by today's data. \"As a result, a decision to increase rates in November could well be a response to the risk that inflation might not return to target within a reasonable timeframe. A risk highlighted by the resilience of inflation in the [September inflation data].\"",

She says the quarterly 1.2% inflation increase means we're in a \"grey zone\" but it isn't enough to say for certain whether it will prompt the RBA to lift the cash rate on November 7. \"A key number I was looking for was that underlying measure of inflation, and coming out of 1.2% over the quarter, I think that there is a complete 50-50 coin toss as to whether the RBA will hike rates in November because it is a bit of a grey area,\" she said. \"I was thinking if the number was closer to 1.3% then the Reserve Bank would probably hike, but 1.2% probably does still mean that inflation projections over the next two years are still intact. \"They are forecasting inflation to only come down from its target band of 2.5% by 2025, so I think a 1.2% underlying inflation figure still does keep that in line, but it probably will concern them because we have seen that underlying inflation has ticked up from last quarter at 0.9% and it has now got up to 1.2%. \"When I look at the components in today's data there are still signs that in services you are still seeing sticky prices, which is what [RBA] governor Bullock has been talking about the past few times she has spoken in recent weeks.\"",
