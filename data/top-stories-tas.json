                  "articleBody": "Analysis from EY shows Australia's big four banks reported combined statutory earnings of $16.77 billion in their half-yearly results — a 10.8% increase compared to this time last year. But EY says the major banks are walking a \"challenging tightrope\" and will have to manage competing demands from investors, customers, regulators and government in \"an increasingly uncertain and volatile backdrop\". EY says cash rate rises are boosting revenues and net interest margins, while higher earnings have pushed up return on equity, although some signs of mortgage stress are emerging. \"Australia's major banks are walking a tightrope as headwinds for the sector intensify. The resilience of the Australian economy continued to support credit growth and quality throughout the first half of the year,\" said EY Oceania Banking and Capital Markets Leader, Doug Nixon. \"However, intense competition in response to retail credit growth compression, coupled with rising funding costs, amplified by the recent dislocation in financial markets, will likely erode the benefits the banks have gained from the higher interest rate environment. \"So, while Australia's major banks remain strong and resilient, pressure on net interest margins, combined with the increasingly uncertain operating environment, means they face a complex high-wire balancing act when it comes to managing profitable growth, customer expectations, investment priorities and shareholder returns.\""

The price of bitcoin is down to its lowest in nearly a week, at around $41,000. Withdrawals have since resumed."

NAB chief economist Alan Oster says business conditions remain strong, particularly in transport, utilities and mining, while construction remains the softest. \"[This] reflects the ongoing challenge of elevated input prices putting pressure on profits for businesses in the building sector,\" he said. \"[Business] confidence is still below average but has stabilised around 0 index points over recent months. \"A zero reading for confidence in the survey indicates that an equal share of firms are optimistic as pessimistic, which highlights how the outlook is finely balanced. \"Overall, the survey shows the economy remains resilient.\""

Previously its licence was set to expire on July 1. That's been music to the ears of investors, with its share price up 11% so far. Other big movers so far include: Lake Resources +5% Karoon Energy +3.8% Core Lithium +3.1% Champion Iron +2.9% At the other end, Bellevue Gold has dropped the most so far — it's down 2%. The other major falls have gone to: De Grey Mining -1.6% Evolution Mining +1.3% Cochlear -1.1% Capricorn Metals -1% And unsurprisingly, Westpac has had some positive movement — so far its share price is up 3% thanks to its mammoth $4 billion profit posted in its half-yearly results."

One of the key measures that makes up this $14.6 billion relief package over four years includes a $1.5 billion energy bill subsidy for more than 5 million households and 1 million small businesses. Those eligible (pensioners, small businesses, and those on income support) will receive up to $500 relief on their power bills, but the size of the assistance depends on where you live. You can hear more about the energy bill relief package in tomorrow night's budget here:"

If you're as excited as I am about the budget (you are on a markets and financial blog, after all) you'll have keenly spotted the federal government is out spruiking a near- $15 billion cost of living package to be unveiled in tomorrow night's budget. The $14.6 billion support package over four years is aimed to ease pressure on households and businesses, including $1.5 billion for electricity bill relief for 5.5 million households and 1 million small businesses. (I'll unpack what we know about the relief package shortly.) On the markets front, we can expect the local sharemarket to open higher with ASX futures up, and greater investor sentiment thanks to all three major benchmarks gaining. Investors are also waiting for Westpac's half yearly results, which have just dropped as I post this. Let's get into it, shall we?"

EY says cash rate rises are boosting revenues and net interest margins, while higher earnings have pushed up return on equity, although some signs of mortgage stress are emerging. \"Australia's major banks are walking a tightrope as headwinds for the sector intensify. The resilience of the Australian economy continued to support credit growth and quality throughout the first half of the year,\" said EY Oceania Banking and Capital Markets Leader, Doug Nixon. \"However, intense competition in response to retail credit growth compression, coupled with rising funding costs, amplified by the recent dislocation in financial markets, will likely erode the benefits the banks have gained from the higher interest rate environment. \"So, while Australia's major banks remain strong and resilient, pressure on net interest margins, combined with the increasingly uncertain operating environment, means they face a complex high-wire balancing act when it comes to managing profitable growth, customer expectations, investment priorities and shareholder returns.\"",

If you're as excited as I am about the budget (you are on a markets and financial blog, after all) you'll have keenly spotted the federal government is out spruiking a near- $15 billion cost of living package to be unveiled in tomorrow night's budget. The $14.6 billion support package over four years is aimed to ease pressure on households and businesses, including $1.5 billion for electricity bill relief for 5.5 million households and 1 million small businesses. (I'll unpack what we know about the relief package shortly.) On the markets front, we can expect the local sharemarket to open higher with ASX futures up, and greater investor sentiment thanks to all three major benchmarks gaining. Investors are also waiting for Westpac's half yearly results, which have just dropped as I post this. Let's get into it, shall we?",

              "plaintext": "Analysis from EY shows Australia's big four banks reported combined statutory earnings of $16.77 billion in their half-yearly results — a 10.8% increase compared to this time last year. But EY says the major banks are walking a \"challenging tightrope\" and will have to manage competing demands from investors, customers, regulators and government in \"an increasingly uncertain and volatile backdrop\". EY says cash rate rises are boosting revenues and net interest margins, while higher earnings have pushed up return on equity, although some signs of mortgage stress are emerging. \"Australia's major banks are walking a tightrope as headwinds for the sector intensify. The resilience of the Australian economy continued to support credit growth and quality throughout the first half of the year,\" said EY Oceania Banking and Capital Markets Leader, Doug Nixon. \"However, intense competition in response to retail credit growth compression, coupled with rising funding costs, amplified by the recent dislocation in financial markets, will likely erode the benefits the banks have gained from the higher interest rate environment. \"So, while Australia's major banks remain strong and resilient, pressure on net interest margins, combined with the increasingly uncertain operating environment, means they face a complex high-wire balancing act when it comes to managing profitable growth, customer expectations, investment priorities and shareholder returns.\"",
