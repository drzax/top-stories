Liontown is currently the subject of a $6.6 billion takeover bid by US chemicals giant Albemarle. It's possible that Ms Rinehart's intervention could force Albermarle to amend its bid for the Western Australia lithium explorer. How much does Rinehart own? Ms Rinehart's Hancock Prospecting group now controls 235.5 million shares in Liontown (or 10.69% of the company). That's a significant increase from a fortnight ago – when Liontown revealed that Ms Rinehart controlled almost 170 million shares (or 7.7% of the company). Over the past two weeks, Ms Rinehart's company has been buying Liontown shares (at $3 per share). Albemarle is about halfway through its one-month period of exclusive due diligence — scrutinising the progress at Liontown's facility at Kathleen Valley (which is still under construction). Liontown said it would start producing lithium in around nine months.",

This is the first time such a call has been made by the Australian and International Pilots Association (AIPA). In a statement, the association said it had written to Qantas chief executive Vanessa Hudson to inform her of the pilots' position. \"Richard Goyder has overseen one of the most damaging periods in Qantas history which has included the illegal sacking of 1,700 workers, allegations of illegally marketing cancelled flights, and a terribly managed return to operations after Covid-19,\" AIPA president Tony Lucas said. \"The morale of Qantas pilots has never been lower. We have totally lost confidence in Goyder and his Board. \"Qantas desperately needs a culture reset but how can this happen with Richard Goyder as chairman? \"Despite overseeing the destruction of the Qantas brand, Goyder last week accepted a near $100,000 pay rise — taking his pay to $750,000 — while staff are expected to accept a two-year wage freeze. This is a galling and tone-deaf decision.\" Here's the latest report from our senior business correspondent Peter Ryan :",
