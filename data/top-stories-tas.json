              "plaintext": "Petrol prices have been climbing as oil prices have increased. CommSec says petrol is up by nearly 23 per cent over the year, and by 16 per cent over the past two months. Although the national average petrol price fell 1.7 cents per litre last week to 201.7 cents a litre. Meanwhile, the ACCC today released its latest petrol monitoring report for the June quarter. It says retail petrol prices edged higher over the quarter, rising by 0.7 cents per litre from the March quarter to 182.9 cents a litre. Quarterly average retail petrol prices increased in most capital cities except Sydney. Average prices across more than 190 regional locations the ACCC monitors were 185.3 cents per litre, up 2.2 cents per litre from the previous quarter. Petrol prices were more expensive in regional areas than the five biggest cities of Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide and Perth. The competition regulator also says average retail diesel prices in Australia's five largest cities continued to decrease during the June quarter to similar levels as average retail petrol prices. In June, average retail diesel prices in the five largest cities fell to 181.2 cents a litre, cheaper than average retail petrol prices of 183.7 a litre. ACCC commissioner Anna Brakey explains why: “In the June quarter a number of international factors influenced the fall in diesel prices including further exports of diesel and gasoil from Russia despite sanctions, a decline in North American and European consumption, and an unexpected build-up in diesel inventories.\" “Retail diesel and petrol prices have trended higher in July and August, following increases in international crude oil and refined diesel and petrol benchmark prices, and a weaker AUD-USD exchange rate.\"",

The Australian dollar traded in a narrow range after rising 0.9 per cent overnight. Miners and healthcare stocks did the best, while energy and technology stocks weighed on the market. Liontown Resources (-0.3 per cent) fell after news that Gina Rinehart's Hancock Prospecting had increased its stake. Delta Lithium (6.5 per cent) jumped as Perth mining mogul and Mineral Resources boss Chris Ellison joined the board as its non executive chairman, and his lithium chief executive, Josh Thurlow, as a non executive director. Mineral Resources took a 17 per cent stake in Delta Lithium last month as big miners scoop up smaller lithium players. Wireless technology company Etherstack (+36.8%) jumped after signing an agreement with Telstra to trial and evaluate its Mission Critical 3GPP standards compliant Interworking Function technology for use in public safety communications in Australia. ASX 200 best and worst performers: Link Administration: +6 per cent Imugene: +5.1 per cent Pilbara Minerals: +4.3 per cent Syrah Resources: -7.4 per cent Viva Energy: -7.3 per cent BrainChip: -6.8 per cent",
