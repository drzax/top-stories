              "plaintext": "Good morning, it's Thursday, July 13 and you're reading the ABC's business and markets blog. The big news overnight that's buoyed global markets is that US inflation has slowed, with consumer prices seeing their smallest annual increase in more than two years. The CPI rose by 0.2% in June, slightly less than the general consensus of 0.3% expected by analysts — and the smallest annual increase since March 2021. Year-on-year, US CPI rose by 3%, but that is the smallest rise since 2021. Core inflation in June also rose to 4.8%, but is lower than the 5.3% increase the US saw in May. So does this mean rate hikes are off the table now for the Federal Reserve? It's unlikely to dissuade them from raising them at their meeting this month, but it's raised the possibility that the expected July hike of 0.25 percentage points could be the last. Off the back of the inflation data, US markets ended solidly higher on Wednesday (local time) with the Dow up 0.3%, S & P500 up 0.7%, and the Nasdaq jumping 1.2%. As for what's happening back home — the ASX is set for a positive day with futures trading higher so far this morning. But all eyes will be on Canberra today, where the bosses of Westpac and Commonwealth Bank are facing a grilling about interest rates during the second day of hearings in front of the the economics committee in parliament. It comes after ANZ and NAB's bosses gave evidence yesterday. It's shaping up to be a big day — grab a coffee and let's get into it.",
