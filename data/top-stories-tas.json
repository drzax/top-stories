I've put it to our global affairs editor John Lyons, who writes: Hello Rafski - you're right to raise Poland. Poland is so heavily invested in what happens in Ukraine for many reasons. I don't think Wagner is a particular threat to Poland. I think the real threat to Poland is Russia's general aggression. One thing that really struck me being in Ukraine and Poland recently is how crowded the highway from Poland is with tanks and other military hardware. Poland has become crucial as a launching pad for the continuing defence of Ukraine.",

Will Belarus have direct control over Wagner now or is this a sophisticated Russian trap? - Josh Hi Josh, thanks for writing in. I've put your question to our global affairs editor John Lyons, who writes: Hi Josh - I don't think we know the future of Wagner. There are many unanswered questions out of the latest drama and this is one of them. We hear reports that some Wagner fighters are angry with Prigozhin that he didn't let them know about the rebellion but it's hard to read. My view is that Prigozhin still has influence over many of them, especially if he can keep paying them. He is something of a cult-like leader to many of them. So I think the key to the future of Wagner lies with what Prigozhin does. Does he go back to Africa where he has many clients for \"security services\" such as Mali, and much wealth from gold and diamond mines there? Or does he sit in Belarus and watch what happens at the top of the Kremlin? I tend to think he wants to stay around and see what opportunities there are for him in Moscow.",

ACCI chief of policy and advocacy David Alexander: “After experiencing 12 interest rate increases, declining consumer spending, and a surge in input costs, it’s good news for small businesses that inflation is returning to its downward trend.\" “Many small businesses are seeing their costs rise to the point where they have no choice but to increase their prices to maintain operations.\" Australian Industry Group chief executive Innes Willox says the drop in inflation is encouraging, but more rate hikes will likely be needed. \"While encouraging for both households and businesses and bearing in mind that the monthly ABS excludes some items, we are not there yet. \" \"Sticking on the path to target inflation will require continued restraint in price setting and wage negotiations by businesses, governments and employees.\" \"With GDP growth of just 0.2 per cent in the March quarter, there is very little scope for further slowing without tipping the economy into contraction.\"",

Just confirming that is the logic here? - Tim. Hi Tim, You're one of a few keen commenters who have pointed this out. It sounds counterintuitive but you're right — that is exactly the logic here. RBA governor Philip Lowe told a Senate Estimates hearing in Canberra last month that higher interest rates would help alleviate some rental pressures in the short term because it would force people to \"economise\" on their housing — which translates to either living at home for longer, or getting housemates. Here's what he said: \"The way that this ends up fixing itself, unfortunately, is through higher housing prices and higher rents. \"Because as rents go up people decide not to move out of home, or you don't have that home office, you [get] a flatmate. \"The increase in supply can't happen immediately, but higher prices do lead people to economise on housing. \"That's the price mechanism at work. We need more people on average to live in each dwelling, and prices do that.\" Rents make up a solid chunk of the consumer price index (in fact, Mr Lowe says they're the \"single largest\" component) and expects rents will remain high for some time. Of course, long term we need to see an increase in housing supply — which Mr Lowe also acknowledged during Estimates. You can read the full story about Mr Lowe's justification for higher rents by my colleagues Gareth Hutchens and Rhiana Whitson below:",
