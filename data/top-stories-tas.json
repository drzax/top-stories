Consumer spending was anaemic over the June quarter, and Australia saw the largest fall in the terms of trade, the difference between export and import prices, since June 2009. The ABS says a warmer northern hemisphere winter reduced demand for coal and liquefied natural gas. Also iron ore prices fell because of weaker demand from China's construction and manufacturing industries. While prices fell, exports rose, driven by more international students coming here for education and increased tourism. HSBC chief economist Paul Bloxham says the Reserve Bank's interest rate rises are working to cool the economy. \"Today's GDP figures are likely to have been welcomed by the RBA   and, in particular, by Governor Lowe, whose seven-year term is about to end.\" \"The GDP figures provide a clear indication that the economy is, so far,   tracking what he has described as the 'narrow pathway' to a 'soft landing'. \" \"Today's figures showed clear evidence that monetary policy is working.\" But Mr Bloxham sees one more interest rate rise by the RBA of 0.25 per cent before the end of the year. \"The risk remains that the RBA may yet have to lift its cash rate a bit further to ensure that inflation gets back to its target band over what it deems to be a 'reasonable timeframe'.\"",
