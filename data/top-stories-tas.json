Good to be back on the busines With ASX futures higher, it looks like it could be a positive start for the Australian share market. Overnight, all three major US stock indexes ended the session sharply higher, as investors looked ahead to crucial economic data due later this week that could sway the Federal Reserve's interest rate decisions in the coming months. US economic indicators released on Tuesday showed dampening consumer sentiment and job openings dropping to their lowest level since March 2021, offering evidence that the central bank's efforts to rein in inflation by throwing cold water on the economy are having their intended effect. \"Today's data indicates that consumers are being cautious,\" said Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel in Charlottesville, Virginia. \"And a cautious consumer bodes well for efforts to control inflation; if consumers stop spending, prices will drop.\" ASX futures were up 47 points or 0.7 per cent to 7,209 at 7:18am AEST. At the same time, the Australian dollar was slightly down to 64.76 US cents.",
