China’s coal imports dipped slightly from March to April, with the year-on-year comparison slowing from 152% in March to 73% in April. \"The rise in imports has been accompanied by an increase in China’s domestic coal output. Typically, a synchronous increase in both coal production and imports indicates rising coal demand in China,\" CBA Commodities analyst Vivek Dhar notes. \"Industrial output data from last quarter does confirm this narrative. China’s crude steel output has increased ~6%/yr in Q1 2023, supporting the case for higher coking coal output and imports,\" henotes. \"Thermal power output (i.e. mostly coal) has also lifted ~2%/yr in the same time period, largely carried by a ~9%/yr increase in thermal power output in March.\" Mr Dhar says the increase in China’s coal imports likely indicates some opportunistic buying too. \"The sharp fall in international thermal coal prices relative to local prices has made it more attractive to purchase imports for the better part of this year. \" China’s thermal coal imports from Australia has been a key beneficiary of this price differential following the end of China’s unofficial ban on Australian coal, Mr Dhar notes. \"With the price differential now favouring local coal in the last few weeks, it’s likely that China’s coal imports from Australia will likely moderate. Alongside ongoing evidence of fading industrial demand, we expect China’s total coal imports will start sliding too,\" Mr Dhar notes. IRON ORE IMPORTS FELL IN APRIL China’s iron ore imports also dropped last month, down 10%. Like coal, China’s iron ore imports have eased in year‑on‑year terms from March to April. \"We think it will be challenging for China’s steel output and iron ore imports to keep expanding in coming months given China’s steel mill margins have remained in negative territory since late March. China’s gas imports, which includes both pipeline and LNG, rose by 1% in the month to April and 11% in the year to April.",
