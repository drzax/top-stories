After an aggressive hiking cycle that took rates to a 14-year high, the central bank has now sat on its hands since May's rate rise. Here's what the RBNZ monetary policy committee had to say about the decision: The current level of interest rates is constraining spending and hence inflation pressure, as anticipated and required. The Committee agreed that the [official cash rate] needs to stay at restrictive levels for the foreseeable future to ensure annual consumer price inflation returns to the 1 to 3% target range, while supporting maximum sustainable employment. The New Zealand economy is evolving broadly as anticipated. Activity continues to slow in parts of the economy that are more sensitive to interest rates. Labour shortages are easing as overall demand softens and immigration adds to labour resources. Headline inflation and inflation expectations have declined, but measures of core inflation remain too high. NZ's annual inflation rate declined to 6 per cent in the June quarter, while its unemployment rate is at 3.6 per cent. The RBNZ reviews the cash rate 7 times a year and will next announce a decision in October, after leaving rates unchanged in July and now August.",
