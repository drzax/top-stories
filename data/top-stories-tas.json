Nearly all sectors made gains with a strong showing from consumer firms, industrials, technology, banks and energy stocks.

That's despite saying it expects before tax profit for 2023 to come in at around $670 million, down from nearly $943 million last year. It expects net property valuations of $119 million over the year. Online bookmaker Pointsbet (+1.2 per cent) has unanimously recommended an improved offer from Fanatic's Betting and Gaming to buy its US business for $333 million. Rival suitor DraftKings has abandoned its offer for the business. Private hospital operator Ramsay Health Care (+5.4 per cent) and its Malaysian partner Sime Darby are considering the sale of their healthcare joint venture in Malaysia, Ramsay Sine Health Care (RSD). \"The decision has been reached following the receipt of significant inbound interest in RSD at values that are in shareholder interests,\" Ramsay told the ASX. Reuters reports that big miner Rio Tinto (+0.9 per cent) is setting up a battery testing plant at its research hub in suburban Melbourne. Chief executive of minerals Sinead Kaufman told a mining conference that the company was constructing a battery laboratory. \"At this lab, we will build our own batteries, allowing us to test how our minerals and other products will perform in real world applications, such as electric vehicle batteries,\" she says.",
