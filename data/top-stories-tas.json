The Westpac-Melbourne Institute index of consumer sentiment rose 2.7% in July to 81.3 points, the biggest gain since April when rates were also kept on hold. However, any score below 100 points means the pessimists outnumbered optimists. The survey's measure of family finances compared to a year ago remained gloomy with a fall of 4.9%, reflecting cost of living pressures. \"The key message is that sentiment is probably not going to stage a sustained lift from current deeply pessimistic levels until inflation is much lower and interest rates are firmly on hold,\" said Westpac chief economist Bill Evans. The RBA held rates steady at 4.1% last week, in the middle of the survey period, but warned that it might have to hike again to bring inflation to heel. Monthly inflation data for May showed a welcome slowdown to 5.6%, but core price measures remained stubbornly high. In a positive sign for demand, the survey's measure of whether it was a good time to buy a major household item rose 3.1% in July, while its index buying dwellings jumped 6.2%.",

It looks like the local share market will finally have a good day, with ASX SPI futures up 0.7% and small gains on Wall Street overnight. Australia's benchmark stock index (the ASX 200) has dropped 3.8% in the past four sessions. Likewise, the US stock market has fallen quite significantly in the past three days, but managed to recovery slightly overnight. The Dow Jones index rose 0.6%, while the S & P 500 and Nasdaq Composite were up 0.2% each. US inflation and earnings reports ahead Investors are cautiously awaiting the latest consumer inflation data from the world's largest economy, the United States. It will be released on Wednesday at 10:30pm AEST. Economists are predicting US headline inflation will slow to 3.1% (its lowest level since early 2021), down from 9.1% a year earlier. If inflation does moderate significantly, it will bolster bets the US Federal Reserve is near the end of its rate-hiking cycle. Meanwhile, S & P 500 company earnings are due to unofficially kick off this week with reports from some major companies (with JP Morgan, Wells Fargo, State Street and PepsiCo among those reporting their results). Analysts expect earnings to have fallen 6.4% in the June quarter from the year-ago period, according to Refinitiv data. In local economic news, we're looking out for the latest reports on consumer confidence (from Westpac and the Melbourne Institute) and business conditions (from NAB). These economic updates are scrutinised closely by investors and the Reserve Bank, and will provide an up-to-date picture of how the Australian economy is performing.",
