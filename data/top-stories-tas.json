Iron ore, copper and aluminium prices fell leading to a $US3.3 billion drop in earnings, although the bottom line was helped by increased iron ore sales. Iron ore prices fell by an average of 14 per cent and copper prices were 10 per cent lower over the half. Rio's earnings were also hit by an $US800 million ($1.2 billion) writedown of its alumina refineries in Australia.
