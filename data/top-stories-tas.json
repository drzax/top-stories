You might remember that I travelled to the tiny town of Elliott (population just 287!) earlier this year to speak to locals there about the split between Sun Cable's two early backers, Mike Cannon-Brookes and Andrew Forrest. Elliott had been earmarked as the closest town to the site of the export project's massive solar farm. But locals there were getting fed up with project delays and Sun Cable's voluntary administration, that came after a split between the two billionaires over its vision to export solar to Singapore. I still remember one local's message to MCB and Forrest: \"Get your act together\". As of today, MCB formally controls Sun Cable through his venture Grok, with local partners including Quinbrook. And MCB reckons it is still very much possible to generate mass amounts of solar in central Australia, and send it through to Darwin and then onto Singapore via a sub-sea cable. \"I acknowledge some people might think it's too ambitious, we don't believe it is,\" MCB told journalists in a briefing this afternoon. \"Frankly, the technology exists to make this happen. \"The next commodities boom in this country will not be founded on coal. It will be founded on the generation and export of our renewable energy. \"Sun Cable is a world changing project and will be at the heart of Australia's drive to become a renewable energy superpower. \" However, a final investment decision still hasn't been made. MCB says it'll come after talks with Singapore. He also confirmed that while the project will still very much continue to be based on sun, that it may also locally encorporate wind power. And as for his message to Elliott? He didn't confirm if it is still the chosen site of Sun Cable's solar farm when asked by ABC News, but did say he though the town's frustration was \"totally understandable\". \"I wouldn't have wished this to be the path of the company and the project it has to take. I can understand the confusion and uncertainty.\" \"I'm hopeful that we're not just exiting from that process, right? We are relaunching the project with new vim and vigor and commitment.\"",

He spoke to colleague Emily Stewart for her story on The Business tonight. On Mr Lowe's comments on better co-operation with government he said: \"The importance, I think of a greater alignment between monetary policy and fiscal policy, I think is very insightful, we do rely very heavily on monetary policy, high interest rates to control inflation. But as he [Mr Lowe] points out, that can have a very unequal impact on people through society, obviously, particularly impacting those with with very high debt levels and obviously facing the impact of high mortgage rates.\" When it comes to calling out productivity : \"I think he's also right to continue to point out the importance of boosting productivity. If we don't do that, if we don't build a consensus, as he says, to do that, then we will see our living standard suffer.\" And on Mr Lowe's comments about the media Dr Oliver said this: \"I think he also rightly pointed out that the media has a role to play in this as well, and he has been somewhat misinterpreted on several occasions in recent times, which has made the setting of monetary policy at least the communication of monetary policy, but more complicated than it otherwise needed to be.\" Dr Oliver also noted the tarnish that will forever be Mr Lowe's legacy: \"I think there's no doubt that Governor Lowe's legacy has been marred to some degree by the interest rate guidance in 2021, where he said that based on their current expectations, they didn't expect to raise interest rates until 2024. And of course, they had to start doing rate hikes through last year and of course, that threw many people ou t and got into the housing market. But by the same token, his heart was in the right place at the time, he was very fearful that the recovery in the economy would be very slow and consequently, unemployment would stay very high. So he was trying to provide confidence. It's always hard to know for sure, but I suspect that it did influence many people, otherwise, he wouldn't have made that guidance in the first place. He was he was hoping to encourage people to go out there and borrow and invest in housing and help the recovery in the economy. So I think there's no doubt that it had some impact people.\" You can see Emily's story on The Business tonight and on the ABC News YouTube channel later too.",
