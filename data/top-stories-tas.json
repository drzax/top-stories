Qantas has set the end of the year as the deadline for when outstanding flight credits — totalling at least $470 million — need to be claimed. Of that amount, $370 million is owed to Australian Qantas customers, and $100 million is owed to Jetstar customers. Yesterday Qantas executives Alan Joyce, Steph Tully and Andrew McGiness could not say the value of flight credits owed to overseas customers, but it was less than $100 million. Qantas said its goal is to have \"zero\" flight credits remaining by December 31. Speaking in Perth, Mr Albanese said customers should be given a choice to get a refund or credit on products they buy, but don't use. \"They [Qantas] need to look after their customers ... and there is no question that that needs to occur when people have made bookings in good faith,\" he said.",

              "plaintext": "The chief executive of Canberra Airport is calling for Qantas to be fined for its \"appalling\" flight cancellation rate. Fifty-three flights on its Canberra to Sydney route have been cancelled every month for the last six months — meaning Qantas has a cancellation rate of 11.5%. Qantas boss Alan Joyce yesterday told a Senate committee it was fairer to cancel more frequent Canberra to Sydney flights than regional flights that were less frequent. But Canberra Airport CEO Stephen Byron says that's not good enough. \"When you have a cancellation rate of above 10%, which is just extraordinary and double any of the other routes, I think the federal government's got to have a look at fining Qantas because they're the only ones that do it ,\" he said. \"If you fly Virgin to Sydney from Canberra, it's [the cancellation rate] about 3.6%, so Qantas cancel three times as often.\"",

              "plaintext": "The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) says steel manufacturer BlueScope Steel has been ordered to pay a $57.5 million penalty for attempting to fix prices for flat steel products supplied in Australia. The penalty ordered by the Federal Court today is the highest penalty ever imposed for cartel conduct in Australia. The Court also imposed a $575,000 penalty on BlueScope’s former general manager, Jason Ellis, which by Court order cannot be recovered from an insurance company. From the ACCC's press release: Justice O’Bryan said that “the conduct in the present case warrants a significant penalty to deter repetition by Mr Ellis and by others who may otherwise calculate that the rewards from such conduct outweigh the risks of detection. It is important that the deterrent effect of the penalty being imposed is not undermined by the ability of company directors and officers to insure against the financial cost of the penalty.” In December 2022 the Court found that BlueScope and Mr Ellis had attempted to induce eight steel distributors in Australia, and an overseas manufacturer, Yieh Phui, to enter agreements to fix and/or raise the level of pricing for flat steel products. “This should serve as a strong warning to all businesses and individuals that attempting to fix prices with competitors will have very serious consequences, even if the attempt fails and they do not reach an agreement,” ACCC Commissioner Liza Carver said. “We welcome this substantial penalty against BlueScope. It is important that penalties are sufficiently large to deter even large companies and their employees from breaching Australia’s competition laws.” “Cartel conduct is illegal because it cheats Australians by increasing the prices consumers and business customers have to pay, and by restricting healthy economic growth,” Ms Carver said. “If BlueScope had been successful in reaching an agreement to fix prices with its competitors, this would have reduced price competition and increased prices for flat steel products which are widely used in the construction, manufacturing, automotive and transport industries.” Justice O’Bryan found that the conduct by BlueScope was deliberate and systematic and considered that “only a substantial penalty for each of the attempts to induce cartel conduct will serve the objectives of specific and general deterrence”. He found that the conduct by BlueScope was of a serious kind, was carried out at a senior level of the company, had the potential to occasion significant loss and damage and to deliver substantial financial gain to BlueScope. BlueScope and Mr Ellis were also ordered to pay the ACCC’s costs.",
