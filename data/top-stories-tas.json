Macquarie has also raised its fixed rates by 0.36 percentage points, with more hikes than cuts to fixed-rate loans over the last month, according to RateCity. RateCity says the big four banks' lowest fixed-rate mortgages are mainly above 6 per cent, with just two fixed rates under 6 per cent.

Just 5 per cent of new and refinanced loans are fixed, compared to nearly half in July 2021 when interest rates were at record lows.",
