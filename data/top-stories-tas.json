Mr Joyce said they couldn't go on for too much longer because they, ironically, had a plane to catch (which committee chair Senator Jane Hume quipped \"I'm sure it'll be delayed\" in response). Here's a quick recap of what we learned from that 90 minutes: Mr Joyce refused to share detail about Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's son being granted access to the Chairman's Lounge, or any other details about the lounge citing privacy reasons Jetstar CEO Steph Tully confirmed the budget airline is holding around $100 million worth of flight credits, on top of the $370 million worth of Qantas flight credits disclosed last week Mr Joyce did not disclose the value of flight credits held by international passengers, but said it was \"less than $100 million\" Neither Mr Joyce, Ms Tully or Mr McGuinness ruled out the possibility of the flight credit deadline being extended beyond December this year, but said a line in the sand needed to be drawn Qantas is aiming to have zero outstanding flight credits left by December 31 And with that, that brings the blog to close to another day. We will have a complete wrap up of the explosive hearing shortly, but until then, you can catch up on today's developments below, or download the ABC News app and subscribe to our range of news alerts for the latest news.",

Most sectors of the local market rose, led by consumer, health and energy. The major banks helped the broader market rise, with a 1.3 per cent gain for NAB shares. On the flipside, Fortescue shares were down 5.1 per cent, after it announced a drop in profit and the shock exit of its metals CEO. There was another CEO exit that sent shares tumbling — Sayona Mining shares hit a two-year low on news its boss was resigning. AI chipmaker Brainchip also saw shares slump as its half-year results disappointed investors.",
