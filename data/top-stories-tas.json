But behind the scenes, the league is looking into whether a referee has used a Twitter account to defend themself and other officials from online critiques. Eric Lewis, who had been chosen to officiate the finals in each of the last four NBA seasons, was not selected as one of the 12 referees for this year's finals. After some now-deleted tweets were revealed by a pair of Twitter users last week, the league opened an investigation into whether Lewis violated NBA rules by speaking about officiating in an unauthorised manner. It has not been determined if Lewis was using the account, which used the name \"blair cuttliff\". \"Regarding Eric Lewis and the social media posts, we are continuing to review the matter and he will not be working the finals,\" NBA spokesman Mike Bass says. It remains unknown what discipline from the league that Lewis could face if he broke policy by discussing officiating matters openly without approval.",

The Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) has asked for a 7% rise to match the most recent March quarter annual inflation figure. The federal government has supported a rise in line with inflation for Australia's lowest paid workers, i.e. those on the minimum wage. That leaves open scope for the FWC to do what it did last year and give workers on awards (there's roughly 2 million of them) a lower pay increase than those on the minimum wage (of which there are a couple of hundred thousand workers). Last year, the FWC gave minimum wage workers a 5.2% pay rise and award wage workers a 4.6% boost. An increase in line with inflation would lift the minimum wage by around $57 a week this year. However, employer groups have called for a much smaller increase to avoid the risk of rising wages creating an upwards spiral in prices and entrenching high inflation. The Australian Industry Group (AiGroup) called for a 3.8% increase in its submission to Fair Work, while the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry (ACCI) asked for a 3.5% rise. All employees will see a 0.5 percentage point rise in the compulsory superannuation guarantee level from 10.5 to 11% of their pay packet.",

              "plaintext": "Good morning, welcome to another day of market action. There was certainly some sighs of relief overnight on US markets after the House of Representatives passed the debt ceiling deal struck between President Joe Biden and congressional republicans led by Speaker Kevin McCarthy. The deal suspends the debt ceiling until January 1, 2025, in returns for some limits on spending that are estimated to save around $US1.5 trillion over a decade according to the Congressional Budget Office. That deal now looks likely to sail through the Senate, given the US government some breathing space before it threatens to run out of the ability to borrow money again at some point within the next couple of years. Some key economic data was also viewed positively in light of the upbeat sentiment from the debt deal. Private employment data stayed strong and jobless claims remained low but, despite this, wage increases in the US moderated, raising optimism that the Fed can skip a rate rise this month and may even be finished hiking. \"Unit labor cost data for the first quarter normally doesn't trigger a reaction. But it signaled a significant improvement,\" Edward Moya, senior market analyst at OANDA in New York, told Reuters. \"The market became confident that, 'wow the Fed rate hike for June is pretty much not happening ' and confidence is falling for raising rates for July.\" US manufacturing data, including around input costs, was also weak, further adding to the case that price pressures in the economy are easing. Futures are now pricing in a more than three-quarters chance of the Federal Reserve keeping rates on hold when it meets in a couple of weeks. The benchmark S & P 500 index rose 1% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq 1.3%, with both reaching nine-month highs, while the blue chip Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.5% to 33,062 points. Stay with me to see how the Australian share market reacts later this morning.",
