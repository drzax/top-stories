The Loafers Lodge hostel has a capacity for 92 guests, but it's unclear how many people were inside at the time of the fire, at around 12:30am local time. Police say their initial assessment \"is that the number of deceased is fewer than 10\". They say they are waiting to access and assess the building to confirm details. \"It is currently unsafe and until we can access the building — and reconcile numbers of people who are safe — we are not in a position to determine how many people are deceased or unaccounted for,\" police say. \"Our focus is on identifying those people as soon as we can.\"",

Vice says it has agreed to sell its assets to a consortium of lenders in exchange for $US225 ($336 million) million in credit. The company says its media brands will continue to produce content and keep paying its employees and vendors as the sale goes through in the new few months. In a statement, Vice co-CEOs Bruce Dixon and Hozefa Lokhandwala say the \"accelerated court-supervised sale process\" will strengthen the company and position it for long-term growth. They say it will safeguard \"the kind of authentic journalism and content creation that makes VICE such a trusted brand for young people and such a valued partner to brands, agencies and platforms\". Vice assets and liabilities are worth up to $1.5 billion, according to the bankruptcy filing. There has been a wider surge of media layoffs and closures in the US, including job cuts at Gannett, NPR, the Washington Post and other organisations. In April, BuzzFeed announced BuzzFeed News was being shut down as part of a cost-cutting drive by its corporate parent.",
