              "plaintext": "The Australian Taxation Office (ATO) is warning landlords that its expanded data-matching program means they are unlikely to get away with under-declaring income or making incorrect claims for deductions. The ATO now has more access to data from property managers, landlord insurance providers, income protection policies, financial institutions lending for investment properties, as well as sharing economy platforms. \"This isn't a game of Guess Who, as our sophisticated data-matching programs provide us with all the clues we need to track down taxpayers with incorrect information in their tax return,\" warned ATO assistant commissioner Tim Loh. \"We will use this information to identify and educate taxpayers who have made incorrect claims in their return, with a longer-term plan to pre-fill as much information as possible in future years.\" Mr Loh spoke with the ABC's Nassim Khadem about some things that people need to be aware of when they do their tax returns from July on. Mr Loh said an ATO review found nine out of 10 landlords were getting things wrong on their tax returns, especially around claiming interest deductions and not declaring landlord's insurance payouts as income. \"Around 80% of taxpayers with rental income claimed a deduction for interest on their loan, and this is where we're seeing mistakes,\" he noted. \"For example, you can't refinance an investment property to buy personal items, like a holiday to Europe or a Tesla, then continue to claim the interest expenses as a tax deduction.\" The ATO also reminded property owners that a new \"Sharing Economy Reporting Regime\" (SERR) coming into force on July 1 will mean that short-term accommodation booking and payment platforms will be disclosing financial information to the ATO, which it will compare with individual tax returns. \"These new rules will give the ATO clear visibility of people who are earning income using these platforms,\" Mr Lowe said. There are also substantial changes to work from home claims this financial year, which Nassim Khadem explains in this article.",

It now thinks the Reserve Bank will lift the official cash rate to 4.6 per cent, seeing possible rate increases of 0.25 per cent in both July and August. That's to curb high inflation and the risk of rising prices leading to more calls for higher wages. The NAB's economics team, led by chief economist, Alan Oster, expects the economy to pull back to its slowest pace since the 1990s recession. \"Taking rates to 4.6 per cent will weigh more heavily on growth and we have revised down our expectations for  growth over 2023 to just 0.5 per cent and pulled back expectations for 2024 to around 0.9 per cent.\" \"That sees  unemployment rise more quickly and reach 5 per cent by end 2024.\" \"We still see the RBA cutting interest rates back towards neutral in 2024 as a “forward-looking” central bank  sees the slowing in growth and unemployment rising.... and it becomes clearer inflation is returning to target.\"",
