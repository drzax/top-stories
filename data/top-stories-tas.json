                  "articleBody": "\"Why the f*** are you going to the King's coronation?\" \"Are you a Monarchist? Why go?\" \"The coronation. Seriously????\" These are just some of the messages Australian music icon Nick Cave has received since being announced as a guest for King Charles III's coronation this Saturday. So, the transgressive singer-songwriter has responded in a blog post as part of his The Red Hand Files series. Here's what he wrote ( with my favourite bits highlighted in bold ): Dear Jon, Adrian, Roger and Matt, I'll make this a quick one because I've got to work out what I am going to wear to the Coronation. I am not a monarchist, nor am I a royalist, nor am I an ardent republican for that matter; what I am also not is so spectacularly incurious about the world and the way it works, so ideologically captured, so damn grouchy, as to refuse an invitation to what will more than likely be the most important historical event in the UK of our age. Not just the most important, but the strangest, the weirdest. I once met the late Queen at an event at Buckingham Palace for 'Aspirational Australians living in the UK' (or something like that). It was a mostly awkward affair, but the Queen herself, dressed in a salmon coloured twin-set, seemed almost extraterrestrial and was the most charismatic woman I have ever met. Maybe it was the lighting, but she actually glowed. As I told my mother – who was the same age as the Queen and, like the Queen, died in her nineties – about that day, her old eyes filled with tears. When I watched the Queen's funeral on the television last year I found, to my bafflement, that I was weeping myself as the coffin was stripped of the crown, orb and sceptre and lowered through the floor of St. George's Chapel. I guess what I am trying to say is that, beyond the interminable but necessary debates about the abolition of the monarchy, I hold an inexplicable emotional attachment to the Royals – the strangeness of them, the deeply eccentric nature of the whole affair that so perfectly reflects the unique weirdness of Britain itself. I'm just drawn to that kind of thing – the bizarre, the uncanny, the stupefyingly spectacular, the awe-inspiring. And as for what the young Nick Cave would have thought – well, the young Nick Cave was, in all due respect to the young Nick Cave, young, and like many young people, mostly demented, so I'm a little cautious around using him as a benchmark for what I should or should not do. He was cute though, I'll give him that. Deranged, but cute. So, with all that in mind, I am looking forward to going the Coronation. I think I'll wear a suit. Love, Nick"

The 76ers centre lost the MVP award to Jokić in the past two seasons. If Jokić wins again, however, he would be the first player to win three consecutive MVP awards since Boston's Larry Bird (from 1984 to 1986). The award is decided by a panel of sportswriters and broadcasters, as well as fans. We'll bring you the announcement of the winner when it happens this morning."

After voting, Bahr quickly turns his camera off, leaving a black screen showing just his name. You can then see some people in the office trying not to laugh at his brief appearance. A GOP Senate spokeswoman said Bahr, a truck driver, worked until 4:45am on the day of the meeting, so we'll give him the benefit of the doubt. (Watch from 6:35)"

Seriously????\" These are just some of the messages Australian music icon Nick Cave has received since being announced as a guest for King Charles III's coronation this Saturday. So, the transgressive singer-songwriter has responded in a blog post as part of his The Red Hand Files series. Here's what he wrote ( with my favourite bits highlighted in bold ): Dear Jon, Adrian, Roger and Matt, I'll make this a quick one because I've got to work out what I am going to wear to the Coronation. I am not a monarchist, nor am I a royalist, nor am I an ardent republican for that matter; what I am also not is so spectacularly incurious about the world and the way it works, so ideologically captured, so damn grouchy, as to refuse an invitation to what will more than likely be the most important historical event in the UK of our age. Not just the most important, but the strangest, the weirdest. I once met the late Queen at an event at Buckingham Palace for 'Aspirational Australians living in the UK' (or something like that). It was a mostly awkward affair, but the Queen herself, dressed in a salmon coloured twin-set, seemed almost extraterrestrial and was the most charismatic woman I have ever met. Maybe it was the lighting, but she actually glowed. As I told my mother – who was the same age as the Queen and, like the Queen, died in her nineties – about that day, her old eyes filled with tears. When I watched the Queen's funeral on the television last year I found, to my bafflement, that I was weeping myself as the coffin was stripped of the crown, orb and sceptre and lowered through the floor of St. George's Chapel. I guess what I am trying to say is that, beyond the interminable but necessary debates about the abolition of the monarchy, I hold an inexplicable emotional attachment to the Royals – the strangeness of them, the deeply eccentric nature of the whole affair that so perfectly reflects the unique weirdness of Britain itself. I'm just drawn to that kind of thing – the bizarre, the uncanny, the stupefyingly spectacular, the awe-inspiring. And as for what the young Nick Cave would have thought – well, the young Nick Cave was, in all due respect to the young Nick Cave, young, and like many young people, mostly demented, so I'm a little cautious around using him as a benchmark for what I should or should not do. He was cute though, I'll give him that. Deranged, but cute. So, with all that in mind, I am looking forward to going the Coronation. I think I'll wear a suit. Love, Nick",

The 76ers centre lost the MVP award to Jokić in the past two seasons. If Jokić wins again, however, he would be the first player to win three consecutive MVP awards since Boston's Larry Bird (from 1984 to 1986). The award is decided by a panel of sportswriters and broadcasters, as well as fans. We'll bring you the announcement of the winner when it happens this morning.",

A senator in the US state of Minnesota has become a reluctant social media star after voting shirtless while lying in bed during a meeting. In a video streamed on YouTube ( which you can watch below from the 6:35 mark ), Republican Senator Calvin Bahr can briefly be seen voting during a Zoom call. After voting, Bahr quickly turns his camera off, leaving a black screen showing just his name. You can then see some people in the office trying not to laugh at his brief appearance. A GOP Senate spokeswoman said Bahr, a truck driver, worked until 4:45am on the day of the meeting, so we'll give him the benefit of the doubt. (Watch from 6:35)",

Seriously????\" These are just some of the messages Australian music icon Nick Cave has received since being announced as a guest for King Charles III's coronation this Saturday. So, the transgressive singer-songwriter has responded in a blog post as part of his The Red Hand Files series. Here's what he wrote ( with my favourite bits highlighted in bold ): Dear Jon, Adrian, Roger and Matt, I'll make this a quick one because I've got to work out what I am going to wear to the Coronation. I am not a monarchist, nor am I a royalist, nor am I an ardent republican for that matter; what I am also not is so spectacularly incurious about the world and the way it works, so ideologically captured, so damn grouchy, as to refuse an invitation to what will more than likely be the most important historical event in the UK of our age. Not just the most important, but the strangest, the weirdest. I once met the late Queen at an event at Buckingham Palace for 'Aspirational Australians living in the UK' (or something like that). It was a mostly awkward affair, but the Queen herself, dressed in a salmon coloured twin-set, seemed almost extraterrestrial and was the most charismatic woman I have ever met. Maybe it was the lighting, but she actually glowed. As I told my mother – who was the same age as the Queen and, like the Queen, died in her nineties – about that day, her old eyes filled with tears. When I watched the Queen's funeral on the television last year I found, to my bafflement, that I was weeping myself as the coffin was stripped of the crown, orb and sceptre and lowered through the floor of St. George's Chapel. I guess what I am trying to say is that, beyond the interminable but necessary debates about the abolition of the monarchy, I hold an inexplicable emotional attachment to the Royals – the strangeness of them, the deeply eccentric nature of the whole affair that so perfectly reflects the unique weirdness of Britain itself. I'm just drawn to that kind of thing – the bizarre, the uncanny, the stupefyingly spectacular, the awe-inspiring. And as for what the young Nick Cave would have thought – well, the young Nick Cave was, in all due respect to the young Nick Cave, young, and like many young people, mostly demented, so I'm a little cautious around using him as a benchmark for what I should or should not do. He was cute though, I'll give him that. Deranged, but cute. So, with all that in mind, I am looking forward to going the Coronation. I think I'll wear a suit. Love, Nick",

The previously announced finalists are: Giannis Antetokounmpo (Milwaukee Bucks) Joel Embiid (Philadelphia 76ers) Nikola Jokić (Denver Nuggets) Embiid appears to be the favourite this year, after leading the NBA in scoring for a second-straight season. The 76ers centre lost the MVP award to Jokić in the past two seasons. If Jokić wins again, however, he would be the first player to win three consecutive MVP awards since Boston's Larry Bird (from 1984 to 1986). The award is decided by a panel of sportswriters and broadcasters, as well as fans. We'll bring you the announcement of the winner when it happens this morning.",

A senator in the US state of Minnesota has become a reluctant social media star after voting shirtless while lying in bed during a meeting. In a video streamed on YouTube ( which you can watch below from the 6:35 mark ), Republican Senator Calvin Bahr can briefly be seen voting during a Zoom call. After voting, Bahr quickly turns his camera off, leaving a black screen showing just his name. You can then see some people in the office trying not to laugh at his brief appearance. A GOP Senate spokeswoman said Bahr, a truck driver, worked until 4:45am on the day of the meeting, so we'll give him the benefit of the doubt. (Watch from 6:35)",
