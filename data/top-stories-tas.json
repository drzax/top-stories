She points out that in November last year, RBA forecast inflation coming down to target by December 2024, but that shifted to June 2025 by February this year. Senator Hume notes Bullock has been reiterating RBA's low tolerance for inflation not coming down as quickly as they would like, and asks whether Bullock has been indicating that the RBA is pushing out its forecast again beyond late 2025. \"All I was trying to convey really was the same thing we've been conveying all along, which is the longer that inflation remains outside the target band. The more likely it is that inflation expectations might adjust to that,\" she says. \"So at the moment ... you're right forecasts have shifted out but we've judged that on balance. \" We think we can manage to slow the economy enough without actually putting it in a recession and an unnecessary increase in unemployment. \"And that if we can do it in that timeframe, we think that we can get it back and we can keep inflationary expectations under control. So that that's sort of where we where our judgment was. \"When I say low tolerance, we've always said we have a low tolerance. I don't think I've said anything new there. \"And when we go through our process of looking at our forecasts after after the most recent news, we'll again be making a judgment about how long do we think we can stay outside the band in thinking about what our what our monetary policy should be.\"",
