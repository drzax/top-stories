              "plaintext": "ANZ economists Brian Martin and Tom Kenny have put together a useful summary of the US debt ceiling debate and risks of default. They are a little more relaxed than Rabobank's global strategists, but only a little. Here are some highlights (or lowlights): \"The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projects that, if the debt limit remains unchanged, the government's ability to continue spending using extraordinary measures will be exhausted by early June. In that event, many government workers could not get paid, social security and other payments would be at risk and the Treasury would be unable to borrow. Recession risks would intensify sharply.\" Just how bad could it get? Very, according to recent forecasts. \"The consequences of a default would be disastrous. \" US Council of Economic Advisors (CEA) estimates a short default would cause a 0.3% rise in unemployment and 0.6% contraction in GDP. A protracted default would cause a 5.0% rise in unemployment and 6.1% fall in GDP. \"A default would also provoke a sharp rise in yields and wreak havoc in all financial markets and the real economy in the US and internationally.\" So what do the ANZ economists think will happen? \"We think the most likely scenarios are: 1. A longer-term agreement. We see a limited possibility (less than 10%) of a longer-term deal to lift or suspend the debt limit along the lines of the Republican bill. For now, the parties are too far apart and there is limited time in lawmakers' diaries to broker a deal before the X date. 2. A short-term compromise. We think a deal to suspend the debt limit by a few months is the most likely outcome (around 90%). This would be a similar outcome to what happened in October2021 when Democrats and Republicans agreed to increase the debt limit by USD480bn. This was said to be enough to provide funding till December 2021 or early January 2022. On 14 December 2021 the House and Senate passed a bill that saw the debt limit increased to its current level of USD31.4trn. 3. No agreement and the US defaults. According to the US Treasury this has never happened. Since 1960, Congress has acted 78 times to raise, temporarily extend or revise the definition of the debt limit. We think there is around a 1% chance of a default. A recent Chicago Fed paper claims Credit Default Swap (CDS) spreads data imply the probability of a default is 1%. This would likely be higher now, given that CDS spreads are a little higher compared to when the paper was published.\" So, the most likely outcome is another kick of the can down the road.",

The ASX 200 is on 7,241 points. Sound familiar? The only thing that could make it even more eerie is if it recovers late to finish slightly higher. The big drag on the market today are two ex-dividend big banks, ANZ and Macquarie, while NAB was the only major bank to trade higher. Resources companies are split. Take this example, gold miner Silver Lake Resources is one of the top gainers, up 7.4% to $1.09. Another company minus the \"silver\", Lake Resources (a lithium producer), is down 10% at $0.585. Despite its name, Silver Lake mines gold, and those producing the precious metal are generally trading strongly today, no doubt getting a boost from Newcrest's acceptance of a takeover by North American giant Newmont. Not only is that a sign of takeover interest in the sector that might spill over to other firms, but there is also talk that Newmont may want to split and sell-off some of Newcrest's non-core assets, potentially opening up buying opportunities. Rural services firm Elders was a notable mover, dropping 12.1%, or a dollar, to $7.30 after releasing its first-half profit results. No need to second guess what the market thought of its 42.4% slump in net profit to $48.8 million, which the company said was due to a \"volatile\" but also \"more normalised\" trading environment for agricultural commodities.",
