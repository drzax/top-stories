So over the year fuel prices increased as the fuel excise returned to its normal level. The fuel excise for petrol, diesel, and all other fuel and petroleum based products was halved for six months on March 30 2022 as a cost of living relief measure. That saw the rates for petrol and diesel fall from 44.2 cents to 22.1 cents a litre.

Higher petrol prices drove inflation higher in April, compared to the year before when the halving of the fuel tax excise was being unwound.
