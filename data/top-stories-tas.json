The latest Westpac-Melbourne Institute Consumer Sentiment measure for May fell 7.9 per cent. “The Melbourne Institute of Consumer Sentiment index fell by 7.9 per cent, from 85.8 in April to 79.0 in May,” Westpac Chief Economist, Bill Evans said. “The Index has fallen back to just above the dismal levels seen back in March, which recorded the lowest monthly read since the COVID outbreak in 2020 and, before that, since the deep recession of the early 1990s.” “The two key developments over the last month have been the surprise decision by the Reserve Bank Board to lift the cash rate by a further 0.25% in May and the Federal Budget.” The bank reports the sharpest drop in sentiment are among those on low incomes, renters, mortgagors and women. Interestingly, the crisis of confidence among renters is greater than those with a mortgage, despite the interest rate hikes. Most households expect interest rates to keep rising more here.",
