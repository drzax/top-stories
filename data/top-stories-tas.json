The Gold Coast man, 45, has been charged with 136 counts of rape and 110 counts of sexual intercourse with a child under 10. AFP Assistant Commissioner Justine Gough says the AFP and its partner agencies never gave up trying to identify the alleged offender and the children involved. \"Given there were so many alleged images and videos of children recorded over 15 years on the alleged offender's devices, the process of identification took time, skill and determination,\" she says. \"While I am extremely proud of law enforcements' persistence and their unwavering dedication to identify this alleged offender, and stop further abuse, this is chilling news. \"It is with a heavy heart that the AFP and other law enforcement dedicate so much time and resources to prevent and take action against individuals who commit heinous crimes against children. \"There is not much solace I can give parents and children who have been identified under Operation Tenterfield, but I can tell you that we never gave up, and we never will when it comes to protecting children. \"This is a distressing time for families, carers and the community broadly.\" You can read more on this story at the link below.

The value had fallen by 3.1% compared to the rate seen in May, but remains significantly higher than a year ago. The head of finance statistics for the ABS, Mish Tan, says the ongoing surge in refinancing is reflective of a higher interest rate environment. \"Refinancing activity has remained at record highs in recent months, as borrowers continued to switch lenders amid interest rate rises ,\" she said. \"The value of total refinancing between lenders was 12.6% higher in June compared to a year ago.\" The number of people taking out mortgages fell by 2.8% in June to a value of $15.9 billion, while investors taking out loans was up by 2.6% to $8.7 billion — however it is 15% lower than this time last year. There was also a 0.8% fall in first home buyers taking out mortgages in June. The ABS also noted that the number of loan commitments in June was around half of what was seen in January 2021 (which is when first home buyer lending peaked during the pandemic — only months after Philip Lowe first mentioned the RBA wasn't expecting to increase the cash rate for \"at least three years\").",

The world's largest rare earths producer outside of China says the US government has increased its funding from $120 million ($179 million) to about $258 million ($385 million) for the project. The Texas plant will serve both the US defence department and commercial customers. Lynas says the facility, which is expected to open in 2026, will be the only scale producer of separated heavy rare earths outside of China. Here's Lynas chief executive Amanda Lacaze: \"Our heavy rare earths separation plant will be the first of its kind outside China and will help establish a globally significant, safe and environmentally responsible rare earths supply chain.\" The deal is part of the US government's critical minerals strategy, which aims to diversify supply away from China, develop substitutes and improve reuse and recycling. Heavy rare earths are used in virtually every industry including for high-power magnets, fluorescent lighting, lasers, fibre-optic technology, and solar panels.",
