The period in early 2020 was incredibly scary, nd our mindset was to provide maximum support medical insurance to protect against the worst possible outcome, and we did that. \"It turned out we provided too much support and perhaps too much insurance and that's contributed to inflation problems now. \"We didn't fully understand the nature of the pandemic and how long it would last and what the implications would be for the economy. \"So I wish in retrospect that we'd been able to understand that in more detail, and if we would have, if we had a better understanding, then we would have responded differently. \"I remember being too being told that the unemployment rate was going to 15%, the vaccine wouldn't be for five years, maybe it wasn't effective, people could be forced to stay at home for years — it was incredibly scary and we responded with maximum insurance. \"It turned out the scientists did a much better job than anyone thought. We recovered quickly, we all got vaccinated, the vaccine worked and we back to pre-pandemic days. \"I wish I understood that and we would have had a different policy response.

Jean Carroll defamed him by accusing him of rape, after a jury awarded her $US5 million for defamation and sexual abuse but not rape. The former president has asked the federal appeals court in Manhattan to overturn an August 7 decision by US District Judge Lewis Kaplan that also rejected some of his defences in a second defamation lawsuit by Ms Carroll. Both cases stemmed from Mr Trump's denials that he raped Carroll in a Bergdorf Goodman department store dressing room in Manhattan in the mid-1990s. A trial in the second lawsuit is scheduled for January 15, 2024, but Mr Trump wants it put on hold during his separate appeal against Judge Kaplan's June 29 refusal to dismiss it. Ms Carroll's lawyers opposed that request, saying she had waited long enough, and the public would be \"poorly served\" by granting Mr Trump an \"effectively indefinite delay\".",
