First, let's take a look back at how we ended the week. It was actually the worst weekly performance by the ASX 200 so far this year and left us at around a 3-month low. And after we'd wrapped things up for the week, US markets ended lower on their Friday, with things unravelling into the close — the Dow lost 0.6 per cent. It followed some mixed signal on the US labour market — the closely watched non-farm payrolls report was actually weaker than expected. 209,000 jobs were added in June, the smallest rise in 2.5 years, and below expectations of a 225,000 gain. And the numbers for April and May were revised down by 110,000. However, average hourly earnings were stronger than had been forecast, and as a result, bets are still on for further rate increases in the US. Markets are pricing in around a 90 per cent chance of a rate hike when the Federal Reserve meets in late July. \"Payrolls was weaker than expected, though not 'weak' — with stronger-than-expected wage growth an offset in terms of how the Federal Reserve will perceive the overall data,\" write ANZ analysts Brian Martin and Daniel Hynes. \"While there are clear cracks appearing in the labour market, the US labour force participation rate has seen a slow grind higher.\" Stick with us to see how it all plays out on our market.",
