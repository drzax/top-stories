All five aboard the vessel were killed. Cameron became a deep-sea explorer in the 1990s while researching and making his Oscar-winning blockbuster Titanic, and is part owner of Triton Submarines, which makes submersibles for research and tourism. He is part of the small and close-knit submersible community, or Manned Underwater Vehicle (MUV) industry. When he heard, as many in the industry had shared, that OceanGate Inc was making a deep-sea submersible with a composite carbon fiber and titanium hull, Cameron said he was skeptical. \"I thought it was a horrible idea,\" Cameron told Reuters in a Zoom interview. \"I wish I'd spoken up, but I assumed somebody was smarter than me, you know, because I never experimented with that technology, but it just sounded bad on its face.\" The cause of the Titan's implosion has not been determined, but Cameron presumes the critics were correct in warning that a carbon fiber and titanium hull would enable delamination and microscopic water ingress, leading to progressive failure over time. Other experts in the industry and a whistle-blowing employee raised alarms in 2018, criticising OceanGate for opting against seeking certification and operating as an experimental vessel. OceanGate has not addressed queries about its decision to forgo certification from industry third parties. The US Coast Guard said the submersible appears to have imploded, but a conclusive investigation will take time.",

The passengers, who paid as much as $US250,000 ($360,000) each for the journey to 3,810 meters below the surface, are believed to have signed liability waivers. A CBS reporter who made the trip with OceanGate Expeditions in July 2022 reported that the waiver he signed mentioned the possibility of death three times on the first page alone. Reuters could not independently confirm the terms of OceanGate's waivers. OceanGate did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Waivers are not always ironclad, and it is not uncommon for judges to reject them if there is evidence of gross negligence or hazards that were not fully disclosed. \"If there were aspects of the design or construction of this vessel that were kept from the passengers or it was knowingly operated despite information that it was not suitable for this dive, that would absolutely go against the validity of the waiver,\" said personal injury attorney and maritime law expert Matthew Shaffer. OceanGate could argue it was not grossly negligent and that the waivers apply because they fully described the dangers inherent in plumbing the deepest reaches of the ocean in a submersible the size of a minivan. The degree of any potential negligence and how that might impact the applicability of the waivers will depend on the causes of the disaster, which are still under investigation. \"There are so many different examples of what families might still have claims for despite the waivers, but until we know the cause we can't determine whether the waivers apply,\" said personal injury lawyer Joseph Low. The families could not be reached on Thursday. It is possible none of them will sue. Reporting by Reuters",

Coalition, Labor and Greens senators claimed the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) had undermined their committee inquiry before it had effectively started. The Senate's economics references committee has been running an inquiry into ASIC enforcement since last year. But on Friday ASIC chairman Joe Longo told the Committee he rejected the interim report's findings and the statements made in Parliament. \" ASIC unequivocally rejects any assertion of obfuscating or obstructing,\" he said in his opening statement. He said ASIC had answered 104 out of 109 questions on notice relating to individual matters to assist the Committee. \"We have not refused to answer questions on these individual mattersâ¦.However, ASIC is a law enforcement agency, and as a law enforcement agency, like the AFP, ATO and other agencies, there are limits on what documents we can share,\" he said. \"We need to ensure that our current and future work is not adversely impacted through public disclosure of our investigative files, transcripts, and our legal advice,\" he added. Information about closed investigations could prejudice ASIC's related and future investigations. \"It can disclose ASIC's methods and legal advice and also adversely impact people who have assisted ASIC and, of course, unfairly prejudice people who have been the subject of our investigations,\" he said. He said ASIC has a strong record on insider trading prosecutions and rejected assertions to the inquiry that 'if you engage in insider trading in Australia you will get away with it'. \"Over the past three years we have commenced 33 insider trading investigations and have laid 29 charges against 9 individuals in relation to this conduct,\" he said. \"We have obtained six criminal convictions.\"",
