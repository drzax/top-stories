              "plaintext": "Law firm Phi Finney McDonald has today commenced a shareholder class action in the Supreme Court of Victoria against Medibank on behalf of shareholders, in relation to the company’s recent data breach. From its press release just now: From market close on 19 October 2022 when Medibank went into a trading halt, to 26 October 2022 when the suspension was lifted, Medibank’s share price dropped more than 18 per cent after details of the breach were released. Phi Finney McDonald’s class action alleges that Medibank engaged in misleading and deceptive conduct and breached its continuous disclosure obligations in relation to the adequacy of its privacy and information security protections. The class action seeks compensation for shareholders that suffered losses as a result of Medibank’s alleged disclosure failures. It is separate to the privacy litigation brought by Medibank customers whose personal and health information was breached. Cameron Myers, Principal Lawyer at Phi Finney McDonald, said that following a preliminary investigation the firm considers there are grounds for legal action against the health insurer. “Medibank’s customers and shareholders quite rightly expected the company, as one of Australia’s largest private health insurers, to take adequate steps to protect the incredibly sensitive information that it held. Indeed, Medibank fostered this belief by informing the market that it had appropriate protections in place.” “The market was clearly concerned about the distress and related impact on customers whose data had been accessed, and what that meant for company costs and revenue. Based on our preliminary investigations, we believe that Medibank shareholders are entitled to be compensated for losses suffered from the erosion of trust and confidence in Medibank once the true state of affairs was acutely exposed.”",

              "plaintext": "The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) has issued 38 interim stop orders that relate to 67 pet insurance products issued by the The Hollard Insurance Company and PetSure. The stop orders relate to pet insurance products issued by the insurance via brands including: Woolworths RSPCA Petbarn Guide Dogs Medibank Bpua HCF The interim orders prohibit the insurers from engaging in retail product distribution in respect of the products for new customers. The orders are valid for 21 days unless revoked earlier. ASIC made the interim orders to protect consumers from acquiring pet insurance products that may not be consistent with their objectives, financial situation or needs. ASIC has issued the stop orders because of deficiencies in the target market determinations (TMD) for the products. The regulator says it's considering more stop orders for other insurance products. ASIC says it was concerned that the insurers did not appear to properly consider whether the key terms, features and attributes of the products would be consistent with the objectives, financial situation and needs of consumers in the target market. In particular, in defining the target market, it appears that the insurers did not properly consider the requirement for consumers to pay for veterinary expenses in full and upfront before receiving a partial reimbursement under a claim. ASIC says it expects the insurers to consider the concerns raised regarding the TMDs and take immediate steps to ensure compliance. It will consider making a final order if the concerns are not addressed in a timely manner. The insurers will have an opportunity to make submissions before a decision is made about any final stop orders.",
