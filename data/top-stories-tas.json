              "plaintext": "New Zealand's consumer inflation came in slightly above expectations in the June quarter, pushing out the market's expectations for when the central bank might start cutting the cash rate. Consumer prices rose 6% in the year to June (slower than the 6.7% annualised increase in the March quarter), Statistics New Zealand said in a statement on Wednesday. It's now below the three-decade high of 7.3% inflation seen in the June quarter of 2022. Measured another way, the consumer price index (CPI) rose 1.1% between the March and June quarters. This result was just above economists’ expectations in a Reuters poll for a 1% rise for the quarter and a 5.9% annual rise. Inflation is a significant challenge for the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) and it has responded by raising interest rates to 5.5% from a record low 0.25% in October 2021. While it has said it now believes that the rate increases are having the desired impact on dampening inflation, it expects rates to hold at a \"restrictive level\" for the foreseeable future. The main drivers of the annual inflation were food and housing prices, according to Statistics New Zealand. \"With food prices up 12.3% annually, consumers may be buying cheaper alternative to keep their food bill lower,\" said Nicola Growden, the prices senior manager at Statistics New Zealand. \"The price of building a new home has increased by more than a third in the three years from the June 2020 quarter.\"",

Most sectors have risen, with energy being the best performing sector thanks to gains from Ampol (+5.1%), Whitehaven Coal (+2.9%) and Coronado Global Resources (+4%). Ampol reported a 54% drop in first-half refining margins at its Lytton refinery in Queensland, impacted by a five-week long outage at the plant. Meanwhile, shares BrainChip jumped 9.5% after the AI firm the US Patents and Trademarks Office approved its patent for a \"neuromorphic processor\". On the flip side, shares of gold miner Northern Star Resources have plunged 5.8%. That's despite the company forecasting higher gold sales in the current financial year, and after it reported a 6% jump in its fourth-quarter sales.",
