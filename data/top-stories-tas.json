The Yes campaign are trying to convince the country that the prime minister, state premiers and peak organisations cannot reduce and close the gap, but an advisory body that meets a few times a year in Canberra is going to be able to do it.\" The Drum Hobart special broadcast airs at 6pm AEDT",

In his pitch, he spoke of the longstanding relationship between Muslims and First Australians â€” forged between YolÅ‹u from North East Arnhem Land and traders from Makassar â€” before European colonisation. Mr Albanese asked the hundreds at the Lakemba Mosque for regular Friday prayers to \"appeal to our better angles\". \"This referendum won't be decided by politicians, it will be decided by everyone in this room above 18,\" he said. Mr Albanese also claimed that regardless of progressive or conservative arguments for the No vote, it would leave the country stuck in addressing disadvantage. \"There is no progressive Yes or progressive No,\" he said. \"Voting No leaves us nowhere. No recognition. No way forward.\" Alongside the PM, president of the Australian National Imams Council, Sheikh Shady Alsuleiman, called on fellow Muslims to vote Yes. \"We are committed to the Voice and we will say Yes to the Voice,\" he said. \"Inshallah, on October 15 we will wake up and every single Australian will see the success of the Voice.\" The Labor Party is working hard to grow the Yes vote among multicultural and diverse communities. Yesterday Indigenous Affairs Minister Linda Burney addressed a group of about 100 older Chinese Australians, with her speech translated into Mandarin and Cantonese.",
