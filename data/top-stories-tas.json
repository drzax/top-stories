Here's what they see: Holding Tight: in terms of global inflation coming down and the end of central bank rate hikes, BlackRock's Asia-Pacific chief investment strategist Ben Powell says \"we are not there yet.\" He says central banks won't start to reduce interest rates anytime soon because supply constraints remain high, which is keeping services inflation higher. Mr Powell says it would be \"expensive mistake\" for central banks to declare victory over inflation too early. \"If you re-raise that can cost you years of credibility.\" \"With inflation, yes again, it's come down, that's great, that's important, we're hopefully on the right path, but we're just not there yet so declaring victory too soon would be a mistake.\" He says high interest rates have returned and the period of low interest rates was likely an aberration. And Mr Powell doesn't rule out the risk of a global recession because of high interest rates slowing economic growth. \"In the recent weeks....there has been more hope around no landing.\" \"We still think there is going to be a landing over the next several quarters caused by the long and variable lags of interest rate policy.\" \"It still seems likely to us that taking interest rates, say in the US, up by 500 basis points from the old regime to the new regime from an unbelievably low level by historical standards to a much higher level frankly has some consequences.\" But Mr Powell doesn't want to use the R-word. He sees \"an economic outlook a little bit more negative than the current market expectation.\"",
