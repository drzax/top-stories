Ian Todd and his colleague Jordan Allely visited an address in the town to follow up reports of a minor disturbance at the local supermarket. SA Police say a man at the address confronted the officers and stabbed them, before they shot and killed him. Commissioner Stevens says a neighbour in the street helped police officers after the stabbings, providing \"absolutely critical support\". \"I can't convey my gratitude to that person enough,\" he says. \"The fact that they were prepared to step in, in very uncertain circumstances, potentially put their own life at risk to help the police, is a testament to the type of community we have in South Australia, particularly in regional South Australia where it is a very strong community.\" Stevens says Jordan Allely is now \"recovering well\", and Ian Todd had surgery overnight. \"We're still waiting to see what the outcome of that procedure will be,\" he says. \"His family are with him and all obviously of our best wishes are with him and his family. \"As you can appreciate, this type of thing it doesn't just rest with the two police officers directly involved, it affects all of their colleagues and the people who had to respond — and that includes the emergency service workers from SA ambulance as well.\""

The investigation may answer questions about how Bolsonaro, a strident coronavirus skeptic who vowed never to get a COVID vaccine, was registered as vaccinated in health records made public in February. A person familiar with the probe said federal police found evidence of tampering with Bolsonaro's vaccine records in his last weeks as president in late December, before he flew to the United States, where most foreign visitors must be vaccinated. Bolsonaro confirmed the raid on his home in Brasilia to journalists and reiterated that he had never taken a COVID vaccine. He denied any role in allegedly forging documents. \"For my part, there was nothing falsified. I didn't take the vaccine. Period,\" he said."

For the first time, scientists have caught a star in the act of swallowing a planet — in one big gulp. Astronomers report seeing what appears to be a gas giant around the size of Jupiter being eaten by its star. The Sun-like star had supposedly been expanding in its old age, and finally got so big that it ate up the close-orbiting planet. It's a gloomy preview of what will happen to Earth when our Sun morphs into a red giant and gobbles the four inner planets — but don't worry, that's billions of years away. Scientists say this newly recorded planetary snack happened between 10,000 and 15,000 years ago near the Aquila constellation, when the star was about 10 billion years old. As the planet was swallowed, there was apparently a hot outburst of light, followed by a long-lasting stream of bright dust. While there have been previous signs of other stars nibbling at planets, this was the first time the swallow itself was observed, according to the study appearing in the journal Nature. Massachusetts Institute of Technology researcher Kishalay De is said to have spotted the luminous outburst in 2020 while reviewing sky scans taken by the California Institute of Technology's Palomar Observatory. But it took additional observations and data-crunching to unravel the mystery."

                  "articleBody": "The US Federal Reserve has reinforced its fight against high inflation by raising its key interest rate to roughly 5.1 per cent — the highest level in 16 years. But it has also signalled that it might now pause its streak of 10 rate hikes. Still, the Fed has made it clear that it doesn't think its string of rate hikes have sufficiently cooled the US economy, the job market and inflation. US inflation has dropped from a peak of 9.1 per cent in June to 5 per cent in March but remains well above the Fed's 2 per cent target rate. US Fed Chair Jerome Powell says he believes the US has a greater chance to avoiding a recession than falling into one, in part because wages are moderating to a more sustainable level. But he told a news conference he would not rule out a recession, adding: \"It's possible that we will have what I hope would be a mild recession.\""

To be eligible for the rock hall, artists must have released their first commercial recording at least 25 years before they're eligible for induction.

Jean Carroll's claims that the former US president raped her in the mid-1990s. Trump lawyer Joseph Tacopina said they decided not to put on a defence case after learning that health issues were preventing their expert witness, a psychiatrist, from testifying. Tacopina had previously said that Trump would not testify at the trial himself. Carroll's lawyers say they could finish presenting their case on Thursday. They listed five remaining witnesses, including a former People magazine writer who says Trump pinned her against a wall and forcibly kissed her at his Mar-a-Lago mansion in Florida in 2005 — an allegation he denies. They also plan on playing excerpts of a sworn deposition that Trump gave in connection with Carroll's lawsuit, as well as a the 2005 Access Hollywood tape in which Trump boasted about grabbing women's genitals. Trump denies ever touching women against their will and has said that Carroll's claims are politically motivated attempts to smear his reputation and deny him a return to the White House. His lawyers have attacked Carroll's credibility through cross-examination, questioning why she didn't scream out for help during the alleged attack and why she never went to police. Reporting by AP"

Ian Todd and his colleague Jordan Allely visited an address in the town to follow up reports of a minor disturbance at the local supermarket. SA Police say a man at the address confronted the officers and stabbed them, before they shot and killed him. Commissioner Stevens says a neighbour in the street helped police officers after the stabbings, providing \"absolutely critical support\". \"I can't convey my gratitude to that person enough,\" he says. \"The fact that they were prepared to step in, in very uncertain circumstances, potentially put their own life at risk to help the police, is a testament to the type of community we have in South Australia, particularly in regional South Australia where it is a very strong community.\" Stevens says Jordan Allely is now \"recovering well\", and Ian Todd had surgery overnight. \"We're still waiting to see what the outcome of that procedure will be,\" he says. \"His family are with him and all obviously of our best wishes are with him and his family. \"As you can appreciate, this type of thing it doesn't just rest with the two police officers directly involved, it affects all of their colleagues and the people who had to respond — and that includes the emergency service workers from SA ambulance as well.\"",

The investigation may answer questions about how Bolsonaro, a strident coronavirus skeptic who vowed never to get a COVID vaccine, was registered as vaccinated in health records made public in February. A person familiar with the probe said federal police found evidence of tampering with Bolsonaro's vaccine records in his last weeks as president in late December, before he flew to the United States, where most foreign visitors must be vaccinated. Bolsonaro confirmed the raid on his home in Brasilia to journalists and reiterated that he had never taken a COVID vaccine. He denied any role in allegedly forging documents. \"For my part, there was nothing falsified. I didn't take the vaccine. Period,\" he said.",

For the first time, scientists have caught a star in the act of swallowing a planet — in one big gulp. Astronomers report seeing what appears to be a gas giant around the size of Jupiter being eaten by its star. The Sun-like star had supposedly been expanding in its old age, and finally got so big that it ate up the close-orbiting planet. It's a gloomy preview of what will happen to Earth when our Sun morphs into a red giant and gobbles the four inner planets — but don't worry, that's billions of years away. Scientists say this newly recorded planetary snack happened between 10,000 and 15,000 years ago near the Aquila constellation, when the star was about 10 billion years old. As the planet was swallowed, there was apparently a hot outburst of light, followed by a long-lasting stream of bright dust. While there have been previous signs of other stars nibbling at planets, this was the first time the swallow itself was observed, according to the study appearing in the journal Nature. Massachusetts Institute of Technology researcher Kishalay De is said to have spotted the luminous outburst in 2020 while reviewing sky scans taken by the California Institute of Technology's Palomar Observatory. But it took additional observations and data-crunching to unravel the mystery.",

But it has also signalled that it might now pause its streak of 10 rate hikes. Still, the Fed has made it clear that it doesn't think its string of rate hikes have sufficiently cooled the US economy, the job market and inflation. US inflation has dropped from a peak of 9.1 per cent in June to 5 per cent in March but remains well above the Fed's 2 per cent target rate. US Fed Chair Jerome Powell says he believes the US has a greater chance to avoiding a recession than falling into one, in part because wages are moderating to a more sustainable level. But he told a news conference he would not rule out a recession, adding: \"It's possible that we will have what I hope would be a mild recession.\"",

To be eligible for the rock hall, artists must have released their first commercial recording at least 25 years before they're eligible for induction.

Jean Carroll's claims that the former US president raped her in the mid-1990s. Trump lawyer Joseph Tacopina said they decided not to put on a defence case after learning that health issues were preventing their expert witness, a psychiatrist, from testifying. Tacopina had previously said that Trump would not testify at the trial himself. Carroll's lawyers say they could finish presenting their case on Thursday. They listed five remaining witnesses, including a former People magazine writer who says Trump pinned her against a wall and forcibly kissed her at his Mar-a-Lago mansion in Florida in 2005 — an allegation he denies. They also plan on playing excerpts of a sworn deposition that Trump gave in connection with Carroll's lawsuit, as well as a the 2005 Access Hollywood tape in which Trump boasted about grabbing women's genitals. Trump denies ever touching women against their will and has said that Carroll's claims are politically motivated attempts to smear his reputation and deny him a return to the White House. His lawyers have attacked Carroll's credibility through cross-examination, questioning why she didn't scream out for help during the alleged attack and why she never went to police. Reporting by AP",

Ian Todd and his colleague Jordan Allely visited an address in the town to follow up reports of a minor disturbance at the local supermarket. SA Police say a man at the address confronted the officers and stabbed them, before they shot and killed him. Commissioner Stevens says a neighbour in the street helped police officers after the stabbings, providing \"absolutely critical support\". \"I can't convey my gratitude to that person enough,\" he says. \"The fact that they were prepared to step in, in very uncertain circumstances, potentially put their own life at risk to help the police, is a testament to the type of community we have in South Australia, particularly in regional South Australia where it is a very strong community.\" Stevens says Jordan Allely is now \"recovering well\", and Ian Todd had surgery overnight. \"We're still waiting to see what the outcome of that procedure will be,\" he says. \"His family are with him and all obviously of our best wishes are with him and his family. \"As you can appreciate, this type of thing it doesn't just rest with the two police officers directly involved, it affects all of their colleagues and the people who had to respond — and that includes the emergency service workers from SA ambulance as well.\"",

For the first time, scientists have caught a star in the act of swallowing a planet — in one big gulp. Astronomers report seeing what appears to be a gas giant around the size of Jupiter being eaten by its star. The Sun-like star had supposedly been expanding in its old age, and finally got so big that it ate up the close-orbiting planet. It's a gloomy preview of what will happen to Earth when our Sun morphs into a red giant and gobbles the four inner planets — but don't worry, that's billions of years away. Scientists say this newly recorded planetary snack happened between 10,000 and 15,000 years ago near the Aquila constellation, when the star was about 10 billion years old. As the planet was swallowed, there was apparently a hot outburst of light, followed by a long-lasting stream of bright dust. While there have been previous signs of other stars nibbling at planets, this was the first time the swallow itself was observed, according to the study appearing in the journal Nature. Massachusetts Institute of Technology researcher Kishalay De is said to have spotted the luminous outburst in 2020 while reviewing sky scans taken by the California Institute of Technology's Palomar Observatory. But it took additional observations and data-crunching to unravel the mystery.",
