              "plaintext": "Here is a note from RBC Capital Markets analyst Owen Birrell on today's ACCC announcement about the alliance between Qantas and China Eastern. Qantas' ‘partnership’ with China Eastern was originally authorised in 2015 (with conditions), during a period of substantial growth in inbound Australia-China seat capacity. It was re-authorised in 2021 without conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic. In Mar-23, the ACCC granted interim authorisation to enable Qantas and China Eastern to continue to coordinate their operations while the ACCC assesses their substantive application for re-authorisation. An ‘Extended Joint Coordination Agreement’ is essentially a ‘revenue sharing’ partnership at delivers better economic outcomes than the traditional ‘code sharing’ alliances, as it enables carriers to circumvent certain competition laws through coordination of aircraft and schedules, delivering improved pricing outcomes (vs. rivals). The ACCC will generally authorise these agreements only if the public benefits from the coordination outweigh the harm to competition. The ACCC considers that demand for air travel between Australia and China is likely to keep growing but is unconvinced that the coordination of services between Qantas and China Eastern will lead to additional services. In the current environment of limited global capacity and heightened ticket pricing, we note the rising risk that a similar argument could be made by the ACCC in reference to Qantas' other ‘partnership-style’ arrangements as they come due, namely with Emirates (due 2026) and American Airlines (due 2026).",

The broader Topix rose 1.3 per cent to 2,436 and is on course to post a 3.3 per cent weekly gain. \"First of all, the market rose because Wall Street was strong,\" said Shoichi Arisawa, general manager of the investment research department at IwaiCosmo Securities. \"And the strong debut of Arm has raised investor sentiment and prompted them to buy chip-related shares.\" US stocks ended sharply higher overnight as robust economic data failed to budge expectations that the Federal Reserve will leave its key interest rate unchanged next week. Adding to positive sentiment, SoftBank Group's Arm was valued at nearly $US60 billion in a strong Nasdaq debut overnight, with the chip designer's shares soaring nearly 25 per cent in their first day of trading. Shares in SoftBank Group rose as much as 5 per cent earlier in the session but trimmed most of their gains to end the morning session up 1.7 per cent.",
