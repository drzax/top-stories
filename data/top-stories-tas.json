The group activated an emergency beacon at 1:30am, and the Australian Maritime Safety Authority requested the assistance of a nearby vehicle carrier along with the Cairns-based Challenger Rescue Aircraft.

That's after a review of the state's energy transition recommended the government discuss delaying the closure because of concerns about as shortfall in electricity supply. NSW Premier Chris Minns has told ABC News Breakfast that it's too early to say the cost to taxpayers to keep the plant open for longer. \"This is a really narrow and tricky path to follow. I can't give you a quantum or amount that will be paid to Eraring because those commercial discussions have only just begun or will be about to begin.\" Former NSW Energy Minister Matt Kean has claimed it could cost up to $1 billion a year to keep Eraring open. But according to documents filed with the NSW Parliament, Origin Energy told the former NSW government in July 2021 that keeping the ageing plant partially open would cost taxpayers about $70 million a year. Origin said the plant was a \"bottomless pit\" and its preference was to close the plant by the middle of the decade. \"Eraring is loss-making now, and we expect that to worsen over the decade, even with careful cost management,\" Origin said in a presentation to the government in July 2021. Here's more from energy reporter Dan Mercer and Kit Mochan.",

The decision is at the heart of a political storm with the government accused of protecting Qantas, with critics saying that allowing more international flights will reduce airfares. Senators voted 32 to 31 to establish an inquiry examining the impacts of the Qatar Airways decision, including the cost of flights. But Treasurer Jim Chalmers has told RN Breakfast that the government has no intention of reviewing the decision, and the \"decision was the right one, taken in the usual way.\" \"The aviation sector is expanding, international flights are expanding and what I'm trying to tell you is that different transport ministers, not just Minister King (Catherine King), Minister McCormack under the other government, from time to time decisions are taken not to proceed with these kind of outcomes between countries.\" \"It's not actually that unusual.\" Shadow transport minister Brigid McKenzie says the inquiry will examine why the decision was made. \"I think it's been clear over the last couple of weeks in particular that Australians have a lot of questions about why this government keeps making decisions that keep airfares high and cancellations and delays in the wrong direction.\" Meanwhile, it was a dramatic day yesterday with Qantas boss Alan Joyce stepping down early, replaced by Vanessa Hudson who has pledged to put customers first.
