Yes, Philip Lowe was receiving around $1 million in year as RBA governor. The RBA's annual report in 2022 showed Mr Lowe had a base salary of $890,252 a year. He also received $115,171 in superannuation contributions. On top of other benefits, he earned a total of $1,037,709 in the 2021-22 financial year. Given Ms Bullock's wealth of experience, which is very similar to Mr Lowe's, we can expect her to be receiving a similar amount when she takes over in September.",

My impression is that she is a more natural communicator than Philip Lowe, who always came across as slightly awkward in public appearances, even though he was very willing to engage with the media, including through informal one-on-one conversations and appearing at the Walkley business journalism lunch and National Press Club events. My colleague Peter Ryan has a similar impression of Bullock from his interactions with her: \"In my experience, Michele Bullock is approachable, a top communicator and committed to driving the economy in the right direction. \"I recall several years ago when the RBA released a research paper on the declining use of cash, I requested a briefing from the authors expecting no one would be available. \"Instead Ms Bullock got back to me on the phone and agreed to come to the ABC studios to be interviewed the next morning on AM â not arriving in a Commonwealth car with fanfare but in a regular tax with her laptop in a backpack.\" Bullock's speaking skills will be tested as the bank faces increased transparency after previous communications missteps, with a press conference to follow every board meeting starting next year. However, it's clear that her appointment is \"steady as she goes\" and is unlikely to mark a radical departure from Lowe's tenure. More from Peter Ryan : \"Michele Bullock is known to be close to Philip Lowe and long-regarded as a protÃ©gÃ©. Effectively Ms Bullock has been 'a heartbeat away' from the top role for some time and known to be one of Philip Lowe's key confidantes. \"In essence, Ms Bullock mirrors Philip Lowe to a large extent. \"Like Mr Lowe's she's an inflation hawk and recently provided a reality check stating the unemployment rate might need to rise to 4.5 per cent by the end of the year to get inflation back towards the 2 to 3 per cent target. \"Importantly, this appointment provides certainty locally and also globally that an RBA veteran is at the control to implement the recommendations from the Reserve Bank Review, many of which will be difficult.\" Another thing that Bullock has in common with Lowe is that they're both country NSW kids who ended up as RBA \"lifers\", ultimately making it to the top in Australia's financial capital at the central bank's HQ in Martin Place, Sydney.",

But with the changeover of governors in September, that doesn't mean we will magically see a change in how the RBA approaches interest rates. As deputy RBA governor, Michele Bullock has been involved in all the board meetings that have decided to increase the cash rate, and the communications we've frequently heard about how \"more monetary policy tightening may be needed\" (aka, more rate rises). Just on Wednesday, we heard Lowe say more rate rises might be necessary in the coming months to drive down inflation. Whether that happens before Lowe's tenure ends in September, or it happens when Bullock's begins, we will have to wait and see â and there is certainly a lot of economic data to be released and digested before that happens. (For what it's worth in the short-term, ANZ is now expecting interest rates will remain on hold at 4.1 per cent for a while longer âbut this was released before Bullock's appointment was announced.
