Mining stocks weighed from mid-session as iron ore futures turned negative — BHP (-1.1%), Rio Tinto (-1.1%) and Fortescue (-2pc) all went from gains to losses. And the major banks also ended in the red, giving up early gains, while gold miners remained a bright spot. By the close of trade, all sectors were lower, except for education and industrials. The biggest moves on the benchmark index were: Bottom 5 Imugene: -4.3% Tabcorp: -3.6% South32: -2.7% Magellan Financial: -2.7% A2 Milk: -2.3% Top 5: Bellevue Gold: +5.1% Monadelphous: +4% De Grey Mining: +3.4% Regis Resources: +3.1% Silver Lake Resources: +3.1% The Aussie dollar also pulled back, after economic data out of China raised concerns about its post-COVID recovery. Join us on the markets blog bright and early tomorrow for all the overnight market action, plus some local news out mid-morning in the form of Westpac consumer confidence and the NAB business survey. In the meantime, you can watch The Business at 8:45pm AEST on the ABC News Channel or anytime on iView — tonight the show will look at calls for tougher regulation on businesses abusing their market power, the economic challenges facing China and what's ahead for US earnings season.
