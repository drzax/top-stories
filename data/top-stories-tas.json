              "plaintext": "The ASX 200 has defied a negative lead from Wall Street to close higher, despite widespread bets of a Reserve Bank cash rate increase on November 7. The benchmark index finished up 0.2% at 6,827 points. The latest odds (via Refinitiv) of an increase to the cash rate on the first Tuesday in November were 56%, having fluctuated wildly during the week on economic data and two appearances by the new RBA governor Michele Bullock. Perhaps the prospect of higher rates contributed to a bad day for the local tech sector which, along with healthcare and education, posted the biggest declines. The best gains came from two sectors relatively unaffected by interest rates and the consumer cut backs associated with rate rises — consumer non-cyclicals and utilities. Coles was a solid contributor to that gain for consumer essentials stocks, up 2.1% to $15.29 as the market digested its sales results released yesterday. Harvey Norman surprised the market with a first quarter sales update today, and it wasn't a pleasant one. Sales were off more than 9 per cent and foot traffic in its stores down more than double that as consumers cut back in response to the rising cost of living and interest payments. Despite this, Harvey Norman shares ended 4.8% higher at $3.72 after the company said it would buy back up to 10 per cent of its shares. The other top gainers today were: Silver Lake Resources +7.7% to $1.05 Champion Iron +6.9% to $6.94 Alumina Ltd +5.2% to $0.81 Coronado Global Resources +3.8% to $1.765 The biggest losers on the ASX 200 were: Brambles Ltd -5.7% to $13.19 Healius Ltd -4.9% to $1.835 Steadfast Group -4.3% to $5.35 Resmed -4% to $21.56 AUB Group -3.4% to $26.57 And that's it from me for this week, but I'll be back on the blog on Monday morning. Catch you then.",

He's done the figures, which he used to do in government, and he worked for both sides and he said the net gain in the immigration in Australia this year is 500,000 people. And what do you say? Well, let's, let's assume they're couples. That's 250,000. RM: Yeah. NM: And we're building 175,000 houses. RM: And there's our problem. Now, just to be fair though, we lost something like 600,000 people out of the country through the COVID period. So we're not … NM: It's catch-up. RM: Yeah, it's catch-up, but it is showing the issue that if we want to keep growing this country — which I think we do need to keep growing this country — we need housing. NM: But nobody can tell me what the correct growth rate is. Nobody can tell me, and I don't think anybody's even assessing, what the correct immigration rate is. This was his point, he said it used to be about 130[000], maybe 150[000] to 170[000] is right. RM: Yeah. NM: 500[000] isn't. RM: No. NM: But we don't know. RM: But that 500[000] is a lot of catch-up and we did need to have a catch-up because we couldn't find people in small-medium sized businesses to work. If you got out into the agricultural sector, they were struggling to get people out onto the farms and the orchards and the like, so we needed to catch up and get those people back in. I think we're pretty well getting close to that. Now we need to work through what is the right immigration level for this country. Later in the interview, Mr McEwen also acknowledged that migration was keeping Australia out of recession, with per capita GDP going backwards for the past two quarters. \"You've also got to go back to the point of immigration is very helpful at a time of when things are slowing down, because whoever comes into the country, they need somewhere to live, they probably need transport. They use all the things you and I do. That keeps an economy going.\"",

              "plaintext": "Left-of-centre think tank The Australia Institute is hosting a revenue summit in Canberra today. Unsurprisingly, given the hosts, the key theme of the summit was the urgent need to raise more revenue to pay for government services. Probably the most interesting speaker was former finance department boss Michael Keating (no relation to former PM Paul). He says Australia needs to dramatically increase its tax take, rather than cut it (as will happen when the already legislated stage three income tax cuts take effect next July). \"Even if Australia increased its taxation revenue by as much as another 4% of GDP, as I've suggested is needed, I contend that that would not harm economic growth. \"Taxation in Australia would still only be raising about the same amount of revenue relative to GDP as the OECD average, and Australian taxation would still be lower than in Canada and the UK.\" And here's how he thinks it could be done. \"First: a high priority would be to rely more on those taxes which improve efficiency, such as a carbon tax, congestion charging and substituting a land tax for stamp duty. \"Second: Australia raises relatively little from its GST compared to other countries. [It] would be possible and arguably desirable to raise more by a combination of broadening the GST tax base and raising the GST tax rate. \"Third: resource rent tax. So the community shares some of the super profits that mining companies can make due to fortuitous circumstances not from their own effort or initiative. \"Fourth: the avoidance of company tax has become an industry. As I said, I'm not an expert, but urge close consideration of Ross Garnaut's proposal to substitute a tax on corporate cash flows for the present company tax. \"Fifth: loopholes in the personal income tax system, such as inadequate rate of capital gains taxation and negative gearing should similarly be closed. \"Sixth, and finally, we need more progressive income tax rates. The starting point should be to at least adjust the stage three tax cuts .\" If you don't know what the stage three tax cuts are, I did a handy primer video earlier this year with Angelique Lu. That last proposal also got support from independent MPs Monique Ryan and Dai Le. \"For the government, they really can't go ahead with it, shouldn't go ahead with it,\" said Dai Le, the member for Fowler, a traditionally Labor electorate in south-west Sydney. \"And think about it, especially for a Labor government by the way. Labor is supposed to be for the working Australians, right?\" Ms Ryan, who defeated previous treasurer Josh Frydenberg in the wealthy Melbourne electorate of Kooyong, may not be popular with some of her high-income constituents for also backing the wind-back of stage three. \"The 2019 stage three tax cuts were a booby trap for our economy,\" she argued. \"Led by Malcolm Turnbull, and by Scott Morrison and Josh Frydenberg, they were the wrong policy at the wrong time then, and worse now. \"They will be inflationary, they'll suck revenue out of a tax system at a time when we need more revenue to set up … a country for the future to drive our transition to a new clean energy economy and to find the revenue that we need for aged care, child care, disability care and medical care. \"This at a time when debt costs cost us more to service our debt than we have for a long, long time.\" Her suggestion? To retain the 37% tax rate on each dollar earned between $120,001-200,000, which is being abolished as part of stage three. I went down to Canberra to cover last year's event, and that was one of the key suggestions put forward by some of the tax experts I spoke to then.",
