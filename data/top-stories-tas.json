They have agreed to leave at Qantas' interim result in February, while Mr Goyder will step down ahead of the 2024 annual general meeting — but in Goyder's case some say that is not soon enough. You can learn more about that here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmopL2u9Nxw But it seems investors still want more board rejuvenation at Qantas. On Wednesday Ms Brenner faced a 17 per cent protest vote against her re-election at Telstra, after proxy firm Institutional Shareholder Services recommended against her because of her concurrent board role at the airline. But what for Todd Sampson? The Qantas board's in-house marketing and public relations expert may be the next target of big investors. Proxy adviser Ownership Matter has recommended Mr Sampson be forced to exit the company at the national carrier's upcoming annual general meeting. While another adviser to institutional investors, ISS, \"notes\" ongoing concerns about accountability, as well as Mr Sampson's role on the remuneration committee. It will be interesting to see how investors react when the airline holds its annual general meeting at the Melbourne Convention and Exhibition Centre on November 3.",
