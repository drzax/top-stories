Essentially, that's money or assets that Medibank needs to set aside, which can't be used for other purposes. The financial regulator said this measure will take effect from July 1, and will remain in place \"until an agreed remediation program of work is completed by Medibank to APRA's satisfaction\". APRA also said it will conduct a \"targeted technology review\" of the health insurer, focusing on its governance and risk culture. “In taking this action, APRA seeks to ensure that Medibank expedites its remediation program,” said APRA member Suzanne Smith. \"APRA expects Medibank to ensure there is appropriate accountability and consequence management, including impacts to executive remuneration where appropriate. Ms Smith added that her organisation continues to see \"poor cyber security practices and inadequate oversight from boards and management\".",
