Alumina invests in bauxite mining and alumina refining through Alcoa World Alumina and Chemicals, its joint venture with Alcoa Corporation. Alumina's chief executive Mike Ferraro says it has been a difficult first half and the company continues to face significant uncertainty due to ongoing delays with mining permits in Western Australia. \"Alcoa is continuing to work with a range of WA government agencies on the approvals for it to operate our WA mines, which in turn supply bauxite to our WA alumina refineries.\" \"We are operating in a complex regulatory environment where there is no certainty as to time frames or outcomes and the potential impacts on the business are unclear.\" The WA government is concerned about the impact of Alcoa's bauxite mining on drinking water supplies. Mr Ferraro says the alumina price had a strong start to the year before declining because of weak demand for aluminium outside China. \"Prices have risen again in the last 3 weeks, reflecting the tight global balance for alumina and a recovery in aluminium production in China.\" Investors get no dividend payout",
