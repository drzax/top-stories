After an inquiry lasting four-and-a-half-years, the royal commission has made 222 recommendations for change. Commissioners said: \"Inclusion involves social transformation that enables people with disability to live, learn, work, play, create and engage alongside people without disability”. Disability advocates have been eagerly awaiting the findings and are hoping for reform across areas like education, employment, and housing. The royal commission began in 2019 and held 32 public hearings, which scrutinised the experiences of the 4.4 million Australians who live with disability. Social Services Minister Amanda Rishworth and NDIS Minister Bill Shorten will hold a media conference later today. You can continue reading this story by the Specialist Reporting Team's Evan Young and Celina Edmonds, with national disability affairs reporter Nas Campanella at the link below.",
