I've spoken to ASIO director-general Mike Burgess on the sidelines of a Five Eyes summit in California, where he's again stated there's no reason to raise the national terror threat level from 'possible'. But he added it was under constant review. \"There's no doubt the duration and nature of this war or conflict actually can drive changes in our security environment,\" he said. \"So yes, it is a factor. It's not the only factor. We will continue to watch that.\" Mr Burgess reiterated that ASIO was anticipating \"spontaneous violence\" arising from Australian protests being held in response to the Israel-Gaza war, and urged all members of the community to avoid using \"inflamed language\". \"What ASIO worries about is not protest and counter-protest,\" he said. \"We look for those small number of individuals that have an ideology that thinks violence is the answer, or any individual that actually goes to violence in the promotion of their political cause or promoting communal violence. \"And when they do, that's an act of terrorism and we and the police will act swiftly.\"",

Human rights organisations, including Amnesty International, are also urging the international community to do more to ensure civilians are not targeted in the ongoing Israel-Gaza conflict. Speaking to Nour Haydar on AM, Amnesty International Australia campaigner Nikita White said the organisation has collected what they say is evidence of human rights abuses taking place in the days since the latest conflict began. \"We know there is always reluctance from the government to name war crimes at times. But there is evidence mounting of war crimes â€¦ and we want the Australian Government to understand that when organisations like Amnesty call something a war crime, there is a lot of thought that's gone into this,\" she said. The Australian Palestine Advocacy Network is another signatory to the statement with group president Nasser Mashni saying it was time for politicians in Canberra to stand up and demand an end to the bombardment which was affecting more than 2 million people. But CEO of the Executive Council of Australian Jewry has criticised human rights groups, saying they needed to be stronger in the criticism of Hamas and now was not the time to end military action.

You see it in the hours worked, participation has come off a bit, but still near record highs, and we also know that job ads have been a bit weaker as well. \"So we're seeing some of that softening as a consequence of the combined economic challenges from around the world, and here at home. \"We know that the interest rate rises, which are already in the system, are biting consumption hard in particular. \"We know that retail turnover has been soft, and we know that people are under pressure.\"",

Brody Viney, a senior economist at NAB, says it is their expectation that there will be one more rate hike before the end of the year. \"Most likely at the November meeting, after that [quarterly] inflation figure we get next week,\" he told News Channel. He said NAB is expecting a \"strong print\" in the inflation data for the trim mean and headline rates, and that would put pressure on the RBA to raise rates at its November meeting. \"For the RBA, they are still looking at a very high inflation rate and a very tight labour market as we've seen today,\" he said. \"For them, it's really a matter of can they be confident they've done enough to bring inflation back down to target in the way they're currently expecting? \"We think [next week's inflation figures] will likely challenge their forecast around the rate of improvement in inflation. \"We know they've stated in the recent minutes from the October meeting that they have a very low tolerance for inflation not coming down as fast as they're expecting. \"If we do get that upside surprise on inflation next week that we're expecting, we think that should be enough to push them to do one more rate rise .\"",
