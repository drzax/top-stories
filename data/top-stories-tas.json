              "plaintext": "France, China and the UAE's ambassadors to the United Nations have amplified demands for a ceasefire in Gaza after an emergency Security Council meeting. French Ambassador Nicolas de Riviere said \"the humanitarian effort which is taking place now is insufficient\". \"They are still fighting. It should stop. We need a truce, a sustainable and durable truce,\" he said. \"It should lead to a ceasefire. But we need a truce first to provide humanitarian access.\" United Arab Emirates Ambassador Lana Nusseibeh echoed the calls for a ceasefire, saying \"there are a number of innocent lives under the rubble today\". \"Without a cessation of hostilities or some kind of humanitarian truce that is immediately implemented, far too many civilians have already lost their lives and far too many more will continue to lose their lives unless that is put into place,\" she said. China's Ambassador Zhang Jun said \"no one is safe\" as aid workers and journalists are killed. \"Palestinian civilians are also deprived of necessities essential to their survival. In the midst of this catastrophic situation, we emphasize the need for the Security Council to act with urgency and adopt a meaningful and actionable resolution,\" he said. \"We call for an urgent humanitarian ceasefire. â¦ This is desperately needed to enable full, rapid, safe and unhindered humanitarian access.\" Paris will host an international humanitarian conference for the civilian population in Gaza later this week as it looks to coordinate international efforts for the Israeli-occupied Palestinian enclave. Diplomats said the conference in Paris on Thursday would also look at setting up a maritime corridor to use sea lanes to ship humanitarian aid into Gaza, but also to see how ships could be used to help the wounded evacuated from Gaza. The United States is pushing hard to arrange pauses in the conflict to allow in aid rather than a full ceasefire, arguing, like Israel, that Hamas militants would just take advantage. \"We're trying to get more trucks through,\" said Robert Wood, deputy US ambassador to the UN. \"This is a difficult situation and we're trying to do the best we can with the situation on the ground, so it's going to take some time. \"We're trying to [prevent] this war from spreading, dealing with the humanitarian situation on the ground â¦ and trying to get the hostages out.\" Reporting with Reuters",
