Energy and materials were the best performing sectors, driven by strong gains across AGL Energy (+2.9%), Pilbara Minerals (+2.5%) and Capricorn Metals (+2.4%). Lake Resources was the worst performing stock on the ASX 200 (for the second day in a row). Its share price slumped by 19.7% today (on top of yesterday's 20% plunge) after the lithium developer flagged a multi-year delay in the first production from its Kachi lithium project (in Argentina), and more than doubled the cost estimate. Shares of Premier Investments (-4.1%), Domino's Pizza (-2.8%) and Core Lithium (-1.5%) also fell sharply. The Australian dollar, meanwhile, fell 0.7% to 68 US cents, giving up a chunk of last week's hefty gains. The local currency swerved lower as markets are increasingly betting the Reserve Bank will lift interest rates again in July. It was also dragged down by a fall in the Chinese yuan, as markets grew frustrated by a lack of significant new stimulus from Beijing (apart from cutting its one-year and five-year loan prime rates (LPR) by just 10 basis points) The Aussie dollar is often used as a liquid proxy for the yuan given China is the single biggest importer of Australian commodities.",
