              "plaintext": "Good morning, it's Thursday, June 15 and you're reading the ABC's markets and business blog. Let's start with the big news overnight, which was the US Federal Reserve deciding to keep interest rates on hold at 5% to 5.25%. The Fed elected to hit pause on the current rate hike cycle, which has so far seen 10 consecutive rate rises. But even though the US won't see rates rising this month, Fed chairman Jerome Powell said there may be more rate rises on the way. \"Looking ahead, nearly all committee participants view it as likely that some further rate increases will be appropriate this year to bring inflation down to 2% over time,\" Powell said at a press conference. The reason? Persistent inflation in the US economy that's taking time to come down. \"Inflation has moderated somewhat since the middle of last year, nonetheless, inflation pressures continue to run high and the process of getting inflation down to 2% has a long way to go,\" he said. Naturally, a statement like that sent Wall Street trade down, but things steadied towards the close of trade, with a mixed result. Back home and all eyes are eagerly watching for the latest unemployment figures, which will be out at 11:30am AEST. As for what analysts are predicting, the Commonwealth Bank is expecting the unemployment rate will remain steady at 3.7%, with around 20,000 new jobs added. Data on consumer inflation expectations and population growth are also being released today, while the ASX is set to open higher after some positive gains in the futures overnight. All in all, there's a bit on! Stick with us and let's get into it.",
