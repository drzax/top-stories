Some of the 240 hostages that Israel says were seized by Hamas are believed to be held in the vast tunnel complex, compounding the difficulty of fighting in an urban setting. \"Over the last day, combined IDF struck approximately 300 targets, including anti-tank missile and rocket launch posts below shafts, as well as military compounds inside underground tunnels belonging to the Hamas terrorist organisation,\" an Israeli military statement said. Militants responded with anti-tank missiles and machine gun fire, the IDF said, claiming an unspecified number of militants were killed. Hamas said in a statement its fighters were engaging in fierce battles with Israeli ground forces, who were taking losses. \"The occupation is pushing its soldiers into proud Gaza, which will always be the cemetery of invaders,\" Hamas said.
