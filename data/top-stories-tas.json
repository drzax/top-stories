The Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) has released its latest 10-year outlook, and is warning that the outlook for the national grid has worsened since February. AEMO says these reliability problems means \"imminent and urgent investment\" is needed, or \"the reliability of the National Electricity Market (NEM) will be at risk. But it's not just South Australia and Victoria who are facing issues — the NEM includes all states and territories, except for Western Australia and the Northern Territory. So what's behind the reliability problems? A lack of investment in renewable energy generation, storage and transmission as coal-fired power stations shut down. AEMO's chief executive Daniel Westerman says the forecast hotter and dryer summer ahead is a significant risk to the grid. \"Breaching the reliability standard doesn't necessarily mean that there will be blackouts ,\" he told AM. \"What it means is that there's not enough electricity supply to meet the standard and that more investment is needed, and that's what we're calling for. \"However, we are also saying that this summer, we'll see an elevated risk compared with recent years, and that is primarily because this summer is forecast to be hotter and drier than the last summers. \"But it's also because the reliability of our old coal fired generators is at historic lows and plant operators are telling us that that's unlikely to materially improve. \"Now, as you'd expect, for this summer, like every summer, AEMO, together with industry and governments are well underway with our preparation to manage these conditions, but we're flagging reliability risks to remain. \" You can read more about this story from political reporter Tom Lowrey below:",

Overnight, the tech darling was Wall Street's most traded company, with a whopping $US35.5 billion worth of shares exchanged during the session, gaining 1% at the close. The gain came as a regulatory filing from the company noted the US had expanded the restriction of Nvidia's sophisticated artificial intelligence chips to China and other regions, including some countries in the Middle East. Nvidia hasn't said which countries in the Middle East were affected by this, and hasn't provided a breakout of how much of its revenue comes from the region. In the three months to July 30, Nvidia received most of its $US13.5 billion in sales from the US, China and Taiwan, with 13.9% of its sales from all other countries combined. Nvidia hasn't responded to a request for comment from Reuters, and neither has the US Commerce department, which administers new licensing requirements on exports. \"During the second quarter of fiscal year 2024, the USG (US government) informed us of an additional licensing requirement for a subset of A100 and H100 products destined to certain customers and other regions, including some countries in the Middle East,\" Nvidia said in the filing. One year ago, Nvidia said US officials told it to stop exporting the same two computing chips for AI work to China. — Additional reporting by Reuters",

Let's start as we always do by looking at Wall Street from overnight, where it was a positive day of trade. The S & P 500 gained 0.4%, the Dow Jones was up 0.1%, and the Nasdaq was 0.5% higher — extending the rally on Wall Street for a fourth day. So what was behind that increase? Weaker than expected data, interestingly enough. Two key pieces of data came out overnight: The ADP employment change was lower than expected, only adding 177,000 jobs; and GDP growth for the second quarter was revised down to 2.1% from 2.4%. Those two figures combined have further solidified expectations that the US Federal Reserve will pause interest rate hikes next month and, as a result, the US economy looks likely to stick to its much discussed \"soft landing\" scenario (for a local reference, think of the RBA and its \"narrow path\"). Across the Atlantic in Europe, there was a bit of a mixed result in the markets. The Stoxx600 was lower, the UK market was stronger, while France and Germany were lower. The slight dip in Germany's markets came from weak data, showing a 13.2% drop in imports in the year to July — the sharpest drop since 1981. As for what we can expect locally today? All signs point to a slightly more positive start for the ASX, with futures up slightly to 0.1% as of 7:50am AEST. Plus we've also got some data dropping that will no doubt reverberate across the market — we have housing credit data and private capex (short for capital expenditure) numbers dropping later on in the morning. Feeling up to speed? That's the spirit — grab a coffee, savour this final winter's morning, and stick around to see where the day takes us.",
