It was not known what damage it caused. The rocket and the fact that Hamas appears to be targeting the airport could explain the Australian Government’s decision to cancel further repatriation flights. Yesterday, a Qantas flight with 238 people left Ben Gurion for Heathrow. It was free for Australian citizens who wanted to leave due to the war between Israel and Gaza. But unexpectedly today the government announced that other repatriation flights would be cancelled. The reason for the sudden cancellation could be that Australian intelligence has received information that Hamas will escalate its attacks on the airport in the event of an Israeli ground invasion. Scores of flights have been cancelled as airlines decide not to take the risk of an attack.",
