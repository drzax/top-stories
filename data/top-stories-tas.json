Profit attributable to Telstra equity holders was up 14.2% to $1.93 billion. The rise in profit was based on a 5.4% increase in total income to $23.2 billion. \"We remain disciplined on reducing our costs, particularly considering the external economic environment,\" said Telstra's CEIO Vicki Brady. Ms Brady said her priority was to continue to improve customer experience and further reduce complaints to the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman, which the company said fell by more than a third on the previous year. Telstra also revealed that its current plan is to retain ownership of its infrastructure business, InfraCo Fixed, \"for at least the medium term\" after it was structurally separated out from the rest of the firm earlier this year, meaning a sale or public share float is off the table for now. The telco was cautious in its guidance, predicting total income should be slightly higher than current levels but could be lower ($22.8 to $24.8 billion), while underlying profits before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) of $8.2-8.4 billion would be slightly higher than this year's $8 billion result. \"While our cost reduction ambition is being challenged by high inflation, we still expect to achieve the large majority of this by financial year 2025,\" added Ms Brady. The company will pay a fully-franked final dividend of 8.5 cents per share bringing total dividends for the year to 17 cents, slightly up on last year.",

West Texas crude also fell to $US75.35, and is the lowest level for both benchmarks in almost two weeks. It comes after the US's inventories of crude oil fell by close to 6 million barrels last week, thanks to strong exports and increased run rates by refiners. But despite an increase in crude production, those inventories are still falling, and is a sign that refiners are struggling to keep up with demand.",

The most recent ABS data showed that 33,000 people gained work in June, with hours worked also increasing — showing more Australians were working full-time. So what can we expect from today's data? Analysts from NAB and Commonwealth Bank are expecting a slight uptick in the unemployment rate, and expect it to return to 3.6%. CBA forecasts around 20,000 new jobs being created, while NAB expects employment growth to come in around 15,000. It's no secret that the RBA wants to see unemployment go higher, and noted that there were \"some signs that the labour market was at a turning point\". The RBA expects an unemployment rate of 3.9% by the fourth quarter, so a gradual lift between now and then is on the cards. All that said though, unemployment can be volatile, and it has defied just about everyone's expectations in the past — we'll find out whether that labour market resilience will continue a little later this morning.",
