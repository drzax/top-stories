Qantas also notes that demand for travel right now remains strong, and expects to carry more than 4 million passengers during the September/October school holidays and football finals, with 35,000 domestic and international services. Compared to this time last year, Qantas had 3.7 million passengers on around 28,000 services over those four weeks.",

The airline says the combination of higher oil prices, higher refiner margins and a weaker Australian dollar are responsible for the substantial rise in its fuel costs. Qantas says it intends to absorb the higher costs for now, but will monitor fuel prices in the coming weeks. \"If current levels are sustained, [Qantas] will look to adjust its settings ,\" the airline said in a statement to the ASX. \"Any changes would look to balance the recovery of higher costs with the importance of affordable travel in an environment where fares are already elevated .\"",

The 12-time Grammy Award winner accepted Travis Kelce 's invitation to see the Kansas City Chiefs play the Chicago Bears at Arrowhead Stadium. Rumours have been flying recently that the global pop superstar and footballer have been seeing each other. It all began when Kelce said on his New Heights podcast that he was disappointed that he didn't have the chance to meet Swift and gift her a friendship bracelet during her stop in Kansas City on her Eras Tour. Then, during an appearance on The Pat McAfee Show, Kelce said: \"I threw the ball in her court and told her, 'I've seen you rock the stage in Arrowhead. You might have to come see me rock the stage in Arrowhead and see which one's a little more lit.'\" Swift is currently on a break from her sold-out Eras world tour, which resumes in November.",
