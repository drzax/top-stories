Leader of the upper house, Jaclyn Symes, says she won't be encouraging them to appear at the public hearings. \"This is an upper house inquiry. The Liberal Party knew that this was the rules of engagement when you have an upper house inquiry. \"If they wanted to hear from lower house members they could've come to us and considered another forum.\"",

As AAP reports, an accompanying strategy report will outline where the government should focus its efforts, tackling emerging issues such as disinformation and economic security, supporting Pacific resilience and strengthening ties in the Indo-Pacific. New Zealand's government has already invested in replacing its Vietnam-era P-3 Orion surveillance planes with P-8 Poseidon aircraft, upgrading its C-130 Hercules cargo planes, and boosting salaries to improve retention. But its defence forces are still stretched thin. The review comes as concerns grow around national security, threats with geostrategic competition heating up and climate change causing more frequent and worse weather events. New Zealand's Defence Minister, Andrew Little, this year said that the country, which spends about 1 per cent of its GDP on defence, would need to make big investments as it faces these challenges.",

We had initial monthly retail figures on Friday last week, showing a 0.8% fall in June. But that was a 0.8% fall in the value of goods and services sold, and we all know that prices have generally been going up quite a bit, so the quantity of goods and services sold likely fell even further. Well, today the ABS has released data on the volume of retail sales for the June quarter — a key component of economic growth, as measured by Gross Domestic Product. The news is bleak. Retails sales volumes fell 0.5% in the June quarter, backing up a 0.8% plunge in the March quarter and a 0.4% fall in the three months to December 31 last year. All up, the bureau's head of retail statistics Ben Dorber says the annual number is the worst in more than three decades, if you exclude the pandemic lockdowns. \"It's the first time since 2008 that retail sales volumes have recorded three consecutive quarterly falls,\" he noted in the report. \"Retail sales volumes are down 1.4 per cent compared to the June quarter last year. \"Outside of the pandemic period, this is the first time since 1991 that sales volumes have fallen compared to the previous year.\" What was happening in Australia in the early 90s? A very, very nasty recession mainly caused by surging interest rates. Sounds like a pretty good reason for the Reserve Bank to take a break on the rate hikes for now.",
