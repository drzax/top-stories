Two yellow cards for Jamaica already, you feel like something's gotta give in the second half. Here's Kate O'Halloran at the ground: The atmosphere is supercharged in Naarm/Melbourne for the knockout clash between Colombia and Jamaica, with neither side having scored at half time. The crowd is arguably the loudest of any of the World Cup fixtures hosted by this city, and that includes the match between the Matildas and Canada. Colombian fans have come out in force, or at least in voice. Aside from the odd chant of “Bunny” (for star striker ‘Bunny’ Shaw) from Jamaican fans, it’s all about ‘las Chicas Superpoderosas’ (The Powerpuff Girls) this Tuesday night. Colombia look the better side on the pitch, too. The Reggae Girlz, who are yet to concede a goal at the tournament to date, are hanging on admirably, but Colombia are setting up plenty of likely chances. The biggest roars have been reserved for their 18-year-old prodigy Linda Caicedo, one of the best emerging football talents in the world. She scored arguably the goal of the tournament against Germany in the group stages, and looks dangerous every time she goes near it. In fact, she’s causing so many headaches for the Jamaican defence that Drew Spence decided to tackle her to the ground, Aussie Rules style, earning her a yellow card just before half-time.",
