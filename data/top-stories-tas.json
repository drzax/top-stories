About 2.1 million Australians have applied for a postal vote, many of those are now on their way.\" Rogers said the AEC's mobile teams had collected about 100,000 votes, including in remote communities, and that 20,000 votes had been cast overseas, including 7,000 at the High Commission in London.",
