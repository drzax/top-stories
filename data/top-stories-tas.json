He said the message from Washington was that although the US did not currently have evidence that the attack by Hamas on Israel was directed by any other foreign agent or was in concert with them, \"they are concerned that part of the motivation might have been to try to thwart the attempts, as they put it, to normalise relations between Israel and particularly with some of its Arab neighbours\". Here US Secretary of State Antony Blinken speaks on the issue: \"It's no surprise that those opposed to the efforts to normalise relations between Saudi Arabia and Israel, and more broadly, to normalise Israel's relations with countries throughout the region and beyond, who opposes it? Hezbollah, Hamas and Iran. \"So to the extent that this was designed to try and derail the efforts that were being made, that speaks volumes. \"But right now, the focus is on dealing with this attack, dealing with Hamas and we'll come to the normalisation efforts — which, by the way, are very difficult when it comes to Saudi Arabia and Israel.\" Watch the full update from the US here:",
