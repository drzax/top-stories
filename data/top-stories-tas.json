The All Ordinaries and the ASX 200 remain more than 1 per cent higher, with some strong gains from the major miners, including BHP (+1.6%), as well as a good session for the banks, led by NAB (+1.6%). Real estate is the best performing sector, with Charter Hall Social Infrastructure REIT (+3.5%), HMC Capital (+3.4%) and Charter Hall Group (+3.3%) among the top movers. 162 of the top 200 stocks are in positive territory. The optimism on the local market and around the region has been fueled by the in-principle agreement reached to raise the US debt ceiling. But UBS chief US economist Jonathan Pingle says \"it's not over, until it's over.\" Mr Pingle says the fact that 'X-date', or the date when the government will run out of measures to meet its debts and could potentially default, has been moved to June 5, from June 1, has substantially reduced the odds of the worst case scenario being realised. \"The later X-date and agreement  being reached significantly lower the odds of negative market and economic impact.\"",

In a statement and an open letter from acting chief executive Kristin Stubbins, the consulting firm said the assumption that all those who's names had been redacted were involved in wrongdoing was \"incorrect\". Here are the full comments from Ms Stubbins: \"I fully understand and acknowledge the calls for PwC to release the names of the individuals in the emails released by the Senate on 2 May 2023. \"There has been an assumption by some that all those whose names have been redacted must necessarily be involved in wrongdoing. That is incorrect. \"Based on our ongoing investigation, w e believe that the vast majority of the recipients of these emails are neither responsible for, nor were knowingly involved in any confidentiality breach. \"We have and will continue to take appropriate action against anyone who is found to have breached confidentiality or failed in their leadership duties.\" PwC did not release the redacted names.",
