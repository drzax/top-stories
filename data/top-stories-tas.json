We got children, dismembered, torn-apart flesh,\" said Saeed al-Nejma, 53, adding that he had been asleep with his family when the blast hit his neighbourhood. The camp had been struck overnight, killing at least 45, health officials said. Hamas said in a statement posted on Telegram that Israel had \"directly\" bombed citizens' homes, adding that most of the dead were women and children. Israel Defense Forces said it was gathering details about this incident. Hospital workers said Israeli jets also struck a house near a school at the crowded Bureij refugee camp, killing at least 13 people. The Bureij refugee camp is home to an estimated 46,000 people.",

The passengers are the biggest group of repatriated Australians from Gaza to land back in the country on a single commercial flight. Over the weekend a family of four also landed in Adelaide and another family of three touched down in Melbourne. ABC News was at the airport last night, where some said they were extremely happy and relieved to be home. Others spoke about the horror and trauma their family and friends are still facing in Gaza. The Department of Foreign Affairs says that they have now helped about 25 Australians and their family members leave Gaza, and they're still trying to help evacuate a further 67 Australian citizens and their family members.",
