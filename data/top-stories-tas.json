Los Angeles Superior Court Judge David Herrifor handed down the sentence to the 31-year-old who was convicted on three felonies in December. Herriford said it was “difficult to reconcile” the kind, charitable person and good father many people described Lanez as being during the sentencing hearing with the person who fired the gun at Megan. “Sometimes good people do bad things,” he said. “Actions have consequences, and there are no winners in this case.” Megan Thee Stallion said Lanez fired the gun at the back of her feet and shouted for her to dance as she walked away from an SUV in which they had been riding in July 2020, after leaving a pool party at Kylie Jenner’s Hollywood Hills home. She had to have surgery to remove bullet fragments. “Since I was viciously shot by the defendant, I have not experienced a single day of peace,” Megan said in a statement read by a prosecutor on Monday. “Slowly but surely, I’m healing and coming back, but I will never be the same.” Lanez asked the judge for mercy before his sentencing. “If I could turn back the series of events that night and change them I would,\" he said. “The victim was my friend, the victim is someone I still care for to this day. “Everything I did wrong that night, I take full responsibility for.”",

Perry was diagnosed with cancer in 2016, and his wife confirmed his death in a statement. \"Casper was a fun-loving, giving person,\" she says. \"He was a genuine, family oriented man. He loved Chicago with all his heart. He will be greatly missed.\" His Cha-Cha Slide continues to be a favorite at weddings, clubs and many other events about two decades after it became popular. Participants typically dance in lines and rows, following commands to a funky beat on when and where to step, stomp, hop and slide. In a May interview, he said that the Cha-Cha Slide initially was an aerobic exercise for his nephew who worked at a fitness club. It would go on to become popular in many countries. \"From there, it just took off,\" he said. \"I have one of the biggest songs that's played at all stadiums: hockey, basketball, football, baseball, they played it at the Olympics. \"It was something that everybody could do.\"",

This was after Moody's cut the credit ratings of several small to mid-sized US banks on Monday and said it might downgrade some of America's biggest lenders, warning that the sector's credit strength would likely be tested by funding risks and weaker profitability. Moody's slashed the ratings of 10 banks by one notch and placed six banking giants, including Bank of New York Mellon, US Bancorp, State Street and Truist Financial on review for potential downgrades. \"Many banks' second-quarter results showed growing profitability pressures that will reduce their ability to generate internal capital,\" Moody's said in a note. \"This comes as a mild US recession is on the horizon for early 2024 and asset quality looks set to decline, with particular risks in some banks’ commercial real estate (CRE) portfolios.\" Moody's said elevated CRE exposures are a key risk due to high interest rates, declines in office demand as a result of remote work, and a reduction in the availability of CRE credit. The agency also changed its outlook to negative for eleven major lenders, including Capital One, Citizens Financial and Fifth Third Bancorp. The collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank earlier this year sparked a crisis of confidence in the US banking sector, leading to a run on deposits at a host of regional banks despite authorities launching emergency measures to shore up confidence. Still, Moody's cautioned that banks with sizable unrealized losses that are not reflected in their regulatory capital ratios are vulnerable to a loss of confidence in the current high-rate environment. The sweeping report comes against the backdrop of tightening monetary conditions after the fastest pace of interest rate increases by the US Federal Reserve in decades slows demand and borrowing. The higher rates have also raised the spectre of recession and put pressure on sectors such as real estate to adjust to post-pandemic realities. - Reuters",

              "plaintext": "Italy dealt a surprise blow to its banks and sent shockwaves across the sector in Europe by setting a one-off 40% tax on profits reaped from higher interest rates, after reprimanding lenders for failing to reward deposits. Sharply higher official interest rates have yielded record profits for banks, as the cost of loans soared while lenders held off paying more on deposits. Countries such as Spain and Hungary have already imposed windfall taxes on the sector and others may now follow suit. Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni's government had floated the idea earlier in the year, but appeared to have cooled on the plan. Since then, however, bumper first-half results from banks brought the issue back into focus and prompted the government to act on the eve of the summer political shutdown. Lenders in Italy have passed on to depositors on average 12% of the rise in rates, versus 22% in the euro area, financial firm Jefferies calculated. \"One has only to look at banks' first-half profits ... to realise that we are not talking about a few millions, but ... of billions,\" Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini told a news conference in Rome late on Monday. \"If (it is true that) the burden deriving from the cost of money has ... doubled for households and businesses, what current account holders receive has certainly not doubled.\" Italy's banking share index had plunged 7.3% on Tuesday (local time), with sector leader Intesa Sanpaolo down 8.6% and rival UniCredit down 5.8%. Italian banks are up 50% over the past year, outperforming a 20% European sector rise. The Italian government wants to use the proceeds to help those struggling with the cost of living, such as mortgage holders. - Reuters",
