Even, nay especially, with Jarome Luai sidelined and Isaah Yeo off for 15 minutes with an HIA, Nathan Cleary grabbed this team and said \"come with me\". And boy did they. He finishes with a try (the match-winner), two try assists, 162 run metres, four goals, four tackle breaks, two line breaks and 660 kicking metres. The finish to that game might be the greatest 25-minute stretch of individual rugby league football I've ever witnessed. \"Hardest game I've ever played,\" Cleary says on the podium, praising the Broncos and Ezra Mam in particular, as \"a freak\". \"They're easily the most dangerous team in the NRL,\" he tells ABC Sport. \"Ezra and Reece made me look stupid a couple of times.\"",
