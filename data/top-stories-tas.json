The ABC has seen an email sent by Australian consular officials which says the border may open to some Australians at 9am local time (6pm AEDT) on Wednesday. The email urges recipients to \"seize this opportunity to depart Gaza\" if they \"deem it safe to do so\". Recipients have also been told to take enough food and water to last for at least five hours and expect large crowds. There are 88 Australian citizens, residents, and their families known to be in Gaza. International media have reported that Egypt is set to allow 400 foreign nationals to leave Gaza through its border after a deal was struck with the United States and Israel.",

There are now an average of eight incidents per day, compared to three before the October 7 Hamas attack. ABC Middle East correspondent Allyson Horn reports from the village of Qusra in the West Bank, where some of the worst attacks happened. She spoke with Abedalazheim Al Wadi, who said his brother and nephew were gunned down by Israeli settlers, who live in the West Bank illegally according to international law. \"My brother has 11 children, his son was about to become a lawyer in a couple of weeks. He had a fiancée and was about to get married, and they kill him,\" he said. \"We live in fear and it's normal for us. Anger and depression is our daily life.\" Yael Ze'evi, who lives in an illegal Israeli outpost bordering Qusra, denies settlers in her community attack their neighbours or kill Palestinians. \"From my point of view, our lives come first. I walk around with a weapon, I have a handgun. If someone comes to me and threatens me, I won't hesitate to shoot him,\" she said. \"We don't enter their areas, we don't enter their villages.\" Footage from two weeks ago shows Israeli settlers shooting guns in Qusra. Ahed Mahmoud Owdi says his six-year-old niece was shot in the back when they escaped from their house. Three other Palestinians were killed. \"We did not provoke them, we had nothing to defend ourselves. We are peaceful. We are not even safe to go to work, we cannot leave our house safely\", he said. \"There is no safety.\" Allyson will be doing a Q & A on the blog at 6:30pm AEDT.
