              "plaintext": "With the Reserve Bank's cash rate having surged from pandemic lows of 0.1% to 4.1% in little more than a year, and with another rate rise to 4.35% widely expected tomorrow, it's no surprise there was some focus on how borrowers were coping at Westpac's results briefing. CEO Peter King said the bank had only seen a modest rise in hardship and arrears, which were about half the level seen at the peak of the COVID pandemic. \"We are supporting customers who are doing it tough and ended the year with just over 13,000 customers in hardship arrangements,\" he told analysts and reporters. \"This is still lower than the peak we supported during COVID, which is a positive indicator that customers are mostly adapting to the environment.\" Westpac data show 40% of its mortgage customers are less than a month ahead in their repayments, while roughly 1.5% are already at least 30 days behind. When asked by me whether the bank had done any internal modelling on how many customers might fall behind if rates remain around current levels to the end of next year, Mr King instead addressed the 40% figure. \"The figure that you refer to there actually includes, say, interest-only loans, where a lot of people don't want to pay ahead because of tax benefits, fixed rates, as well as those that are new loans, which typically aren't ahead because they haven't had the opportunity to to get ahead yet. \"But I think the bigger point is the trend hasn't changed that much. So, that's why we say most customers are adapting to the environment.\" That said, there's an awful lot of Westpac customers yet to come off their very low pandemic-era fixed rates. Westpac was offering a 1.89% four-year fixed loan product as late as March 2021, and the bank's results appear to show it's only about halfway through its fixed mortgage expiries. Separately, Mr King also revealed that the mortgage market had become less competitive, as the big banks try to restore their profit margins, which had been under pressure in the first half of the financial year. \"Competition in home lending was fierce during the first half of the year with intensity easing in the second half,\" he commented. \" Actions were taken to restore the front book profitability by reducing discounts. \"We were also later than some peers to remove or reduce cash-backs.\"",
