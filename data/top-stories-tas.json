Fair to say Australia left a few runs on the table considering how many batters got scores without reaching three figures, but still, scoring more than 400 after being put in to bat by the opposition is a massive win. For England, it's a worrying sign from this bowling attack that looked pedestrian for large chunks in favourable conditions. Now it's up to the willow-wielders to take advantage of what look like better batting conditions, with openers Zak Crawley and Ben Duckett facing an awkward 15-minute window before lunch.",
