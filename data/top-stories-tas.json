The ABC projects that a majority of voters in South Australia have voted No to the proposed constitutional change, along with a majority of voters in New South Wales and Tasmania. It means the proposal has not secured support from enough states to pass. The request for a Voice was made by Indigenous Australians who took part in the Uluru Dialogues and issued the Statement from the Heart six years ago. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese committed his government to implementing the Uluru statement “in full” in his election victory speech in May last year. He argued it would deliver practical benefits, contribute to meeting Closing the Gap targets, and give long overdue recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples in the constitution. But Australian voters have today rejected that pathway.",

That will be split between $3 million through the International Committee of the Red Cross to fund \"urgent needs like restoring essential services and providing medical support to victims of the conflict\" and $7 million through United Nations agencies providing critical aid. The UN support will include emergency water supplies, nutrition, sanitation and hygiene services and child protection. The Gaza Strip has been cut off from food, water and fuel supplies coming through Israel, with electricity also cut and several health facilities damaged in air strikes. \"We have seen devastating loss of innocent life since the heinous attacks on Israel by brutal terrorist group Hamas,\" Foreign Minister Penny Wong said. \"Far from representing the Palestinian people, Hamas undermines Palestinian needs and aspirations. \"We continue to call for the unconditional release of all hostages. We stand with Israel and reiterate its right to defend itself. \"President Biden has called on Israel to operate by the rules of war in its response to Hamas attacks — we join him and others in that call. \"We call for safe and unimpeded humanitarian access to civilians affected by the worsening humanitarian crisis in Gaza. \"We call for the establishment of a corridor to enable humanitarian needs to be met. And we support the work of the United States, Egypt and others towards this goal. \"Adherence to international humanitarian law must be prioritised — including the protection of civilians, wherever they live.\"",

It's currently just before 9am in Gaza. The post on X, which includes a map, translated from Arabic into English reads: An important statement to the residents of Gaza City  In recent days, we have appealed to you to leave Gaza City to the south of Wadi Gaza in order to preserve your safety. I would like to inform you that the IDF will allow movement on the indicated streets without any harm between the hours of 10:00-16:00. For your safety, take advantage of the short time to move south — from Beit Hanoun to Khan Yunis. If you care about yourself and your loved ones, go south as instructed. Rest assured that Hamas leaders have taken care of themselves and are taking cover from strikes in the region. Residents of Al-Shati, Rimal, and west of Zeitoun will also be allowed to move on Daldul and Al-Seena Streets towards Salah Al-Deen and Al-Bahr Streets. Note: The translation of this tweet has been updated to correct several town names.",
