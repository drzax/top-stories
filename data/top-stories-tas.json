He says there are few things behind higher rental prices: The average number of people living in households declined as people wanted more space and worked from home, which affected demand There has been a big increase in population, with the population increasing by 2% this year. \"Are there 2% more houses? No,\" Lowe says. \"We've got a lot of people coming into the country, people wanting to live alone or move out of home. \"The way that this ends up fixing itself is unfortunately through higher housing prices and higher rents. \"We need more people on average to live in each dwelling, and higher prices do that.\" Senator Smith then paraphrases a hearing involving Treasury officials yesterday, who suggests that the end of high rent prices may be coming. Lowe admits he did not follow the Treasury's comments yesterday, but says that is not the expectation of the RBA, and expects a further increase in rent prices because markets are so tight and population growth is so strong. \"That is ominous,\" Senator Smith replies.",
