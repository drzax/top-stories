France, Italy and Spain have all announced evacuations from Niger for their citizens and other European nationals, concerned that they risked becoming trapped by the coup. The Associated Press says about 600 French nationals want to leave, along with 400 people of other nationalities from Belgians to Danish, according to officials. The first flight carried mostly French nationals, and officials hope to finish the evacuation flights by today. With Niger's air space closed, France coordinated the evacuations with the regime that ousted the nation's leader, but without withdrawing its support for democratically elected President Mohamed Bazoum, diplomatic officials say.

That compares to just over 13 million Australians who only hold one job, meaning that 6.6% of all workers are holding down multiple positions. Before COVID, the proportion of workers doing multiple jobs was fairly steady between 5-6%, but has remained above that level since December 2021. On average, multiple job holders worked longer hours than those with only one position. The average multiple job holder worked 30.9 hours a week in their main job and 9.6 hours in their secondary one, for a total of 40.5 hours — above a standard working week. Single job holders worked 35.5 hours per week on average. Men with multiple jobs worked the longest hours, on average, at 45.3, women with multiple jobs worked an average of 36.4 hours a week in paid employment. Women were more likely to hold multiple jobs (7.7%) than men (5.7%). Those aged 20-24 were most likely to hold more than one job (8.9%), while 7.9% of employed 15-19-year-olds also held more than one job. Only 5.5% of employed people aged 60-64 and 5.2% of those working aged 65 or older worked more than one job. Those working in agriculture, forestry and fishing, administrative and support services, arts and recreation, accommodation and food services, healthcare and social assistance, and education and training had the highest rates of multiple job holding (all above 7%). Those employed by utilities, financial and insurance firms, wholesalers, manufacturers and logistics firms were the least likely to hold multiple jobs (less than 5%).",

While the labour market is tight, the jobless rate rose from 3.4 per cent to 3.6 per cent seasonally adjusted with 109,000 people out of work according to Statistics New Zealand. It says the labour force participation rate of 72.4 per cent and the employment rate of 69.8 per cent are the highest on record. The tourism industry drove the increase with employment returning to pre-COVID levels. Wages increased by 4.3 per cent over the year to June. The Reserve Bank of New Zealand is expected to leave official interest rates unchanged at 5.5 per cent this month. The country's economy is in recession which was triggered by the central bank's aggressive rate rise campaign. While New Zealand's jobless rate is at a two-year high, Australia's unemployment rate of 3.5 per cent, is near a 50-year low. New Zealand closed its borders from early 2020 to mid-2022 because of COVID-19, which drove down the unemployment rate because temporary migration was restricted. Here's quick guide from CommSec on the unemployment rates in major economies: US: 3.6% UK: 4% Australia: 3.5% New Zealand: 3.6% Canada: 5.4% China: 5.2% Singapore: 1.9% Japan: 2.5% Netherlands: 3.5% Germany: 5.6% We are doing pretty good, even the unemployment rate rises to 4.5 per cent as the RBA predicts.",
