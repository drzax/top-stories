The Hamas-run Gaza health ministry says people are unable to leave, as the encirclement of the hospital by Israeli troops makes it too dangerous, Middle East correspondent Allyson Horn reports. Watch the full report below: \"Hamas says that Israeli tanks are at the gates of Al-Shifa and there has been heavy gun battles around the vicinity between Israeli troops and Hamas militants,\" she said. \"Because they say they cannot leave, the Hamas-run ministry of health says that now doctors are having to dig mass graves in the vicinity of the hospital to bury those people that have died over the last few days.\" About 600 patients and 5,000 civilians are stuck sheltering inside the hospital, according to the ministry. Israel claims that Hamas uses the hospital as a shield for military operations, which Hamas and the hospital leadership have denied. The World Health Organization has said that Al-Shifa has stopped functioning as a hospital and that the situation there is perilous.",

Tens of thousands of people have gathered to show support for Israel and oppose anti-Semitism in the United States. The March for Israel event has attracted busloads of demonstrators from all over the country. Many have held up signs showing photos of hostages to chants of \"let our people go\". Speakers have spoken against a rising wave of hate crimes targeting Jews in the US, which the FBI recently warned was reaching \"historic levels\". \"We are all being tested,\" actress Debra Messing told the crowd. \"A tsunami of hate has crashed down upon us, and then a defeaning silence. We see clearly now — we see naked, virulent Jew-hatred being disguised as a noble call for liberation, and we reject it.\" Congressional leaders from the Democrats and Republicans stood side-by-side on stage to reaffirm bipartisan support for the cause. \"We are here united,\" Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer told the crowd, \"Democrat and Republican, House and Senate, to say 'we stand with Israel'.\" Some speakers also voiced support for the Palestinian people and a desire to see an end to the horrors being endured by civilians in Gaza. Messing said she prayed for a \"free and flourishing Gaza\", to cheers from the crowd. Today's rally follows a huge pro-Palestinian demonstration in Washington a little over a week ago.",

              "plaintext": "US stock indexes rallied on Tuesday as cooler-than-expected inflation data boosted expectations that the Federal Reserve was done raising interest rates and could start cutting them next year. The benchmark S & P 500 briefly crossed the 4,500 mark for the first time in two months and the tech-heavy Nasdaq was trading at a fresh two-month high after data showed that growth in US consumer prices eased in October, in part due to lower gasoline prices. In the 12 months through October, the CPI climbed 3.2% after rising 3.7% in September, while economists polled by Reuters had forecast a 3.3% gain on a year-on-year basis. Core prices, which exclude the volatile food and energy components, rose 4.0% compared with economists' estimate of a 4.1% increase. \"We're happy to see both headline and core CPI come in lower than expected. It's telling us that the Fed is done, there's nothing left for it to do here,\" said Thomas Hayes, chairman at hedge fund Great Hill Capital at New York. \"This is what the Fed was looking for, slowing inflation, slowing labor market, and the economy's holding up at the same time.\" Following the data, traders erased bets the Fed would raise borrowing costs any further and piled into bets on rate cuts starting by May. They are currently pricing in a 100% chance the Fed will hold rates next month, as per CME Group's Fedwatch tool. US Treasury yields dropped, with the two-year yield, which best reflects short-term interest rate expectations, sliding to two-week lows. That, in turn, lifted megacap growth stocks such as Nvidia, Alphabet, Amazon and Tesla up between 1.6% and 4.7%. The small-cap Russell 2000 index jumped 4.7% to hit an over six-week high. Rate-sensitive sectors such as real estate and utilities, which have been hammered this year, rose 5.5% and 3.4%, respectively. Wall Street's main indexes have seen a strong rebound in November on expectations that US interest rates were near their peak, even as Fed Chair Jerome Powell last week left the door open to further tightening. Focus is also on negotiations by US lawmakers over a funding bill as they face an end-of-week deadline to fund the federal government.",
