Hodder Watt says a lack of signage, translators and low foot traffic at some of the booths meant many community members weren't aware that voting was underway. \"It really was left up to community members and organisations on the day to make people aware,\" he said. \"There is a risk there that some people would have missed out.\"",

Rinehart's company Hancock Prospecting let the ASX know yesterday evening that it has recently increased its stake in Liontown to 14.67%, from 12.36%. It will give Hancock a greater say over Liontown's direction as it awaits a takeover offer from Ablemarle, the world's biggest lithium producer. And when you look back through the company filings, you'll find Ms Rinehart has been increasing her stake in Liontown quite quickly. Less than four weeks ago, the Hancock group owned 7.72% voting power, but that was increased to 10.69% two weeks later, then to 12.36%, and now to 14.67%. Liontown shares have risen 0.5% today to $2.97 per share, up around 120% this year. The graph below shows how its share price has performed over the last six months:",

The RBNZ said the monetary committee agreed that interest rates will need to remain at a restrictive level for the foreseeable future to ensure consumer price inflation returns to its 1% to 3% target range. \"With monetary conditions remaining restrictive, spending growth is expected to decline further,\" the bank said.
