And then another computer, which the IDF spokesman says, already provides a lot of incriminating evidence. \"Now that's very quick to find that computer and decide it's incriminating evidence. \"They have not found what the United States and Israel's been insisting for weeks is the reason that hospitals were legitimate targets. \"They have not found that network of tunnels that they said was being used as a command and control centre.\" Lyons says Israel could face \"some serious questions\" now, adding more video footage may be provided later.

Earlier this morning, Bitcoin rose by more than 5.3%, taking it close to a one-week high of $US37,978. So far this year, the cryptocurrency has risen by about 125%. Sure, it's a far cry from the fever pitch Bitcoin experienced towards the end of 2021, but the crypto sector in general has been riding the highs of a rally in recent weeks. The cause of that rally? Investors expecting the end is nigh for central banks and their rate-hiking cycles — which draws cash back into high-risk assets like crypto. Since that high earlier today though, it's been steadily dropping. Currently, it's down 0.7% to be hovering around the $US37,337 mark.",

Australia's jobless rate is still close to its lowest level in 50 years, but the RBA is predicting it will rise towards 4.2% by the end of next year. So with unemployment edging up to 3.7% in October, will this have any impact on the central bank's next rates meeting in December? The short answer: it's unlikely to be helpful, but they'll be waiting for other data. Here's how KPMG's chief economist, Brendan Rynne interpreted the stats: \"Today's data provides some signals that the labour market is returning back to its natural level, albeit slowly – and slower than the RBA has been predicting,\" he wrote. \"This data, reaffirming the continued tightness in the labour market, combined with yesterday's WPI data showing the highest quarterly growth since the index's first release, is unlikely to be helpful for the RBA to looking for reasons to pause further increases in the cash rate. \"The December cash rate decision will therefore be highly contingent on the degree of stickiness in the inflation rate, which we will see in the week before the next meeting.\"",
