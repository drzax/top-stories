When he heard there had been a serious incident near the border with Gaza on October 7, he immediately jumped in his truck. He didn’t know what he was driving into when he headed down to southern Israel. Within hours of arriving, his truck was full of dozens of dead people who had been murdered by Hamas terrorists. Since then, he’s spent nearly every day collecting and transporting hundreds of bodies for identification and burial. He recounts one horrific story: “I walked into the house and there was a birthday cake sitting [there] … and you look up to the [photo on the] fridge and think, 'Who had a birthday that day?'\" he said. “We walk into the bedroom … and we see a family of five members in a circle hugging each other. “You can’t believe what your eyes [have] seen, you cannot understand the situation. “One second there was a party and the next, death in the worst way you can think of.” Mr Greiniman said his team was still going through Kibbutzim near the border, searching for bodies and remains of people who had been killed.",
