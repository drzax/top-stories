Most sectors are in the red with energy stocks and banks weighing on the index. Petrol refiner and service station owner Viva Energy (-7 per cent) has slumped on a media report that major shareholder Vitol could trim its stake. Miners are doing the best thanks to higher copper and iron ore prices. Liontown Resources shares are down 0.3 per cent to $3.00 after Gina Rinehart's Hancock Prospecting raised its stake. Last week, Liontown accepted a $6.6 billion takeover bid from global lithium giant Albemarle. Best and worst performers: Telix Pharmaceuticals: +3.5% Megaport: +2.3% Ingenia Communities: +1.9% Viva Energy: -7.3% Syrah Resources: -5.7% Chalice Mining: -5.7%",
