The federal government have allocated $12 billion in the budget to rewire the nation to build an 82 per cent renewable grid by 2030. NSW will collect $4.7 billion of that funding to unlock transmission and Renewable Energy Zones in partnership with the NSW government. The state is also expected to be a beneficiary of the $2 billion allocated to the Hydrogen Headstart program, which the Albanese government says will ensure Australia becomes a renewable energy superpower. NSW has three hydrogen hubs in the Illawarra, Hunter and Wagga Wagga regions."

NT Treasurer Eva Lawler’s inaugural budget features a massive infrastructure spend planned for the impending financial year, with $2.1 billion pegged mainly for the jurisdiction’s roads and housing. While the construction and mining sectors have applauded this year’s allocations, there’s not been any huge departmental increases put on the table for health, education or the NT Police force. The NT opposition, police union and territory’s social services council have all criticised the 2023 NT budget's priorities, saying more focus should've been placed on the region's most vulnerable. Opposition Leader Lia Finocchiaro said police were all but ignored in the middle of a \"crime crisis\"."

I've passed it to political reporter Jake Evans who says: There's a big \"TBC\" over the whole higher education sector, because the government is currently in negotiations with unions, universities and others to develop a \"University Accord\". That deal would be very wide-ranging, looking not only at tertiary education funding and structure, but also at student loans and loan repayment. For now, there's no new incentive schemes or loan relief, besides a technical decision by the government to forgo $21 million worth of debt it would be owed over the next decade from loans issued in 2017 and 2018 under the VET FEE-HELP program, due to delays in the transfer of those loans to the Australian Taxation Office. It means students currently paying off loans face a 7 per cent increase on June 1 when they are indexed, which will add thousands more to many student debts."

I've put your question to political reporter Jake Evan s who says: There is no new money for long COVID management in this budget. However the federal government has committed $50 million for further research on long COVID to be paid through the Medical Research Future Fund. A parliamentary committee inquiry into long COVID and repeat infections was released just at the end of last month, which included recommendations for long COVID clinics to be established in some public hospitals, more support and education. The government is developing its national plan on long COVID which it says will consider the findings of that committee's inquiry, so we may see more on this in the future."

                  "headline": "Conservation groups say the budget doesn't do enough for the environment",
                  "articleBody": "By the Specialist Reporting Team's Loretta Florance: The government came into office with a mandate to improve Australia's environmental record, but conservation groups say while the budget has some promising measures on climate change, it doesn't provide nearly enough money to back the government's ambitious agenda to do more to protect the country's natural environment. The Australian Conservation Foundation's Kelly O'Shanassy welcomes investment in \"climate action, renewable energy and clean exports\", including $2 billion to speed up development of Australia's hydrogen industry and $1.3 billion towards energy efficiency in houses. \"That's really important because Australians are struggling with the cost of living and investing in energy efficiency in homes,\" she says. There was also $121 million over four years to make good on the government's promise to set up a new national body, Environment Protection Australia (EPA), as well as another $51.5 million over four years for a new environment information agency. Ms O'Shanassy says that's \"a good investment in forming a new agency\". But the public is yet to see legislation to establish a national EPA, and the Wilderness Society's Tim Beshara says the government needs to get on with it. \"The new EPA and a data collection agency is a good start for figuring out how we do address the problems that we're facing on the nature side,\" he says. \"[But] I think that's a patch-up for where we should have been. I think that should have been in last year's budget and we should have been well advanced from where we're at right now to the reform agenda.\" Both groups also say the government hasn't put any significant new money behind its ambitious goal of zero extinctions. \"There's nothing in this budget that is going to lead to additional species coming off the [endangered] list in the right way — that is not becoming extinct, but actually becoming more and more common, less and less rare,\" Beshara says. \"The Australian government has obligations for hundreds of species to have put in place a recovery plan and to fund that, and the backlog on writing those plans and implementing those plans and funding those plans is rising. \"So, until there is dedicated additional substantive funding put into endangered species recovery, things are going to continue to decline. It's hard not to see we're going to have more extinctions [under] the Albanese government.\""

However, the amount you receive will differ from state to state, as the money is jointly funded and the federal government has had to strike eight different deals with each state and territory. $500 will be offered in NSW, Victoria, Queensland, South Australia and Tasmania $350 in total relief will be available in Western Australia and the territories $650 will also be available to eligible small businesses in states that have matched the relief."

Andrews said there were positive signs in the budget for Victoria, declaring \"the decade of rip off is over.\" \"You can’t fix nine years of neglect in just one budget but there are good positive signs, but we’ll keep the pressure on, of course, because we want to get our fair share,\" he said. Mr Andrews said the health initiatives announced last night were \"a good first step\" in improving medical care across the country. \"National Cabinet agreed earlier this year that health is the number one issue and it was very pleasing to see significant investments – not everything – but a big next step in last night’s federal budget. \"Particularly, longer consultations, higher payments to GPs and higher rebates particularly for vulnerable people. This is all about a better primary care system.\" Andrews said he would discuss more moves to reform the health system at a health-only National Cabinet meeting before the end of the year. There was no money allocated last night towards the 2026 Commonwealth Games, which Victoria is hosting in regional centres, but the Premier said that doesn’t mean there won’t be a federal contribution. \"The Commonwealth Games is not happening next week so we do have time and we do have some optimism that the Albanese government will be a partner,\" he said."

My daughter did her bit is the government going to step up? - Richard. Hi Richard, thanks for writing in. I've put your question to political reporter Jake Evans who says: We still don't have details on the future of that policy or much at all of the tertiary sector, because the federal government is still reviewing the higher education sector, with a plan to introduce a \"University Accord\" by the end of the year. There were no new measures for universties this budget — but expect more to come in the future."

But here's national technology reporter, Danny Tran: Artificial intelligence is getting a boost, with the federal government tipping in $101.2 million over the next five years to help businesses integrate AI and quantum technologies. That includes expanding the National AI Centre and its role in making sure the technology is responsible (I, Robot, anyone?) as well as setting up the Australian Centre for Quantum Growth. Misha Schubert from Science and Technology Australia says this type of investment is important: \"Every time anyone enters a prompt or an instruction into ChatGPT or a generative AI tool, it is hoovering that up and building a complex profile about us. \"So [it is] really important that we diligently deepen our investments in ethical and responsible use of AI and the sort of safeguards around privacy and copyright and security on generative AI tools.\" Simon Bush from the Australian Information Industry Association, the peak body for the information and communications technology sector, says we have a \"very limited\" opportunity to get this technology right. \"We are competing with our trading partners, both friendly and not so friendly, in relation to areas like AI and Quantum,\" he says. \"This funding enables smaller Australian innovative companies to access government support, to commercialise their IP and their technology, to really bring that to the market and also [retain] really smart people, so [we] don't lose them overseas. \"It’s a really good down payment on securing Australia’s future.\""

Julie: We know that many aspects of the cost of living are at near-record highs, including rental prices, petrol, groceries and other essentials, which makes it even less sustainable for a Jobseeker recipient to live a dignified life. We saw during the pandemic that increased payments reduced measures of poverty and housing stress, but a very modest increase of $2.80 per day will sadly make little difference to many. Our political leaders must create a fair social safety net that ensures all Jobseeker recipients can afford an adequate standard of living."

The federal budget announced a 10 per cent increase in agricultural levies to fund biosecurity activities and organisations, expecting it to raise $153 million over three years. Littleproud told ABC NewsRadio this was an \"outrageous move\". \"They are going to tax farmers to pay for the biosecurity costs of their competitors to import product into this country, and that has to be passed on to the consumer,\" he said, adding it would not help address food price inflation. He also said regional Australians would have few benefits from Labor's cost-of-living package, stressing what was needed in regional Australia was infrastructure and new childcare places. He was also concerned that new Medicare boosts would lead to the closure of regional pharmacies, meaning regional Australians might face more accessibility issues in the future. \"We feel like the forgotten Australians,\" he said."

                  "articleBody": "By Jemima Burt Queensland's peak social service body says the federal government needs to do more to meet the demand for housing in Queensland. This year's budget includes a significant investment in more social housing around the country, an increase to rent assistance, and concessions for build to rent projects. But Aimee McVeigh from the Queensland Council of Social Service said research shows a significant number of Queenslanders are missing out on access to affordable housing. \"Our research shows that we have 300,000 Queenslanders with unmet housing needs … If we can see that federally the government is committing to 20,000 social houses across the country it is clear that the current plan bears no relationship to the need,\" she said. She said despite modest rises to welfare payments, there are many Queenslanders who will continue to live in poverty. \"There is in this federal budget an increase of less than $3 a day for that payment. \"Clearly it isn't enough to go anywhere near lifting those almost half a million Queenslanders out of poverty,\" Ms McVeigh said."

                  "articleBody": "By Tim Callanan Victorian social services groups have cautiously welcomed “modest” increases in support in the federal budget for people struggling with the cost of living crisis. That includes an increase to the JobSeeker rate by $40 a fortnight and the government’s energy bill relief plan. Victorian Council of Social Service CEO Emma King said there were positive moves in the budget to help vulnerable people. “There's critical support in there for single parents, people on low incomes who need health care, and it kicked off really important investment to retrofit low-income homes to improve energy efficiency,” she said. However, Ms King had one eye on the upcoming state budget, which Premier Daniel Andrews has repeatedly warned will be “tough”. “We've got a real challenge on our hands in terms of what we've got to look forward to in looking at the Victorian budget and where those cuts might be,” she said."

McKenzie: This is a missed opportunity to permanently lower people’s power bills. To meet the climate challenge head on, Australia needs to urgently unlock the most affordable energy source available, renewables. Sure, this Budget provides renewables assistance to 170,000 households. But when you consider the critical challenge of electrifying everything with renewable power, backed with storage, for 10.8 million households, that barely gets us off the starting blocks. The Labor Government has demonstrated in this Budget that they want to support Australians who are struggling. Climate change makes every Australian vulnerable, so the scale of investment on climate action needs to match the task ahead of us."

This time around, NSW will get $362 million over eight years, including for safety upgrades on the Bells Line of Road and Nowra Bypass planning. There's also $3 million to look at the feasibility of an intermodal terminal in Forbes, as part of the Inland Rail program.

                  "articleBody": "What happened to the shared equity (help to buy) scheme that Labor took to the last election? Has this been quietly shelved or is it in progress. Have heard nothing on this since 21 May. Presumably it's an inflationary measure, but still a game changer for those lagging behind the housing market  - Josh. Hi Josh! Thanks for writing in. I've passed on your question to political reporter Jake Evans who says: The Help to Buy scheme was funded in the treasurer's first budget in October last year. The federal government committed in that budget to $324.6 million over four years to establish the scheme to help people on low to moderate incomes to purchase a new or existing home with an equity contribution from the government. The treasurer said in his budget speech last year that the scheme would assist up to 40,000 people."

We know that when the vote, the postal ballot was held on marriage equality, then people in that community felt under pressure as well and we have been conscious about that.\""

She aded there was another missed opportunity to tackle the structural deficit. \"Business did all the heavy lifting last night and there is nothing to drive our investment against the backdrop of other countries who are pushing hard into this. \"The hard work is fixing and reforming government services. By that, not cost cutting but going to digital services, getting improved outcomes for people, making sure we slow the rate of growth in these services, that they are efficient and effective for people and fix all of the issues in our federation.\""

NSW will collect $4.7 billion of that funding to unlock transmission and Renewable Energy Zones in partnership with the NSW government. The state is also expected to be a beneficiary of the $2 billion allocated to the Hydrogen Headstart program, which the Albanese government says will ensure Australia becomes a renewable energy superpower.

NT Treasurer Eva Lawler’s inaugural budget features a massive infrastructure spend planned for the impending financial year, with $2.1 billion pegged mainly for the jurisdiction’s roads and housing. While the construction and mining sectors have applauded this year’s allocations, there’s not been any huge departmental increases put on the table for health, education or the NT Police force. The NT opposition, police union and territory’s social services council have all criticised the 2023 NT budget's priorities, saying more focus should've been placed on the region's most vulnerable. Opposition Leader Lia Finocchiaro said police were all but ignored in the middle of a \"crime crisis\".",

I've passed it to political reporter Jake Evans who says: There's a big \"TBC\" over the whole higher education sector, because the government is currently in negotiations with unions, universities and others to develop a \"University Accord\". That deal would be very wide-ranging, looking not only at tertiary education funding and structure, but also at student loans and loan repayment. For now, there's no new incentive schemes or loan relief, besides a technical decision by the government to forgo $21 million worth of debt it would be owed over the next decade from loans issued in 2017 and 2018 under the VET FEE-HELP program, due to delays in the transfer of those loans to the Australian Taxation Office. It means students currently paying off loans face a 7 per cent increase on June 1 when they are indexed, which will add thousands more to many student debts.",

I've put your question to political reporter Jake Evan s who says: There is no new money for long COVID management in this budget. However the federal government has committed $50 million for further research on long COVID to be paid through the Medical Research Future Fund. A parliamentary committee inquiry into long COVID and repeat infections was released just at the end of last month, which included recommendations for long COVID clinics to be established in some public hospitals, more support and education. The government is developing its national plan on long COVID which it says will consider the findings of that committee's inquiry, so we may see more on this in the future.",

The Australian Conservation Foundation's Kelly O'Shanassy welcomes investment in \"climate action, renewable energy and clean exports\", including $2 billion to speed up development of Australia's hydrogen industry and $1.3 billion towards energy efficiency in houses. \"That's really important because Australians are struggling with the cost of living and investing in energy efficiency in homes,\" she says. There was also $121 million over four years to make good on the government's promise to set up a new national body, Environment Protection Australia (EPA), as well as another $51.5 million over four years for a new environment information agency. Ms O'Shanassy says that's \"a good investment in forming a new agency\". But the public is yet to see legislation to establish a national EPA, and the Wilderness Society's Tim Beshara says the government needs to get on with it. \"The new EPA and a data collection agency is a good start for figuring out how we do address the problems that we're facing on the nature side,\" he says. \"[But] I think that's a patch-up for where we should have been. I think that should have been in last year's budget and we should have been well advanced from where we're at right now to the reform agenda.\" Both groups also say the government hasn't put any significant new money behind its ambitious goal of zero extinctions. \"There's nothing in this budget that is going to lead to additional species coming off the [endangered] list in the right way — that is not becoming extinct, but actually becoming more and more common, less and less rare,\" Beshara says. \"The Australian government has obligations for hundreds of species to have put in place a recovery plan and to fund that, and the backlog on writing those plans and implementing those plans and funding those plans is rising. \"So, until there is dedicated additional substantive funding put into endangered species recovery, things are going to continue to decline. It's hard not to see we're going to have more extinctions [under] the Albanese government.\"",

Everywhere I read it says there will be a $500 relief for energy bills for eligible households but no information as to who is eligible. - John. Hi John. Here's the lowdown from political reporter, Jake Evans: The energy relief payment will be available to pensioners, veterans, seniors and other concession card holders, as well as recipients of Carer Allowance, Family Tax Benefit and anyone eligible for existing state and territory electricity concession schemes. However, the amount you receive will differ from state to state, as the money is jointly funded and the federal government has had to strike eight different deals with each state and territory. $500 will be offered in NSW, Victoria, Queensland, South Australia and Tasmania $350 in total relief will be available in Western Australia and the territories $650 will also be available to eligible small businesses in states that have matched the relief.",

Andrews said there were positive signs in the budget for Victoria, declaring \"the decade of rip off is over.\" \"You can’t fix nine years of neglect in just one budget but there are good positive signs, but we’ll keep the pressure on, of course, because we want to get our fair share,\" he said. Mr Andrews said the health initiatives announced last night were \"a good first step\" in improving medical care across the country. \"National Cabinet agreed earlier this year that health is the number one issue and it was very pleasing to see significant investments – not everything – but a big next step in last night’s federal budget. \"Particularly, longer consultations, higher payments to GPs and higher rebates particularly for vulnerable people. This is all about a better primary care system.\" Andrews said he would discuss more moves to reform the health system at a health-only National Cabinet meeting before the end of the year. There was no money allocated last night towards the 2026 Commonwealth Games, which Victoria is hosting in regional centres, but the Premier said that doesn’t mean there won’t be a federal contribution. \"The Commonwealth Games is not happening next week so we do have time and we do have some optimism that the Albanese government will be a partner,\" he said.",

But here's national technology reporter, Danny Tran: Artificial intelligence is getting a boost, with the federal government tipping in $101.2 million over the next five years to help businesses integrate AI and quantum technologies. That includes expanding the National AI Centre and its role in making sure the technology is responsible (I, Robot, anyone?) as well as setting up the Australian Centre for Quantum Growth. Misha Schubert from Science and Technology Australia says this type of investment is important: \"Every time anyone enters a prompt or an instruction into ChatGPT or a generative AI tool, it is hoovering that up and building a complex profile about us. \"So [it is] really important that we diligently deepen our investments in ethical and responsible use of AI and the sort of safeguards around privacy and copyright and security on generative AI tools.\" Simon Bush from the Australian Information Industry Association, the peak body for the information and communications technology sector, says we have a \"very limited\" opportunity to get this technology right. \"We are competing with our trading partners, both friendly and not so friendly, in relation to areas like AI and Quantum,\" he says. \"This funding enables smaller Australian innovative companies to access government support, to commercialise their IP and their technology, to really bring that to the market and also [retain] really smart people, so [we] don't lose them overseas. \"It’s a really good down payment on securing Australia’s future.\"",

She says while the budget includes some positive investments to tackle the cost of living, the increase to the Jobseeker payment will do little to lift vulnerable people out of poverty. Julie: We know that many aspects of the cost of living are at near-record highs, including rental prices, petrol, groceries and other essentials, which makes it even less sustainable for a Jobseeker recipient to live a dignified life. We saw during the pandemic that increased payments reduced measures of poverty and housing stress, but a very modest increase of $2.80 per day will sadly make little difference to many. Our political leaders must create a fair social safety net that ensures all Jobseeker recipients can afford an adequate standard of living.",

The federal budget announced a 10 per cent increase in agricultural levies to fund biosecurity activities and organisations, expecting it to raise $153 million over three years. Littleproud told ABC NewsRadio this was an \"outrageous move\". \"They are going to tax farmers to pay for the biosecurity costs of their competitors to import product into this country, and that has to be passed on to the consumer,\" he said, adding it would not help address food price inflation. He also said regional Australians would have few benefits from Labor's cost-of-living package, stressing what was needed in regional Australia was infrastructure and new childcare places. He was also concerned that new Medicare boosts would lead to the closure of regional pharmacies, meaning regional Australians might face more accessibility issues in the future. \"We feel like the forgotten Australians,\" he said.",

This year's budget includes a significant investment in more social housing around the country, an increase to rent assistance, and concessions for build to rent projects. But Aimee McVeigh from the Queensland Council of Social Service said research shows a significant number of Queenslanders are missing out on access to affordable housing. \"Our research shows that we have 300,000 Queenslanders with unmet housing needs … If we can see that federally the government is committing to 20,000 social houses across the country it is clear that the current plan bears no relationship to the need,\" she said. She said despite modest rises to welfare payments, there are many Queenslanders who will continue to live in poverty. \"There is in this federal budget an increase of less than $3 a day for that payment. \"Clearly it isn't enough to go anywhere near lifting those almost half a million Queenslanders out of poverty,\" Ms McVeigh said.",

Victorian Council of Social Service CEO Emma King said there were positive moves in the budget to help vulnerable people. “There's critical support in there for single parents, people on low incomes who need health care, and it kicked off really important investment to retrofit low-income homes to improve energy efficiency,” she said.

McKenzie: This is a missed opportunity to permanently lower people’s power bills. To meet the climate challenge head on, Australia needs to urgently unlock the most affordable energy source available, renewables. Sure, this Budget provides renewables assistance to 170,000 households. But when you consider the critical challenge of electrifying everything with renewable power, backed with storage, for 10.8 million households, that barely gets us off the starting blocks. The Labor Government has demonstrated in this Budget that they want to support Australians who are struggling. Climate change makes every Australian vulnerable, so the scale of investment on climate action needs to match the task ahead of us.",

Well, it's not on a par with the $1.4 billion allocated to NSW infrastructure projects in the Labor government's first budget last October or the $3.3 billion in the Coalition's pre-election budget in March last year. This time around, NSW will get $362 million over eight years, including for safety upgrades on the Bells Line of Road and Nowra Bypass planning. There's also $3 million to look at the feasibility of an intermodal terminal in Forbes, as part of the Inland Rail program. The government has said the $120 billion in the pipeline of the Infrastructure Investment Program will be reviewed, working with the states and territories to determine priorities.",

I've passed on your question to political reporter Jake Evans who says: The Help to Buy scheme was funded in the treasurer's first budget in October last year. The federal government committed in that budget to $324.6 million over four years to establish the scheme to help people on low to moderate incomes to purchase a new or existing home with an equity contribution from the government. The treasurer said in his budget speech last year that the scheme would assist up to 40,000 people.",

I've put your question to political reporter Jake Evan s who says: There is no new money for long COVID management in this budget. However the federal government has committed $50 million for further research on long COVID to be paid through the Medical Research Future Fund. A parliamentary committee inquiry into long COVID and repeat infections was released just at the end of last month, which included recommendations for long COVID clinics to be established in some public hospitals, more support and education. The government is developing its national plan on long COVID which it says will consider the findings of that committee's inquiry, so we may see more on this in the future.",

In a statement, the company said it was due to \"failure to comply with reasonable Board directions\". Bubs said it had also fired its former executive chairman Dennis Lin. This is the reason the company provided for this extraordinary move: “Noting the recent deterioration in Bubs’ financial performance over the half year, the non-executive directors considered the time was right for a change in leadership and to change the governance framework of the company to ensure that it aligns with ASX corporate governance principles and best practice.\" Sacking coincides with poor financial performance What's also extaordinary is that the Bubs board of directors did not bother to hide their negativity towards their co-founder and former chairman. Normally, when a top executive is forced to quit, the business would claim they \"resigned\" due to health problems, or a desire to \"spend more time with their family\". Last year, Bubs' share price surged when the United States was experiencing an extreme shortage of baby formula. The company exported large quantities of its product to the US, and was personally thanked by President Joe Biden at a virtual roundtable of infant formula manufacturers from across the world. But since the year began, its share price has collapsed by 50%. In February, Bubs Australia reported a half-year loss of $44 million. (It was a huge downgrade compared to the $702,000 half-year loss it announced the year before). The company announced Katrina Rathie as its new chairwoman last month, while Richard Paine will act as interim CEO until a permanent replacement is found."

                  "articleBody": "Economist David Bassanese of Betashares says the \"unambiguously expansionary\" budget will fuel pressure for the Reserve Bank of Australia to lift rates - as it continues it's fight against inflation. With growth domestic product (GDP) - the value of all goods and services produced in a given period - set to lift about 1.5% over the next two years, he says that means... \"This adds to the risk that the RBA will feel the need to raise interest rates at least once and possibly twice more in the coming months\". If that comes to pass, the around one-third of Australians who are currently paying off a mortgage would be hit with higher repayments. Despite a review of the RBA calling on the central bank to give equal priority to the concepts of full employment and steady inflation between 2-3%, the bank's recent decisions have confirmed it is on a mission to lower inflation at the cost of higher unemployment. Mr Bassanese praises the budget... \"The Budget is admirable in that most of the extra budget bounty from a resilient economy and higher export commodity prices is being saved rather than spent (unlike, say, during the commodity boom under then Treasurer Peter Costello). It’s also hard to argue over the areas in which money has been spent – mainly helping the least well off in the community\" But says it should have gone harder. \"(It) again makes no real effort to tighten the budget to support monetary policy in helping to rein in inflation and tackle Australia’s now ingrained structural budget deficit. The disappointment is not that the Government has attempted to support some of the less well-off in the community, but rather that greater effort was not made at a still relatively early stage in the electoral cycle to introduce tougher measures elsewhere in the economy.\""

                  "articleBody": "Crack out the world's smallest violin to play a sad song for multinational corporations that have boosted their profit by billions through shifting it around the world ... and might not be able to do so as easily in future. My colleague, Nassim Khadem, has covered this issue for years — check out her explainer at the bottom of this post. The key issue is some multinational companies shift profits from countries with higher corporate tax rates like Australia (25-30%) to places like Singapore (17%) or the Cayman Islands (0%). It's expensive, complicated and contentious. But legal. Change is coming Treasuries around the world have gotten wise and have slowly been working together to make it harder. (Even though, at the same time, people have been working on the opposite side and trying to get around the new laws). Liam Delahunty, partner at consulting firm RSM Australia, noted new \"global minimum tax\" reforms for multinationals. This is the next phase of tax reform around the world and installs a minimum tax rate of 15 per cent. \"Australia is one of 135 countries and jurisdictions collaborating on global measures to tackle tax avoidance through  the OECD’s BEPS two-pillar reform plan – so the global minimum tax reforms are neither new nor unexpected\" But what is new, Mr Delahunty said, is the speed. \"There are firm start dates which don’t allow for any significant transition time and also come on the back of changes to thin capitalisation rules and intangible assets – both of which are due to commence from income years commencing on or after 1 July 2023, but are yet to be legislated.\" What this means is the 15 per cent global minimum tax for large multinational enterprises will kick in from 1 January 2024. There are only \"very modest revenue projections\" from the measures, so the government doesn't foresee a bounty of riches coming from it. But it may stop the money-shuffle, and see more of it land here in Australia where the profits are being made."

                  "articleBody": "We have a big update on Latitude's cyberattack. Regulators across Australia and New Zealand are now investigating the financial service company's customer data retention policies and protection. Latitude was hit by a cyber-attack in March. At least 7.9 million Australian and NZ drivers licences were eventually confirmed as stolen, and 6.1 million customer records. Some of the customer data stolen was provided before 2013 — including some dating back to 2005. It included information from before Latitude was Latitude, and was instead an entity under GE Money. Now, the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC) and the New Zealand Office of the Privacy Commissioner (OPC) have commenced a joint investigation into the company's personal information handling practices. In joint statement they said: The OAIC investigation will focus on whether Latitude took reasonable steps to protect the personal information they held from misuse, interference, loss, unauthorised access, modification or disclosure.

One of the noteworthy incentives was an amnesty for some businesses that are behind on their taxes. So if your business tax bill was due between 31 December 2019 and 29 February 2022 and you still haven't paid it, the ATO won't fine you if you lodge your taxes by the end of this year. But that only applies to small businesses with yearly turnover of less than $10 million. The government is also offering tax rebates for investments in 'electrification' (say, if they bought heat pumps, battery storage, induction, and energy efficient fridges).

                  "articleBody": "As a person, your credit rating is a summary of whether you're a 'good risk'. If you're not — say you've been late with paying your bills or defaulted on a mortgage — you'll pay a higher interest rates on loans to take account of the fact you're more risky (for the lender) than other people. For nations, it's similar. Ratings agencies work out if you, a company or a nation are a 'good risk'. New comments from Fitch Ratings in the wake of the 2023 Australian federal budget are broadly supportive \"The return to a underlying cash surplus in the current fiscal year and clear improvement in the federal government's fiscal position over the budget's forecast horizon is supportive of Australia's 'AAA' sovereign rating,\" said Jeremy Zook, director, sovereigns, APAC at Fitch Ratings. \"Fiscal outcomes are stronger than what we expected when we last affirmed Australia's rating with a Stable outlook in December 2022.\" It also says the budget won't boost inflation. \"The government's decision to allow higher than expected revenue collection to flow through to improved budget outcomes by keeping spending relatively contained, points to a commitment to its fiscal strategy and is not likely to contribute to inflationary pressures in the economy. We think the budget assumptions are reasonable and commodity price assumptions remain modest compared to our forecasts. Still, downside risks persist given the weak global outlook, elevated inflation and high interest rates Mr Zook does see \"structural budget pressures\" over the medium-term and warns that risks to the rating could build with spending demands \"particularly the NDIS\"."

Investors traded more cautiously ahead of a meeting between US President Joe Biden, Republican House Speaker Kevin McCarthy and other congressional leaders at the White House on Tuesday (local time), to discuss the debt ceiling stand-off. The Dow Jones, S & P 500 and Nasdaq Composite fell by 0.2%, 0.5% and 0.6%, respectively. Markets are waiting to hear the outcome of a meeting on Tuesday (local time) between US President Joe Biden, Worries of a potential government default loom over Washington as early as June 1, if Congress does not act to resolve the deadlock. The Democratic president is calling on lawmakers to raise the federal government's self-imposed borrowing limit without conditions. But the Republican House speaker, Mr McCarthy, has said his chamber will not approve any deal that does not cut spending to address a growing budget deficit. Past debt ceiling fights have typically ended with a hastily arranged agreement in the final hours of negotiations, thus avoiding a default. In 2011, the scramble prompted a downgrade of the country's top-notch credit rating. Veterans of that battle warn the current situation is even riskier because political divides have widened. Economists warn a lengthy default could send the US economy into a deep recession with soaring unemployment, while destabilising the global financial system that's built on US bonds."

In a statement, the company said it was due to \"failure to comply with reasonable Board directions\". Bubs said it had also fired its former executive chairman Dennis Lin. This is the reason the company provided for this extraordinary move: “Noting the recent deterioration in Bubs’ financial performance over the half year, the non-executive directors considered the time was right for a change in leadership and to change the governance framework of the company to ensure that it aligns with ASX corporate governance principles and best practice.\" Sacking coincides with poor financial performance What's also extaordinary is that the Bubs board of directors did not bother to hide their negativity towards their co-founder and former chairman. Normally, when a top executive is forced to quit, the business would claim they \"resigned\" due to health problems, or a desire to \"spend more time with their family\". Last year, Bubs' share price surged when the United States was experiencing an extreme shortage of baby formula. The company exported large quantities of its product to the US, and was personally thanked by President Joe Biden at a virtual roundtable of infant formula manufacturers from across the world. But since the year began, its share price has collapsed by 50%. In February, Bubs Australia reported a half-year loss of $44 million. (It was a huge downgrade compared to the $702,000 half-year loss it announced the year before). The company announced Katrina Rathie as its new chairwoman last month, while Richard Paine will act as interim CEO until a permanent replacement is found.",

With growth domestic product (GDP) - the value of all goods and services produced in a given period - set to lift about 1.5% over the next two years, he says that means... \"This adds to the risk that the RBA will feel the need to raise interest rates at least once and possibly twice more in the coming months\". If that comes to pass, the around one-third of Australians who are currently paying off a mortgage would be hit with higher repayments. Despite a review of the RBA calling on the central bank to give equal priority to the concepts of full employment and steady inflation between 2-3%, the bank's recent decisions have confirmed it is on a mission to lower inflation at the cost of higher unemployment. Mr Bassanese praises the budget... \"The Budget is admirable in that most of the extra budget bounty from a resilient economy and higher export commodity prices is being saved rather than spent (unlike, say, during the commodity boom under then Treasurer Peter Costello). It’s also hard to argue over the areas in which money has been spent – mainly helping the least well off in the community\" But says it should have gone harder. \"(It) again makes no real effort to tighten the budget to support monetary policy in helping to rein in inflation and tackle Australia’s now ingrained structural budget deficit. The disappointment is not that the Government has attempted to support some of the less well-off in the community, but rather that greater effort was not made at a still relatively early stage in the electoral cycle to introduce tougher measures elsewhere in the economy.\"",

My colleague, Nassim Khadem, has covered this issue for years — check out her explainer at the bottom of this post. The key issue is some multinational companies shift profits from countries with higher corporate tax rates like Australia (25-30%) to places like Singapore (17%) or the Cayman Islands (0%). It's expensive, complicated and contentious. But legal. Change is coming Treasuries around the world have gotten wise and have slowly been working together to make it harder. (Even though, at the same time, people have been working on the opposite side and trying to get around the new laws). Liam Delahunty, partner at consulting firm RSM Australia, noted new \"global minimum tax\" reforms for multinationals. This is the next phase of tax reform around the world and installs a minimum tax rate of 15 per cent. \"Australia is one of 135 countries and jurisdictions collaborating on global measures to tackle tax avoidance through  the OECD’s BEPS two-pillar reform plan – so the global minimum tax reforms are neither new nor unexpected\" But what is new, Mr Delahunty said, is the speed. \"There are firm start dates which don’t allow for any significant transition time and also come on the back of changes to thin capitalisation rules and intangible assets – both of which are due to commence from income years commencing on or after 1 July 2023, but are yet to be legislated.\" What this means is the 15 per cent global minimum tax for large multinational enterprises will kick in from 1 January 2024. There are only \"very modest revenue projections\" from the measures, so the government doesn't foresee a bounty of riches coming from it. But it may stop the money-shuffle, and see more of it land here in Australia where the profits are being made.",

Regulators across Australia and New Zealand are now investigating the financial service company's customer data retention policies and protection. Latitude was hit by a cyber-attack in March. At least 7.9 million Australian and NZ drivers licences were eventually confirmed as stolen, and 6.1 million customer records. Some of the customer data stolen was provided before 2013 — including some dating back to 2005. It included information from before Latitude was Latitude, and was instead an entity under GE Money. Now, the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC) and the New Zealand Office of the Privacy Commissioner (OPC) have commenced a joint investigation into the company's personal information handling practices. In joint statement they said: The OAIC investigation will focus on whether Latitude took reasonable steps to protect the personal information they held from misuse, interference, loss, unauthorised access, modification or disclosure. The investigation will also consider whether Latitude took reasonable steps to destroy or de-identify personal information that was no longer required. If the investigation finds serious and/or repeated interferences with privacy in contravention of Australian privacy law, then the Commissioner has the power to seek civil penalties through the Federal Court of up to $50 million for each contravention. Six entities under Latitude are being investigated. The company has a range of services, including pay-day lending, buy now pay later services with retailers, and insurance across Australia and NZ. We have contacted the company for comment. Send our journalist an email on terzon.emilia@abc.net.au if you are a Latitude customer who is worried about your data.",

If you're not — say you've been late with paying your bills or defaulted on a mortgage — you'll pay a higher interest rates on loans to take account of the fact you're more risky (for the lender) than other people. For nations, it's similar. Ratings agencies work out if you, a company or a nation are a 'good risk'. New comments from Fitch Ratings in the wake of the 2023 Australian federal budget are broadly supportive \"The return to a underlying cash surplus in the current fiscal year and clear improvement in the federal government's fiscal position over the budget's forecast horizon is supportive of Australia's 'AAA' sovereign rating,\" said Jeremy Zook, director, sovereigns, APAC at Fitch Ratings. \"Fiscal outcomes are stronger than what we expected when we last affirmed Australia's rating with a Stable outlook in December 2022.\" It also says the budget won't boost inflation. \"The government's decision to allow higher than expected revenue collection to flow through to improved budget outcomes by keeping spending relatively contained, points to a commitment to its fiscal strategy and is not likely to contribute to inflationary pressures in the economy. We think the budget assumptions are reasonable and commodity price assumptions remain modest compared to our forecasts. Still, downside risks persist given the weak global outlook, elevated inflation and high interest rates Mr Zook does see \"structural budget pressures\" over the medium-term and warns that risks to the rating could build with spending demands \"particularly the NDIS\".",

The Dow Jones, S & P 500 and Nasdaq Composite fell by 0.2%, 0.5% and 0.6%, respectively. Markets are waiting to hear the outcome of a meeting on Tuesday (local time) between US President Joe Biden, Worries of a potential government default loom over Washington as early as June 1, if Congress does not act to resolve the deadlock. The Democratic president is calling on lawmakers to raise the federal government's self-imposed borrowing limit without conditions. But the Republican House speaker, Mr McCarthy, has said his chamber will not approve any deal that does not cut spending to address a growing budget deficit. Past debt ceiling fights have typically ended with a hastily arranged agreement in the final hours of negotiations, thus avoiding a default. In 2011, the scramble prompted a downgrade of the country's top-notch credit rating. Veterans of that battle warn the current situation is even riskier because political divides have widened. Economists warn a lengthy default could send the US economy into a deep recession with soaring unemployment, while destabilising the global financial system that's built on US bonds.",

In a statement, the company said it was due to \"failure to comply with reasonable Board directions\". Bubs said it had also fired its former executive chairman Dennis Lin. This is the reason the company provided for this extraordinary move: “Noting the recent deterioration in Bubs’ financial performance over the half year, the non-executive directors considered the time was right for a change in leadership and to change the governance framework of the company to ensure that it aligns with ASX corporate governance principles and best practice.\" Sacking coincides with poor financial performance What's also extaordinary is that the Bubs board of directors did not bother to hide their negativity towards their co-founder and former chairman. Normally, when a top executive is forced to quit, the business would claim they \"resigned\" due to health problems, or a desire to \"spend more time with their family\". Last year, Bubs' share price surged when the United States was experiencing an extreme shortage of baby formula. The company exported large quantities of its product to the US, and was personally thanked by President Joe Biden at a virtual roundtable of infant formula manufacturers from across the world. But since the year began, its share price has collapsed by 50%. In February, Bubs Australia reported a half-year loss of $44 million. (It was a huge downgrade compared to the $702,000 half-year loss it announced the year before). The company announced Katrina Rathie as its new chairwoman last month, while Richard Paine will act as interim CEO until a permanent replacement is found.",

Regulators across Australia and New Zealand are now investigating the financial service company's customer data retention policies and protection. Latitude was hit by a cyber-attack in March. At least 7.9 million Australian and NZ drivers licences were eventually confirmed as stolen, and 6.1 million customer records. Some of the customer data stolen was provided before 2013 — including some dating back to 2005. It included information from before Latitude was Latitude, and was instead an entity under GE Money. Now, the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC) and the New Zealand Office of the Privacy Commissioner (OPC) have commenced a joint investigation into the company's personal information handling practices. In joint statement they said: The OAIC investigation will focus on whether Latitude took reasonable steps to protect the personal information they held from misuse, interference, loss, unauthorised access, modification or disclosure. The investigation will also consider whether Latitude took reasonable steps to destroy or de-identify personal information that was no longer required. If the investigation finds serious and/or repeated interferences with privacy in contravention of Australian privacy law, then the Commissioner has the power to seek civil penalties through the Federal Court of up to $50 million for each contravention. Six entities under Latitude are being investigated. The company has a range of services, including pay-day lending, buy now pay later services with retailers, and insurance across Australia and NZ. We have contacted the company for comment. Send our journalist an email on terzon.emilia@abc.net.au if you are a Latitude customer who is worried about your data.",

Investors traded more cautiously ahead of a meeting between US President Joe Biden, Republican House Speaker Kevin McCarthy and other congressional leaders at the White House on Tuesday (local time), to discuss the debt ceiling stand-off. The Dow Jones, S & P 500 and Nasdaq Composite fell by 0.2%, 0.5% and 0.6%, respectively. Markets are waiting to hear the outcome of a meeting on Tuesday (local time) between US President Joe Biden, Worries of a potential government default loom over Washington as early as June 1, if Congress does not act to resolve the deadlock. The Democratic president is calling on lawmakers to raise the federal government's self-imposed borrowing limit without conditions. But the Republican House speaker, Mr McCarthy, has said his chamber will not approve any deal that does not cut spending to address a growing budget deficit. Past debt ceiling fights have typically ended with a hastily arranged agreement in the final hours of negotiations, thus avoiding a default. In 2011, the scramble prompted a downgrade of the country's top-notch credit rating. Veterans of that battle warn the current situation is even riskier because political divides have widened. Economists warn a lengthy default could send the US economy into a deep recession with soaring unemployment, while destabilising the global financial system that's built on US bonds.",
