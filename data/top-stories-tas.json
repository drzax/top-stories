Because the Japanese central bank's governor has suggested that it could end its negative interest rate policy, with its 2% inflation target in sight — paving the way for possible interest rate hikes. Last weekend, governor Kazudo Ueda told the Yomiuri newspaper that the Bank of Japan could have enough data by the end of the year to determine whether it could end negative rates. \"Once we're convinced Japan will see sustained rises in inflation accompanied by wage growth, there are various options we can take ,\" Ueda was quoted as saying. \"If we judge that Japan can achieve its inflation target even after ending negative rates, we'll do so .\" The BOJ currently guides short-term interest rates at -0.1% under its negative rate policy, and caps the 10-year government bond yield around zero as part of efforts to reflate the economy and sustainably achieve its target. With inflation exceeding its 2% target for more than a year, markets have been rife with speculation the BOJ will soon start raising interest rates. It's that speculation that markets are keenly looking out for with Friday's decision, and any signs that the BOJ might be moving away from its ultra-loose policy faster than previously thought.",

                "plaintext": "If you missed this last week, United Auto Workers are striking against Detroit's \"Big Three\" automakers after failing to reach a deal on new contracts. UAW members went on strike on Friday at General Motors, Ford and Stellantis, and is considered the most ambitious US industrial labour action in decades. It's the first time the UAW has gone on strike at all three automakers at the same time. Unions and representatives at the \"Detroit Three\" are set to resume talks, but there appears to be no immediate resolution on the horizon. Around 12,700 UAW workers are on strike as part of the coordinated labour action, which is targeting the three assembly plants after their previous four-year labour agreements ended at midnight last Thursday. General Motors, Ford and Stellantis make up around 40% of the US market. Along with higher wages, the UAW is demanding shorter work weeks, restoring defined benefit pensions, and stronger job security as automakers shift towards EVs. Should the strike widen to include all 146,000 UAW members at the three companies, it could be the largest automotive industry strike in 25 years — since more than 150,000 GM workers walked off the job for nearly two months in 1998. If that action widens, that would put \"half a billion [US] dollars per day\" at risk in the US economy, according to RSM's chief US economist Joe Brusuelas, and slow the country's economy considerably. \"While that amount is large in nominal dollar terms, it would not be large enough to tip the economy into recession ,\" Mr Bruselas said last week. \"In the end, the impact of a such a strike would be modest compared to previous generations.\"",

The RBA will release the minutes from its September meeting at 11:30am AEST tomorrow, after it decided to leave interest rates on hold at 4.1% again at its September 5 meeting. So why are investors so eagerly waiting for this? Because they're looking for clues about future interest rate decisions and how the economy is tracking — especially with inflation still above the RBA's 2-3% target. The RBA's statement on its latest monetary policy decision noted that services inflation was a sticking point in the economy, as it is globally, and there were \"significant\" uncertainties around the outlook — adding to the central bank's statement that future rate rises may be needed to curb inflation. We'll bring you the highlights from those minutes in tomorrow's blog, but if you're wanting to refresh your memory with this month's decision, here's the story from Rachel Pupazzoni and I two weeks ago:",
