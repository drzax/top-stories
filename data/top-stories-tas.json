Instead, she blazed a trail of her own, truth-telling the history of Australia that many Australians didn't hear at school, through her award-winning films and TV programs. Much of the Arrernte and Kalkadoon writer, producer and director's career, spans over 30 years, unearthing Australia's history through the eyes and voices of First Nations people. Her seven-part series, First Australians, received notable industry awards including the UN Media Peace Prize, TV Week Logie Award and an Australian Writers and Directors Guild Award. Not only was it Australia's bestselling educational title, but it sold out across the world. When accepting the Creative Talent award, Perkins paid tribute to Indigenous Australians Minister Linda Burney and last year's Lifetime Achievement award-winner Pat Anderson. \"These two women are leading us with the Uluru Statement from the Heart, and we're taking Australia on a journey to 'Yes' this year — stand with us, Australia,\" she said.

The proud Larrakia man from Darwin is the co-founder of Something Wild Australia, an Indigenous owned company that supplies native ingredients like magpie goose, green ants, Kakadu plums and bush apples to restaurants and supermarkets across the nation. Motlop was emotional when he accepted the Innovation Award : \"That is a bit overwhelming. I didn't think I'd be standing here 10 years out of football and accepting an award for food ,\" he says. \"I'd like to thank the NAIDOC committee ... You run a business and obviously try to make profit and make money, and try to be better for your family. \"You don't want to just be seen as an Indigenous business, so I tried to really elevate that and become a mainstream business in what we do, whether it be a green ant in bush apple gin — things that are native to Australia — we put them in a commercial product so people can try them and take them and make them the norm .\"",
