The stock hit a new low of HK$0.86, following reports on Friday the company was heading for a debt restructuring that added to concerns about the deteriorating outlook in the property sector. Markets are jittery as more developers default on bond payments amid no signs of stronger support measures from Beijing.

CBA commodity analyst Vivek Dhar explains why. \"The resiliency of global oil demand combined with OPEC+ oil supply cuts has already tightened oil markets,\" he explains. \" Brent futures rose above $US88/bbl in intra day trading on 10 August, but has since eased below $US87/bbl. Futures were as low as $US72/bbl on 27 June. \" Saudi Arabia's pledge to voluntarily cut 1mb/d (~1% of global supply) in Q3 2023 has played a crucial role in driving oil prices higher. The IEA [International Energy Agency] noted that Saudi Arabia's oil output fell by 0.95mb/d last month. \" Russia has also committed to reduce oil exports from August (0.5mb/d cut in August and a 0.3mb/d cut in September). The IEA reported that Russia's crude oil exports fell 0.2mb/d to 4.6mb/d in July, marking the lowest level since December 2022.\" The resiliency in demand is expected to continue, at least in the short term, with the IEA upping its forecasts for this year and holding them steady for next. \"The IEA now anticipate that global oil demand will grow 2.2% in 2023 (previously 2.1%), before slowing to 1% (previously 1.1%) next year,\" writes Dhar. \"The slight upgrade to the IEA's oil demand forecast for 2023 is broadly consistent with global oil demand rising to record highs of 103mb/d in June. Oil demand has strengthened because of \"strong summer air travel, increased oil use in power generation and surging petrochemical activity.\" The IEA noted that global oil demand in August may eclipse June levels. \"The fall in global oil demand growth next year is tied primarily to increased fuel efficiency, higher uptake of electric vehicles (EVs) and reduced demand growth from China. \"Increased fuel efficiency and the uptake of EVs are expected to suppress global oil demand in later years too. In June, the IEA released a view on oil demand trends to 2028. Oil demand was expected to grow ~1% in 2025, just like in 2024, before slowing to ~0.4% by 2028.\"",
