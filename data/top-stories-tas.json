(FYI the same source has a 57.3 per cent chance the Reserve Bank of Australia will pause - that number has been moving around quite a bit in the past two days) But back to the US. The research team and ANZ bank have sent through a note saying they expect the rate will remain on hold, but the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) will maintain its tightening bias. The team at ANZ think the sharp rise in bond yields reduces the need for further central bank tightening. As we all know, the rate hikes are to bring inflation down. In the US it's currently 3.7 per cent. That's still above it's target. Economists around the globe will be watching closely what the US central bank does, as well as the commentary from Chairman Jerome Powell at the conclusion of the meeting... because as the saying goes, when the US sneezes... we catch a cold.",
