More than 15 years since the Intervention, many Aboriginal leaders say it left NT communities disempowered and disenfranchised, and contributed to the level of social issues faced today. Ms Martin was the Labor NT government's leader when then-prime minister John Howard's Coalition triggered the Intervention, to try to combat what it believed at the time was a surge in sexual assaults against children. \"If there's ever anywhere that needs a strong national Voice to stop federal governments doing really stupid things in the territory, then it's this Voice,\" Ms Martin said. \"I'm a product of the Intervention, which John Howard did because he wanted to win votes elsewhere. \"That was an extraordinary waste of money and a damage for Aboriginal people. \"If we had a Voice, we would never have had an Intervention.\" Mr Howard last week told an Australians for Constitutional Monarchy conference that he defended his government's decision to start the Intervention, saying it was a \"recognition that … the Northern Territory government, had completely failed in its responsibilities\".",

There is no player in this draft as skilful as Nick Watson. He kicks goals most players couldn't dream of pulling off. He's a small forward who works hand all over the ground, and has had proven impact as a pinch-hitting midfielder. Sounds pretty good, right? What's the downside? The knock on Watson is he is 170cm tall. That makes him shorter than Caleb Daniel. But as Daniel, Brent Harvey and so many others have proven over the journey, height matters little when your football talent is immense enough. And in Watson's case, it certainly is. Concerns over his height won't be enough to deter clubs from making him a top-10 pick, but it might be enough to spook clubs right up the very top end. What is certain is that whoever picks him up is going to be treated to plenty of highlights, and one set of fans is going to have a new cult hero to love.",

Well, things are getting worse. The latest inflation rate data just came out for the South American country. Prices have gone up 12.7% in September and the annual figure is now 138%. In response, their central bank has hiked rates again from 118% to 133%. Many economists there think it will end the year at more than 180%. This all just comes 10 days before voters there go to the polls. The worsening surging prices have sapped wages and savings and pushed two out of every five people in Argentina below the poverty line. Inflation has been getting worse there since the government's near-18% devaluation of the peso in mid-August. A rapid freefall of Argentina's peso has since followed. Voters will be choosing who to succeed outgoing leftist President Alberto Fernandez, with radical libertarian Javier Milei seen as the front-runner due to his shock first-place showing in the August primary. Milei is seeking to shut the central bank and dollarize the economy to tame inflation. If you'd like more background on this situation, ABC's Foreign Correspondent had this great story this month.",

As you will see, Wall Street ended in the red and the futures for Australian markets show we will likely follow. The CPI data shows that price hikes aren't over in the world's biggest economy, with headline rising above consensus estimates by 0.3% a month and core inflation about the same. That, of course, is creating concern that the US federal reserve will raise rates again to tackle price spikes. This note from CBA this morning: Notwithstanding, we doubt the downtrend in inflation has been thrown off course.  The outlook for the US consumer is poor given the resumption of student loan repayments, lower government benefit payments, and the erosion of pandemic savings.  At the same time, interest rates on consumer loans have risen sharply to very high levels.  Indeed, some FOMC officials have recently said the rise in yields may substitute for further FOMC tightening.  Our baseline remains for the FOMC to keep the Funds rate steady into early 2024.  We consider the FOMC’s significant policy tightening will lead the global economy into recession. Recession fears are also being sparked by the devastating crisis in the Middle East. Here is a piece by our business reporter Nassim Khadem to get you started this morning.",

The outlook for the US consumer is poor given the resumption of student loan repayments, lower government benefit payments, and the erosion of pandemic savings.  At the same time, interest rates on consumer loans have risen sharply to very high levels.  Indeed, some FOMC officials have recently said the rise in yields may substitute for further FOMC tightening.  Our baseline remains for the FOMC to keep the Funds rate steady into early 2024.  We consider the FOMC’s significant policy tightening will lead the global economy into recession."
