European Union lawmakers have agreed on changes to draft AI rules to include a ban on the use of the technology in biometric surveillance, and for generative AI systems like ChatGPT to disclose AI-generated content. The amendments to the EU Commission's proposed landmark law aimed at protecting citizens from the dangers of the technology could set up a clash with EU countries opposed to a total ban on AI use in biometric surveillance. \"While Big Tech companies are sounding the alarm over their own creations, Europe has gone ahead and proposed a concrete response to the risks AI is starting to pose,\" says Brando Benifei, co-rapporteur of the bill. Among other changes, European Union lawmakers want any company using generative tools to disclose copyrighted material used to train its systems and for companies working on \"high-risk application\" to do a fundamental rights impact assessment and evaluate environmental impact. Systems like ChatGPT would have to disclose that the content was AI-generated, help distinguish so-called deep-fake images from real ones and ensure safeguards against illegal content. The lawmakers will now have to thrash out details with EU countries before the draft rules become legislation.",
