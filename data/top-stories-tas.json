Crews were called back to the Bonogin Valley at 6:40am on Wednesday, following reports a fire they believe was deliberately lit yesterday reignited. Six fires were lit along a road on Tuesday, prompting crews to respond rapidly to stop them spreading in the dry, hot conditions. Chief Superintendent Alan Gillespie said crews managed to get to the fires quickly. \"We were able to scramble resources fairly quickly and they are all out but we will be quite vigilant\" Mr Gillespie said. \"It is just incredible that people are doing stupid things like that,\" he said A Queensland Fire and Emergency Services (QFES) spokesman said the reignited fire had been extinguished. Mr Gillespie says they have a number of leads, and that police are investigating. \"I just can't understand the mentality of people who go out and put the community and our firefighters on the line and under risk just for some perverse thrill of seeing vehicles responding to fires.\" Queensland Police have been contacted for comment.",

It turns out that there are still more Aussies moving from the capital cities to the regions than vice versa, with recent years seeing the reversal of a decades long population drain from regional areas. \"In the 12 months to September 2023, capital to regional migration accounted for an 11% share of all relocations, compared to 9.1% making the move from the regions to the city,\" the report found. While newly arrived migrants from overseas overwhelmingly tend to settle in the big capitals, particularly Sydney and Melbourne, existing residents are still exiting the big smoke, especially Sydney. A stunning 80% of net capital city outflows came from Sydney, with a further 27% from Melbourne — the reason those two cities exceed 100% is that Brisbane (11%) and Perth (5%) are still attracting a lot of internal migrants. In terms of where these people are moving, it is often still reasonably close to home, with regional NSW now the most popular destination (39% of people who left a capital city moved there), followed by Queensland (33%) and Victoria (27%). As for exactly where people are moving, Queensland's Sunshine Coast continued to top the list, followed by Greater Geelong and the Gold Coast in a tie for second, then the Fraser Coast in Queensland and Moorabool in regional Victoria. Lake Macquarie in NSW is also among the most popular destinations for previous city dwellers. As for the biggest growth areas for city slickers to move to over the past year, Mackay in northern Queensland topped the list, along with Douglas and the Whitsundays from the same part of the world, with the Snowy Valleys in NSW and Ceduna in South Australia also making the list. \"The increasing popularity of these more remote regional growth hotspots, boosted by good regional job prospects and the likelihood of better house prices and availability, has seen some previously popular LGAs come off the boil,\" the report noted. \"For example, LGAs that had amongst the highest net internal migration inflows a year ago (to September 2022) but reported net outflows over the past 12 months include big regional New South Wales centres such as Wagga Wagga, Dubbo, Bathurst, Albury, Lismore, Newcastle, Byron and Orange as well as Mount Gambier in South Australia and West Tamar in Tasmania.\"",

              "plaintext": "New research from Roy Morgan shows a record high 1.57 million mortgage holders, representing 30.3 per cent of mortgage holders were \"at risk\" of mortgage stress in the three months to September. The figures for September, which cover the period of the three RBA meetings at which interest rates were left unchanged, represent a new record high, up 7,000 on a month ago. The number of Australians \"at risk\" of mortgage stress has increased by 766,000 since May 2022 when the RBA began a cycle of interest rate increases. The record high of 35.6 per cent of mortgage holders in mortgage stress was reached in mid-2008, during the global financial crisis. Other data released today by Core Logic, shows national home prices rose 0.9 per cent in October, with the biggest increases were in Perth (+1.6 per cent), Brisbane (+1.4 per cent) and Adelaide (+1.4 per cent). Ray Morgan says the number of mortgage holders considered \"extremely at risk\" — if even the \"interest only\" component of a loan is over a certain proportion of household income — is now numbered at 1.43 million (20.5 per cent) which is significantly above the long-term average over the last 15 years of 15.3 per cent. The RBA cash rate is currently at 4.10 per cent — the highest official interest rates since May 2012. Roy Morgan has modelled the impact of two potential RBA interest rate increases of 0.25 per cent in both November and December, which would take the cash rate to 4.6 per cent. It says the numbers of mortgage holders in stress would increase to 1.58 million, or 30.4 per cent — an increase of 8,000 — if the RBA increases interest rates next week. Then, if the RBA raises interest rates by a further 0.25 per cent in December to 4.6 per cent, there will be 31 per cent of mortgage holders, or 1.61 million considered \"at risk\" — an increase of 39,000. Ray Morgan CEO Michele Levine says the RBA left interest rates unchanged at its last four meetings, but with last month's inflation read higher, \"these pressures are adding to calls for the RBA to raise interest rates again and are a key factor for why we have modelled two further interest rate increases\". Mortgage stress is measured by when mortgage repayments are greater than a certain percentage of household income. Interest rates are only one of the variables that determines whether a mortgage holder is considered \"at risk\". The variable that has the largest impact on whether a borrower falls into the \"at risk\" category is related to household income — which is directly related to employment. \"If there is a sharp rise in unemployment, mortgage stress is set to increase even more,\" Ms Levine said.",
